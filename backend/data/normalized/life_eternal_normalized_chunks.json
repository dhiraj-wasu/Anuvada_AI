    "text": "AGENTS \nMeher Baba \nHigher spirits are actually Agents of God with \npowers and certain duties. They have physical forms in order to work in the \nworld according to the directives issued by the Perfect Masters. \n2 June 1925, Meherabad, LM2 p720 \nThose who return after Realisation are Perfect Masters, and they have Agents. One who is \nhere controls the whole universe of Agents. Perfect Masters control the whole universe, and \nyet they remain aloof. They are in the ocean, in the descent and ascent, in reincarnation, \neverything and everyone, and yet aloof. Now the Emperor, who is head of all Masters, \ncontrols all, also the Masters. \nNow Agents are of two types: with form, and without form. Agents are between descent and \nman. How do Agents work? This is most interesting. The Agents without form have no \nconnection with other Agents, because they have not undergone the process of evolution. \nBut they are powerful. They have no mind, no desire, no form, but they are spirits, and exist, \nand are like sparks. One who gets Illumination can see them, even with their eyes. Here, \nnow, are so many. They have no mind, yet can hear and see, because they feel. What they do \nis whatever they see and hear. Through feeling they pass it on to the unconscious ocean. \nWhat they report comes up to the point of creation, the point after ascent. So that message \ngoes to the Perfect Masters. Everything these millions of Agents see or hear goes to the \nPerfect Masters. \nThe Agents in bodies with minds (with form) are not Perfect, but powerful. There are \ndifferent types: Avtad, Abdal, Afreed and Afsoony. The first type, Avtad, are those who \nreceive messages and give messages, like wireless operators, to the Perfect Masters. The \nsecond type, Abdal, are those who can disappear at will, or appear thousands of mile away \nwith external bodies. But how do they disappear? The form dissolves in a twinkling of an \neye and appears somewhere else. To do what? When these Avtads send messages to Perfect \nMasters, it passes through the second form, Abdals, and if in any of the messages something \nis serious, the Abdal goes there. \nI will give an example. Once, in the time of Piran, a Perfect Master, some of his disciples \nwere coming to India from Arabia in a small boat. The boat was on the point of capsizing. \nThe Avtad at once sent messages to Piran, and the Abdals appeared there and saved the \nboat. Piran knew all this, but even before his ordering, the Abdals had done it. Piran began \nto bleed, and the other disciples who were with him asked why he was bleeding, and so he \ntold them. \nNow you know what the Avtads and Abdals do. The real work is done by Afreed and \nAfsoony. The man you saw today by the Shalimar gate was an Avtad. Avtads always appear \nmad. Afreed and afsoony appear sane. I will show you one of the Afsoony before returning \nto Bombay - most powerful. He can even create forms. Yet they (the Afsoony) are not \nPerfect. Only one thing is real: the infinite ocean of love. All else is illusion. This ocean of \nlove can be attained through love, and by loving the Perfect Master you are loving the ocean. \nI receive billions of messages every day, but let them pass over me. Only important \nmessages I deal with myself... \nSo you are all one with the ocean, but yet separate... \nJesus only once explained about Agents to his disciples. \n20 April 1933, Kashmir, \nHM p459-462 \nWhile thus working I leave my physical body, which would be dead to all feelings of touch, \nand I would not feel it even if the body were hammered or cut up. But I draw a boundary all \naround, of a radius of fifty yards, so that none can come in. Anyone trying to cross the \nboundary line would drop dead instantaneously. That's why I told Kaka to keep watch at a \ndistance of one hundred yards. When I work like this, meetings are held where spirits, my \nAgents, attend in numbers, unseen by the common eye, but sometimes visible and audible. \nAbout his seclusion at Fallenfluh \n12 July 1934, Fallenfluh, Switzerland, Aw 16:2 p9 \nWhen I work like this, a meeting of large numbers of my Agents is held, but you cannot see \nthem with your Gross eyes. Sometimes, though, you can hear a rumble like boot steps. \n12 July 1934, Fallenfluh, Switzerland, LM6 p1901 \nWhen I work universally, through Agents, mind being universal, it is linked up with every \nindividual mind... even with advanced minds, who are my Agents. And so in every part of the \nworld I am present and working through Agents. That is why, at times, while speaking to \none person, my mind is working elsewhere. People have seen and marked me stopping \nsuddenly in the midst of conversation, as if absent and away from the spot, and engrossed in \nsomething else... \nQ. How do the Agents know? \nBaba: Only those who are on the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh planes, and who are \nconscious of me, know under and for whom they are working physically. And this \nknowledge they have through the medium of their Subtle and Mental bodies. One in \nRishikesh never saw me but knows me. They cannot see me physically. But their Subtle and \nMental bodies being detached from the Gross, they see my Subtle body, which is similar to \nmy Gross.  And the consciousness of the planes they are in makes their spirits know the \nindividual behind my Subtle body. So they know that they work under me, whose Subtle \nbody they see, and which is similar to my physical form. They also know that I am one with \nthe infinite. \nFor example, while I am sitting here, my Agents are working in India, Persia, Africa, and so \non. This very moment they see my Subtle body, all at the same time, in the different planes. \nBecause the messages they send are sent through the Mental plane, where there is only the \nwill to do a thing, and instantaneously it reaches the desired spot... \nQ: How do they become Agents? \nBaba: Mostly due to past connections with me. Those connected with me in past lives \nbecome Agents. Those deeply connected become members of the Circle. \n1930s, A p31-33, also HM p462-463 \nQutub in Sufism means Center. That Center controls the whole universe through his Agents. \nMeetings are held, but these meetings cannot be seen with the physical eye. \nThe Agents who control the Gross only are called Abdals. They are capable of changing their \nbodies. The Urdu word badal  means change. Abdal, therefore, is one who can change. \n7 February 1937, Rahuri, LM6 p2091 Also Aw 16:2 p42 \nThere are... certain people who are Agents of the Saheb-e-Zaman (Avatar). These Agents are \nholders of definite and distinct offices. Just as the Christ-state, the Nabuwat-e-Mohammedi \n(or whatever name it is known by) is actually the office held by each Saheb-e-Zaman, so \nthese states of the Agents are distinct offices held by certain souls who carry out important \nwork for each Saheb-e-Zaman. On the death of one Agent, his office is automatically filled by \na successor. For just as there is always a Saheb-e-Zaman or a Saheb-e-Waqt, so there are \nalways his Agents. \nBaba explains that there are three types of Agent: \n1. Direct Agents, who are very few. There is one in Europe, one in Asia, one in America, one \nin Africa - one in fact on almost every important continent. These Direct Agents receive \ninstructions directly from the Saheb-e-Zaman. \n2. Indirect Agents, who are few, and who receive instructions from the Direct Agents. \n3. Borrowed Agents, who are many, and who receive orders from the Indirect Agents. \nThe principal Agents are always on the fourth plane, and through the powers that they \nwield on this plane, they act for the Saheb-e-Zaman. They may even do miracles for the \nSaheb-e-Zaman, since the Saheb-e-Zaman himself almost never performs miracles. For if he \nwishes to do so, he must, at the time of doing the miracle, actually station himself on the \nfourth plane. These Agents are on the fourth plane only because of the necessity of using \ncertain of its powers for the work of the Saheb-e-Zaman. They are not in the position of \nthose on the spiritual Path, who when they reach the fourth plane may use its powers for \ngood, or may misuse them, and so fall back to a very primitive state of evolution. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1948, W p373 \n...Certain masts and certain salik-like pilgrims are known as spiritual chargemen... Such a \nman sees to the spiritual and material welfare of the place of which he is spiritual \nchargeman. The spiritual chargeman of a small place is a mast, but in a large place he is a \nsalik-like pilgrim, and in some centres of peculiar importance the chargemanship is in the \nhands of both a mast and a salik-like pilgrim. This system, whereby a mast or a salik-like \npilgrim is often the spiritual chargeman of a particular city or district, is peculiar to India, \nand in other countries there are spiritual Agents. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1948, W p37 \nPerfect Masters, who control and direct the spiritual and material welfare of the universe, \nusually do so through their Agents, who are scattered in different parts of the world, and \nwho hold different spiritual jurisdictions in accordance with their spiritual status. Some of \nthese Agents from the higher planes are vaguely conscious of the source of directions and \norders that they carry out. But the majority of those from the lower planes are unaware of \nthe source of directions and orders, which they implicitly and automatically carry out. \nSB p40 \nMuch of the work of the Divine Incarnation is often done through his Agents, who carry on \nthe duty entrusted to them by the Incarnation. The Agents may be on the Gross plane or on \nthe inner planes. If they do not have a Gross body, they are invisible to ordinary people. \nThey help people in their ascent through the planes. Some Agents fulfill the purpose of the \nDivine Incarnation unconsciously. They do not know consciously whence their impetus or \ninspiration comes. Other Agents consciously receive instructions from the Avatar and \nknowingly and voluntarily carry out these instructions. \n1956? Be p15 \nAbdals are those who change their forms, but appear at one place at a time. Abdals are \neither male or female in form. Very rarely you find an Abdal in a woman's form. If an Abdal \ndoes appear in a woman's form, she does not change to a male form, but always appears as \na woman, changing from one female to another depending upon what duty the Qutub \nassigns to her. She may appear as an old woman, a young woman, a smiling woman, a \nmiserable woman. An Abdal does important work, but mostly in the male form. If a male, he \ndoes not appear in a female form. The Avtad is always of a male form, and does odd jobs for \nthe Perfect Master. \n1965, Guruprasad, Poona, HM p461 \nAlso see Book Two: Agents \nAgents Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

This journey may be compared to a personal inspection tour of a state by a king to see \nhow his work is progressing at different places. When I was on a walk this evening, a man \non duty here gave up his charge to me in a very peculiar way. We saw a man who looked like \na sadhu, wearing only a langoti, coming straight toward us from the opposite direction. \nWhen he passed us, he gave me a flower, folded his hands to me, turned and walked straight \nback from where he had come. \n\"Neither while coming to us, nor while going away, did he look forward, backward or \nsideways, but he walked with his eyes straight ahead, without minding anything in the \nsurroundings. His eyes were very bright, like Ramakrishna's. \n\"It is such men who really know me. And they do their entrusted duties lovingly and \npleasingly. Such a life is worth living. On the other hand, there are hundreds who come to \nme with their hundreds of worldly problems. They do not really come to me, but keep their \ndistance by harboring their thousands of desires. \n\"It was quite a peculiar sight to see, as those who were with me will tell you; this thin, \nfeeble, crazy-looking sadhu coming straight ahead toward us, making a reverential bow, \nthen giving me a flower and walking straight back without so much as glancing sideways. It \nwas a sight. And more strange to see was that after the man disappeared, everyone who \nnoticed us, Hindu and Muslim alike, would also fold his hands to us...\" \nMeher Baba, \n18 July 1929, \nGuna, \nLM4 p1177 \n\"Every country has my Agents, and according to my wish, they work internally towards the \ngoal.\" \nMeher Baba, \n28 May 1930, \nMeherabad, \nLM4 p1315 \n\"... I am the emperor of the spiritual kingdom, and every second receive inner reports and \nmessages from my Agents in every corner of the world. Because of the troublesome times \nwe are facing, I am inwardly receiving only distressing reports, such as the conflict between \nChina and Japan. Such news pours in every moment from various parts of the world, and I \nhave to issue inner instructions to my Agents. \n\"You cannot see this outwardly, as I simultaneously manage an infinite number of things \ninwardly unknown to anyone. However, the effect of my work does appear outwardly. For \nexample, you may find me suddenly and quite abruptly in a bad mood. One moment I may \nlook happy in a jolly mood; the very next you may find me serious, irritable and morose. All \nthis depends on the reports I receive, and I have to plan my work according to them. \n\"Or suppose I am quite happily having tea, and at that moment I am inwardly informed that \nsomeone in India is passing through a great crisis. At that time, I send out a message in reply \non how to cope with or remedy the situation. And while doing that, my mood will change so \nthat I will appear absent from my present surroundings...\" \nMeher Baba, \n15 October 1930, \nMilan, Italy \nto Enid Corfe and Theo, \nLM4 p1458 \nWhen I work like this, a meeting of large numbers of my Agents is held, but you cannot see \nthem with your Gross eyes. Sometimes, though, you can hear a rumble like boot steps. \n12 July 1934, Fallenfluh, Switzerland, LM6 p1901 \nAn Agent near Mount Generoso, Switzerland (3 May 1932) \n\"Another interesting day was spent at Mount Generoso, on the snow, actually. From the \nheight we were able to look down on three lakes, Lugano, Como and Lucerne. A beautiful \nspot. We left by boat about 9 a.m. from our hotel, taking lunch with us. It was a perfect day. \nIt would seem to us that it was just by accident that we took that boat, but wait and see. It \nwas no accident, but fate! \n\"On a bench opposite us sat an old Swiss labourer, tall, well-built, homely, and  in \nworkman's clothes. He sat opposite Baba for about an hour. He left the boat at a little harbor \non the lake, en route. As he left the boat and on landing, he turned around and smiled at \nBaba, and then almost danced along the road. \n\"Later, Baba asked us if we had remarked anything about this man. Some said they had \nobserved how he kept looking at Baba and Baba at him, and that he tapped in a peculiar way \nwith his stick on the ground. Then Baba explained that this man was an Agent of his. Baba \nrepeated he had come here for a complete rest from work, and to do this he must hand over \nhis work temporarily to someone else; and this he had done this morning to the man we had \nseen, his Agent. They spoke to each other only by the tapping of the stick and a kind of \ninward recognition that was understood, and at that moment Baba raised this labourer \nfrom the second or third plane to the fourth or fifth. This was necessary or he could not \nhave taken over the work Baba was giving him to do.\" \nKitty Davy, \nAw 12:1 p 21-22 \nAnother version: LA p58 \n\"A borrowed Agent. Baba and his group were on a steamer on the lake of Lugano. There was \nan old man dressed in simple, poor clothes on the opposite side of the deck, whom Baba \npointed out as one of his Agents. One of the group asked how he should know this. Baba \nthen took Dr. Ghani's walking stick and asked those about him if they would believe him \nshould the old man tap his stick in the same way that Baba tapped Dr. Ghani's stick. \n\"Baba then tapped Dr. Ghani's stick two or three times on the deck in a special way, and the \nold man, though he was not looking at Baba at the time, tapped his stick in exactly the same \nway. Baba then tapped again in a different way, and the old man again copied his taps \nexactly. This was done finally a third time, and again repeated exactly. Baba later sent \nsomeone to him with a piece of bread and butter, which he ate.\" \nWilliam Donkin, Wa p374 \n\"He was my Agent. I have come here for complete rest, and in order to do that, I must \ntemporarily hand over the work to someone else. This morning I have done that with this \nman. I had to raise him from between the second and third plane, to between the fourth and \nfifth, so that he could take on the work I am giving him. \n\"The transfer of my work must take place either in a thick jungle, on a high mountain, on \nwater, or in a crowd. That is why he smiled, looked at me, and went off. You should have \nnoticed how he answered my taps with his stick on the boat, by giving properly timed taps \nwith his stick in reply to mine. \n\"This Agent of mine is married, but none of his family has any idea of his spiritual status. \nThere are very few adepts - those between the third and sixth plane - in Europe. There is \nonly one on the seventh plane; he is one of the 56 God-conscious souls on earth. There is \nalso one person of the sixth plane in Europe. These adepts are still nothing compared to my \nCircle members. Those of my Circle will all be of the seventh plane. They have been doing \nmy dictates for ages...\" \nMeher Baba, 3 May 1932, \nMount Generoso, Switzerland, \nLM5 p1601-1603 \nAn Agent at Harvan, Kashmir (20 April 1933) \n\"It was while returning from Harvan that a man, close-shaven, small in stature and very \nscantily clad, rushed out from the side path and started running after our tonga (horse-\ndrawn carriage), singing and dancing in high glee. To all appearances he seemed a harmless \nmadman, and was taken as such by all the neighborhood, especially attracting the delighted \nchildren. This man recognised Baba, hence his ecstatic behavior. Baba smiled at him. I recall \nhe restrained one of us from giving him money, and warned us not to laugh at what seemed \nstrange behavior. \n\"Later Baba told us he was a borrowed Agent of his in Kashmir, and that he had to appear \nmad in order to carry on his spiritual work. Baba also said that there were three other \nAgents in Kashmir, all old men, and not of the mad type.\" \nKitty Davy, LA p99 \n\"Returning from Harwan, the bus stopped at Shalimar Gate. Boys rushed to ask us for \nbaksheesh.* Also there came a man with closely shaven head, small in stature, who danced \naround as if he were mad. Baba restrained one of the girls from giving him money. Later he \ntold us that he was one of his four Agents in Kashmir, and he appeared mad so that he could \ncarry on his work. He was the type of Agent that could disappear and appear in another \nplace miles away at will, an Abdal. There are three other Agents in Kashmir, all old men, and \nnot of the mad type.\" \nElizabeth Patterson, \nHM p459 \n*baksheesh = alms \n\"When they were passing the gate of the famous Shalimar Gardens on their way back from \nHarvan, they noticed a short, thin man with a closely-shaven head. His face was the epitome \nof a grimace, and he was playing the giddy-goat with a crowd of children, who were \nenjoying his fun immensely. He came up to Baba, stretching out his hands and laughing, and \nBaba smiled at him and made gestures back at him. Baba later explained that he was a \nborrowed Agent, who had the capacity to project his body to any place, i.e. he was an Abdal, \nand that he specially worked amongst children and young people.\" \nWilliam Donkin, \nWa p273-274 \n\"As they were returning from Harvan, a short, scantily clad man rushed out singing and \ndancing from a side path and began to run after their car. Baba smiled at him. One of the \nwomen wished to give him money, but Baba restrained her. He warned them, 'Do not laugh \nat what seems to be strange behavior. He is not mad.' Baba later informed the group, 'He is a \nborrowed Agent who has to appear mad in order to carry out his spiritual work. There are \nthree other Agents in Kashmir, all old men, and not the mad type.\"' \nBhau Kalchuri, \nLM5 p1770 \nAn Agent in Rome (7 July 1933) \n\"Baba said that he had important work to do in Rome... He told us that among the thousands \nof spiritual Agents in the world, there are four who are concerned with the destinies of \ncontinents and races... Under them are many subordinates on the first through fourth \nplanes; some are conscious and some are unconscious of their spiritual functions. They \ncarry out the tasks allotted to them, and it is only those on the lowest planes who directly \naffect the visible universe. \n\"The European Agent lives in Rome; outwardly he lives a normal life - he is married, and \nnone could guess his great spiritual position. Baba said that a necessary preliminary to his \nworld manifestation was that he should meet in the physical body these four chief Agents... \n\"That afternoon Baba went to a famous cafe, Aragno al Corso. It is the central point of Rome \nand much traffic passes by. Baba watched the people and the cars and talked with Minta and \nNorina who were sitting on either side of him. Suddenly he was 'absent' but some of the \nparty did not recognise the change and continued to chatter to him. Afterwards he told us \nthat the chief Agent had passed by in an automobile, the meeting had taken place - no \nfurther or closer contact was necessary. Several individuals stared at Baba while we were \nseated at the cafe.\" \nHerbert Davy, \nLA p103 \n\"That afternoon, after seeing some visitors, Baba went to a famous cafe - Aragno al Corso - \nwhere for centuries politicians and men of affairs were accustomed to sit and talk. It is the \ncentral point of Rome and much traffic passes by. Our tables were on the pavement, we ate \nrolls, cakes and lemon-water ices. Baba watched the people and the cars, and talked with M. \nand N. who were sitting on either side of him. Suddenly he was absent, the balloon had \nsoared into the air. Some of the party did not recognise the change, and continued to chatter \nto him. Several people stared at Baba while we were seated at the cafe.\" \nHerbert Davy? \nPM p209 \n\"After the interview, Baba and the group went to the Aragno al Corso, a famous cafe and \nwell-known gathering place where politicians and persons in various walks of life sit and \ndiscuss the issues of the day over cups of espresso. The cafe is located in the very busy \ncenter of Rome. They sat down at the sidewalk tables and ordered sweet rolls, cakes and \nlemon ices. Baba watched as the crowds and traffic passed by, gesturing with Minta and \nNorina sitting at his side. As they sat there enjoying themselves, a heavy middle-aged man \nwith blond hair drove by them very slowly in a red Fiat sportscar convertible. \n\"Baba later explained that this was his direct Agent in Europe, referring to him as \n'Christiano.' Baba remarked that the indirect Agent whom Herbert had contacted in Warsaw \ntook orders from Christiano, who lived in Rome with his wife, but she knew nothing of his \nspiritual status. Suddenly, Baba was absent from them, and they all turned toward him and \nsat still. His eyelids flickered open after awhile and he stood up, indicating that it was time \nto leave.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, \nLM5 p1785 \n\"He is the direct Agent for Europe. Baba and a group of his disciples were in the Aragno al \nCorso. This man drove very slowly past  in a Fiat car, driving the car himself. He was a \nfattish, middle-aged, blonde-headed man, looking apparently a typical inconspicuous \nbourgeois citizen. Baba explained that he lived in Rome and had a wife who knew nothing of \nhis spiritual status. Baba calls this direct Agent for Europe 'Christiano.\"' \nWilliam Donkin, \nWa p374 \nAn Agent at Albuquerque, N. Mexico (17 Dec. 1934) \n\"The train to California makes one stop of one-half hour at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Baba \ngot off the train and walked up and down the long brick platform. I was with him. He wrote \nsomething on the palm of his hand - 'Indian.' \n\"I thought, what shall I do? Baba wants to see some Indians, and where shall I find any? I \npointed to an old squaw sitting in front of one of the shops that border the station. Baba \nmotioned to his four Indian disciples, pulled my arm through his, and off we went toward \nthe end of the long station platform. He turned abruptly and continued up a street as if he \nknew exactly where he was going. \n\"At that time I had not arrived at the state of mind which leaves everything to Baba. I was \nstill thinking of myself, and I thought, my, we have only half an hour here, and where is Baba \ngoing, hunting for Indians, we may miss the train... \n\"Baba, of course, knew what I was thinking. After walking about two blocks, I saw two \nIndians standing at the corner. One was very tall and fat, dressed in shirt and trousers and a \nband of red tied around his forehead. The other one was short and was selling small bows \nand arrows. I was delighted and I said to Baba, 'Here are two Indians.' \n\"The small Indian walked away, and Baba stood before the tall one, and they looked at each \nother. I murmured something about wondering whether he spoke English, but no one paid \nany attention to me. The Indian disciples said nothing, and in the back of my head I was \nthinking about the train. Suddenly Baba turned abruptly, again put my arm through his, and \nwe returned to the train just in time. The whole thing was so strange that I asked Baba if he \nknew that the Indian would be there, and Baba nodded yes - and on his board he said, 'One \nof my Agents.\"' \nRuano Bogislav, \nAw 3:3 p3-4, also HM p729 \n\"Baba has explained that this is one of the very rare direct Agents; he is the direct Agent for \nAmerica. In 1934, when Baba and a few of his disciples were on their way to California, the \ntrain stopped at Albuquerque for a short time. Baba spelt out the word 'Indian' on the palm \nof his hand, and went with Ruano away from the station into a small street nearby. At a \nstreet corner they noticed two American Indians; one was selling bows and arrows, and he \nwalked away as soon as Baba approached. The other, a tall, impressive figure with a red \nband tied round his head, stayed where he was, and for a few moments Baba and he stood \nfacing one another, each looking intently into the other's eyes. Baba then abruptly walked \nback to the station.\" \nWilliam Donkin, \nWa p373 \n\"Once on the train, Ruano narrated the incident to the others, and Baba commented about \nthe Indian, 'He is one of my Agents. He is the direct Agent in charge of America.' Baba later \nexplained that he was an Agent of the fourth plane - one of four in the world with \nmiraculous powers.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, \nLM6 p1934 \nAbout Baba's explanation of 20 April 1933 in the chapter AGENTS: \nDescent means descent from the infinite into the finite, when the soul descends \nunconsciously through the Mental and Subtle worlds, eventually reaching the physical. \nAscent is the soul's return to the infinite back through the Subtle and Mental worlds, this \ntime consciously. These explanations were accompanied by a diagram, which is printed in \nHM p459. \nFor more about Agents, see Wa p373-375, and HM p458-463, 728-732. \nAgents Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

The Hindus call God Deva, and his 330 million powers \nare called Devas - Angels. \n17 October 1922, Bombay, LM2 p450 \nOther versions: SW p114, RD p113 \nAngels have love, but it is not in its divine aspect, and so they cannot realise Paramatman. \nRightly has it been said, \nQoodsinyara  ishq hasto dard  neest. \ni.e. Angels have love, but no pain or restlessness of the divine love. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before March 1929 \nMs 1:3 (March 1929) p9 \nMeher Baba asked Ramjoo Abdulla if he was a human being or an animal. Ramjoo replied, 'A \nhuman being!' \nBaba: The human form is the last form in evolution, and it is the highest. Although it is the \nlast and highest form in creation, it is still full of animal desires and lower qualities, such as \neating, drinking, envy, hatred, anger and lust. These blemishes are there because the human \nform has evolved through and out of creation, and in this evolving, all the faults and defects \nthat are in animals are also in the human being. \nBut this is not the whole view. Side by side with these lower qualities, the human being has \ncreated in himself certain higher Angelic qualities -- such as being able to free himself from \nbase desires -- and has the attributes of kindness and grace. In an ordinary human being, \nthere is an admixture of almost half and half of the lower animal qualities and the higher \nAngelic ones. Eventually the Angelic qualities are also destroyed, and man becomes one \nwith God. \nTo be a human being does not only mean to be born in a human form with the lowest animal \nqualities still attributed to it. A human form with the animal qualities destroyed and the \nAngelic qualities developed is a real human being. But even that is not a perfect state. \nAngelic qualities developed to the highest degree still do not make a Perfect being. The \nAngels are free from the lower animal qualities, and possess higher qualities of godliness, \nbut they have no love -- longing -- real love for God, which makes one worthy of union. \nAngels, of course, have love, but it is in their nature, essence. They have what can be called \nnatural love, which makes Angels higher than human beings. But being devoid of love for \nGod, Angels cannot realise God. For that, they must assume human form with these higher \nqualities developed. In human form alone can they create love for God, qualifying them for \nthe attainment of God-realisation. Realisation of God can never be attained without the \nhuman form. Angels must assume one human birth to realise God. \nNow tell me whether you are a man or an animal. \nRamjoo: It seems that I am part man and part beast. But I do not understand what the \nnatural love of Angels is. \nBaba: Look how a mother loves her child. She does not have to cultivate her love. This \nfeeling of hers just happens, and is natural, but it is not love for God. The same is inborn in \nAngels. Being innate, that is why it is called natural love. \n4 August 1929, Harvan, Kashmir, LM4 p1189 \nThere is an ocean of infinity in God. In this ocean there are waves which produce the \ncreation of drops. The drops in the waves, which were created in the beginning with the \nwhim in the infinite ocean, do not pass through the seven stages of evolution as others do, \nbut immediately assume the form of Angels instead. \nThese Angels are in the same state for cycles and cycles, for eons and eons. They have Subtle \nforms and are in the second heaven in the third Subtle plane. They unconsciously thirst for a \nhuman form, even though they are in the highest state of happiness. \nBut this bliss is of no use to them without full consciousness. It rarely happens, but after \nmillions and millions of years, one Angel is born as a human being in order to realise its real \nself. Why? In order to gain consciousness, which up to now it lacked, though it has passed \nnumerous years in the Subtle world as an Angel. \nAfter an Angel is born as a human being, it does not have to pass through human \nreincarnation, but becomes Realised in that very first human birth. These Angels are not \nborn on the Gross plane together, but one at a time. Therefore, from a spiritual point of \nview, man is far superior to Angels, because the Angels, in spite of enjoying millions of years \nof bliss in heaven, have to take human form before attaining Liberation. \n7 July 1930, Meherabad. LM4 p1325 \nAn Angel is a spark which has become separated from the flame (God) and will have to go \nthrough the process of reincarnation. An Angel does not begin as an atom, but reincarnates \ndirectly as man. Only man can become God-realised. \n1933, Muree,  Kashmir, LA p96 \nThe Agents without form have no connection with other Agents, because they have not \nundergone the process of evolution. But they are powerful. \nThey have no mind, no desire, no form, but they are spirits, and exist, and are like sparks. \nOne who gets Illumination can see them, even with their eyes. Here, now, are so many. \nThey have no mind, yet can hear and see, because they feel. What they do is whatever they \nsee and hear. Through feeling they pass it on to the unconscious ocean. What they report \ncomes up to the point of creation, the point after ascent. So that message goes to the Perfect \nMasters. Everything these millions of Agents see or hear goes to the Perfect Masters. \n20 April 1933, Kashmir, HM p460 \nThe Subtle world represents desires, ego and energy. The Subtle bodies on this plane have \nforms of light (Tej or Noor) known as Angels. The light-form of these Angels or spirits can \nwith no stretch of imagination be compared to the sun, which can be said to be the shadow \nof this light... The Angels or spirits... are all evolved beings... \n1930s, Aw 15:3&4 p62 \nThere are two aspects of human nature, one pertaining to the Angels, and the other to the \nanimals; the former relying on the soul, and the latter on the flesh. \nbefore 1948, from notes dictated \nby Meher Baba, ST p113 \nLife often presents engimas which cannot be unraveled by ordinary persons. It seems to \nthem to be full of questions which are unanswerable. Unrestrained chaos seems to be the \nlaw of the world, and there appears to be no justice or significance in the march of its \nevents. Even those who believe in God get puzzled, and waver in their faith. \nBut it is only impatience and lack of true vision that are responsible for such an outlook. We \nembrace ignorance, and we fail to see that whatever life brings is charged with great \nmeaning. God's ways are always unchallengable and irresistable, thought they might be \nmysterious and inscrutable. The secrets of his working in the world cannot be truly \nunderstood even by advanced souls. \nThis may be brought out by means of an anecdote of a great saint who is very much \nrespected up to this day in all quarters of the world. \nOnce upon a time this saint encountered an Angel, and requested him for being allowed to \nbe with him in his wanderings on Earth, so that he might understand something of the \nsecret working of God. \nThe Angel at once granted him permission to be with him and observe all his doings on \nEarth. But he laid down his strict condition in the following words. He said, \n'You are only to observe my doings, without at any stage and in any way asking me the \nexplanation for my actions. You would not be able to judge and understand God's ways. \nEven if you are not able to understand them, you must not ask me the why of all that you see \nme do, during the period that you will be allowed to be with me.' \nThe saint promised that he would merely observe, and that he would in no way pester him \nwith any questions, even if such questions arose in his mind. And then he was allowed to \nfollow the Angel in his wanderings on Earth. \nOnce they got into a boat for crossing the sea. The boatman offered his services to them \nwithout charging his usual fare, just because it pleased him to help them. When the boat \nwas in the midst of the ocean, the Angel took off one side-plank from the framework of the \nboat and threw it away in the water. \nThe saint at once got worried, and exclaimed, \n'Why are you damaging the boat? Shall we not all get drowned, along with the boat?' \nThe Angel reminded him that he had already agreed not to ask him any questions \nwhatsoever, and asked him to remain quiet. \nAfter landing they came upon an Arab youth. To the utter bewilderment of that saint, the \nAngel at once killed that youth on the very spot. Now the saint found it very difficult to \nremain quiet, but asked him in excitement, 'Why did you kill that growing life?' \nOn this, the Angel replied, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to understand God's \nworking? You must keep to your promise that you will not ask any questions' \nThe saint realised that he had failed in fulfilling the condition which he had accepted, and he \nwanted to be excused. \nThen they both came to a village, where they requested the people of the village to give \nthem some food. But the villagers only treated them contemptuously, and drove them away \nwithout giving them alms. \nWhen they came to the outskirts of the village, they saw a dilapidated wall in ruins, which \nwas intended to protect the village from the invasions of enemies. The Angel went to the \nwall and repaired it, spending much of his valuable time. \nThis time, the saint could not contain himself and said, 'Why did you repair that wall for the \nvillagers, who did not even give alms to us? You have done this labor of love for nothing. For \nso much labor in the village, we would easily have got sufficient remuneration to procure \nfood and allay our hunger.' \nAt this, the Angel said, 'You have again asked a question, in spite of your having promised \nmerely to observe and keep quiet. It is no use divulging the secrets of God's ways \nprematurely. It requires the greatness and patience of God to understand his working. You \nhave tried to pry into God's secrets, which you must not divulge. It is now time for us to \npart. But never mind, before we part, I will explain to you the reasons for my deeds.' \nThe Angel then proceeded to give the explanation to the saint. He said, 'The boatman is a \npoor but pious man. When I took away a side-plank of the boat from a prominent place in its \nframework, I knew that a king of robbers was approaching in that direction. This robber-\nking was collecting new and efficient boats to carry on his plunders. And whenever he saw \nany really good boat, he was sure to snatch it away from the owners. He, however, left \nuntouched any boats which were in a broken and dilapidated condition. I took away a huge \nside-plank in order that a the boat might look uninviting. Otherwise the pious and poor \nboatman will be relieved of the only means of his livelihood. \n'Now, the Arab youth whom I killed was most notorious and vicious. If he had lived, he \nwould not only have perpetrated heinous crimes, but would surely have brought upon his \npious parents an agonising blasphemy which they in no way merited. It was the will of \ndivine providence that I should kill this Arab youth in order to save him from further sins, \nand save his pious parents from the suffering of undeserved ill-fame. \n'Now coming to the repairs of the wall. Be it known to you that one pious man has kept \nburied under it his valuable treasure, with a desire that it may be of use to his sons. But it is \nGod's will that his sons must get that treasure when they grow up, and that no one else \nshould get it. If the dilapidated wall had further fallen, the treasure was in danger of being \nexposed to the sight of the wicked villagers, who would surely have taken possession of that \ntreasure for themselves. \n'Rest assured that all I did in the incidents which it was your special privilege to observe, I \ndid, not of my own accord or initiative, but by the orders of our divine father, whose real \ngreatness even we as Angels can only partly understand. God's ways might be inscrutable to \nthe world. But his love for the world is unbounded, and his justice is unfailing.' \nWith these words the Angel parted, leaving the saint in deep contemplation. And the saint \ndecided to live in complete resignation, to accept God's will even when his limited intellect \ncould not understand its real meaning. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \nbefore 1948, ST p61-65 \nEven Angels do not have this love for God. If they want to be Realised, they have first to \nbecome human. When a person becomes God-realised, he drops the body in one to three \ndays.' \nJuly 1952,  Manhattan, LM11 p3878 \nThe Angels (unembodied souls) are mere automatons for the will of God, and they do \nnothing which is not desired or prompted by God. These wishes happen to be mere \nexpressions of divine power and activity which are all-pervading. In short, Angels are pure, \nand not contaminated with physical embodiment. In this they are superior to the man \nwhose consciousness has not extended beyond the limitations of the Gross (meaning a man \nnot yet on the Path). \nParadoxically, man, the inferior, who has succeeded in being contaminated with physical \nembodiment, is actually the superior in the strength of the potentialities latent within him. \nExperiencing his imperfections, limitations and weaknesses, he is potentially ripe to realise \nhis real strength and purity, which are far above those of, and beyond the reach of, even the \nArchangels... \nMan has and man shall (because man alone can) jump over the last seven links of the really \nnon-existent relative existences of all the four spheres into his really own - the fifth, the Real \nsphere. In short, Angels must necessarily cease to be Angels and become man before they \ncan reach the reality attainable to man. And when man ceases to be man and enters the I am \nGod state, he realises that Angels and Archangels are, in fact, his own attributes in one sense \nor another. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, GS p247-248 \nHerein (in the Subtle world) the relationship between God and his manifested attributes is \nof the sort that exists between father and children. Here God is kind, merciful and vigilant \ntowards his children, who are carefree, with no thoughts of punishment or reward, no \ndesire for knowledge, and no craving for spiritual attainments. And such entities are \ncommonly known as Angels... \nThe entities of this world are exclusively busy with their appointed task of remembering \nGod. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, GS p285 \nEven the evolution of Angels and Archangels, with all of their hierarchy, is not to be \nregarded as an exclusive stream in advancing life. They can incarnate among the human \nbeings and become linked up with the human stream of life. They are also subject to the \nlaws of cycles, and all that happens to them is subject to the control of Perfect Masters. \n1956? Be p24 \nSome drop-bubbles remain latent in the six states of the oceanic stir. They remain \nstationary in the Mental or Subtle planes with only bubbles of mind, or bubbles of energy. \nSuch drop-souls with only bubbles of mind are called Archangels, and they exist in the \nMental world. Drop-souls with only bubbles of energy are called Angels, and they exist in \nthe third Subtle plane. Archangels have a Mental body, but no Gross form. They have Mental \nconsciousness without sanskaras. Angels have a Subtle body, but no Gross form. They have \nSubtle consciousness without sanskaras. \nAll other drop-bubbles which come out of the Nothing pass into the seventh state of \nmovement, the Gross world, to journey through evolution, reincarnation and involution. \nThis journey has a purpose - it ends in an answer. The purpose is to attain Everything, and \nthe answer is 'I am God' to Everything's question 'Who am I?' \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \n1968, Meherazad, NE p37 \nThe third heaven, Alm-e-Kudasi, the Pure World, is divided into three sections or parts: \nThe first section is the state of Indra, in Sanskrit Indraloke, the abode of the rain god to \nHindus, and in Persian Makan-e-Hoori, the house of the faeries. \nThe second section is the abode of the Angels or the abode of the gods, in Sanskrit Devaloke. \nThe Greek and Roman gods were these Angels or Devas, and they are the Hindu gods. \nThe third section is the actual section of Alm-e-Kudasi where the pilgrim experiences Subtle \nknowledge. This knowledge is not Gnosis, but occult or mystic knowledge. \nEach section in the third heaven holds millions of times more bliss, more happiness, more \npowers than the second heaven. \nThe state of Subtle consciousness known as Indra is the state of the first section of the third \nheaven. Indra is known as the king of the gods or the king of the Angels, the same as the \nGreek Zeus or the Roman Jupiter. In Persian, Indra's abode is Makan-e-Hoori, the House of \nFaeries or the House of Beautiful Women. Indra's faeries are feminine Subtle beings, a type \nof Angel with exceptional beauty and charm. \nThe state of Indra is referred to as a post of divinity, a station of considerable power and \ncertain duties concerning the elements of nature, specifically to do with Earth. \nIf a man successfully performs a severe penance such as Chilla Nashini, staying inside a \ncircle for forty days and nights, when he drops his physical body (dies), this man attains the \nIndra state. This means that a Gross-conscious man becomes Indra, and gains that Subtle \nidentity with the status (king), the powers, the duties of that post (throne). He has become \nthe king of the gods (Zeus, Jupiter) who rules 330 million Angels. \nBeing king of the Angels is an experience of Alm-e-Kudasi which is millions of times more \nblissful than any experience in the second heaven of Alm-e-Ruhani. Through his Subtle body \nhe consciously experiences the bliss of being deified, and holds that post while in a \ndisembodied state. \nFor one Epoch, which equals four Cycles (each Cycle is about 26,000 years), this human \nholds the post of Indra, and is very possessive of it. Many times those men (ascetics) in the \nGross world who are striving to attain the post of Indra will have their penance disturbed by \nthe individual currently holding the throne. The suffering penitents are actually disturbed \nby Indra himself, who sends all kinds of temptations their way, from the most frightful to \nthe most seductive, to defeat the penance and have it stopped. Those who fail to dethrone \nIndra are overcome by their own fear during the penance. \nIndra will do anything to keep his throne, but despite efforts to stay in power, the individual \nholding the Indra post must leave it after one Epoch, and again take a human body on earth. \nThat individual who was Indra progresses higher while incarnate, still retaining his third \nplane Subtle consciousness. It is important to understand that this individual titled Indra \nexists in his Subtle body and inhabits the heavens while disembodied, but cannot progress \nin Subtle consciousness until he incarnates again. In other words, Zeus must come down \nfrom Olympus, Jupiter must abandon the abode of the gods and become a man again to \nadvance higher toward the fourth plane. \nThere are 558 human beings on the third plane as saliks, and even more as masts are \nabsorbed in the heavens, but only one holds the post of Indra. \nThe Angels are the ancient gods of mythology. Indra controls the Angels and assigns duties \nto them, making certain that each Angel fulfills its duty in the proper way for the balance of \nnature in creation. Angels inhabit the second section of the third heaven, Devaloke. Angels \nare the Devas, who have only Subtle form and no Gross body. A pilgrim with third plane \nconsciousness can see these Angels as a normal man sees Gross creatures. Angels do not \npass through evolution in the Gross world. \nAngels are those drop-bubbles who remained stationary in the Subtle world during the first \nsix stages of movement in the  ocean of Nothing, and never reached the seventh stage, the \nGross world. When the drop-bubbles first entered creation through the Mental planes \nunconsciously, some became Archangels that exist in the sixth heaven. Those who became \nAngels continued to pass through the Mental planes, but attained consciousness when they \nentered the third plane's second heaven, the Angelic abode Devaloke, or the first heaven \nMakan-e-Hoori, and became Faeries. \nThough completely happy and enjoying bliss to the fullest as automatons of the will of \nIndra, Angels still aspire to attain human form, because only in human form can a soul \nbecome God-realised. God-realisation is the divine goal of all life, not Angelic existence or \nbeing a god among gods. So the Angels and Archangels must attain a human form, as also \nIndra must leave his throne and give up his reign to progress further toward Godhood. After \nan Angel has existed in Devaloke for four cycles (a cycle is about 26,000 years), the Angel \nhas the opportunity of being born in human form. \nAfter only one birth and lifetime as a human being, that Archangel or Angel receives \nLiberation from all future births and deaths - Mukti, the state of infinite bliss realised. \nThe universe, though huge, immeasurably vast and of countless variety, is a closed system, \nand a balance of nature must be maintained within this universal container (Universal \nBody). The universal container holds all light, all heat, all sound, all water, all the elements \ncontained in nature and the natural forces (energies) generated in the universe. It is the \nwork of the Angels and Faeries (various types called genii, or jinni, or sylphs, etc.) under the \ndirection of Indra, to keep light, heat, sound, water, and the elemental forces of nature in \nequilibrium. Without the Angels and Faeries, there would be frequent colossal disturbances \nin the universe as a result of the imbalance of these elements and energies, for the human \nmind plays havoc with the natural forces through scientific exploitation. \nIt is only after many years that the natural forces go out of control. During such eruption in \nthe universe, resulting as chaos in the world - earthquakes, floods, famines, etc. - not even \nthe Angels and Faeries nor Indra can control the cosmic consequences. These cosmic \nconsequences are universal disharmony caused by human extravagance and excessiveness. \nThen the Ancient one himself must come into creation and work to restore equilibrium in \nthe universe. \nIndra has control of all the 330 million gods or Angels. Each Angel performs a different \nfunction under Indra's reign. Some control the winds, temperature, the seas, or evolving \nforms. Some Faeries are connected with metals, vegetation, worms, insects, fish, birds or \nanimals. The 330 million Angels in Devaloke perform specific functions for the maintenance \nor preservation of the universe. According to the specific duty assigned them by Indra, each \nAngel is called a god of this power or that power (as it is said Neptune rules the seas)... \nIndra and the Angels do not advance through the third Subtle plane, because neither have \nGross bodies, and one needs a Gross human body to advance. Indra and his Angels remain \nstationary in the first and second sections of Alm-e-Kudasi, namely in Makan-e-Hoori and \nDevaloke. However, the third plane pilgrim advancing through the third section of Alm-e-\nKudasi has a physical human body as well as a Subtle and Mental body, and so he can \nadvance. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1967? \nNE p79-81 \nAngels Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved. Email mehersthan at gmail.com \nAnimals 1 \nAnimals 1 \nANGELS \nBook Two \nAbout the story in Book One: Angels, dated 'before 1948' from ST: \nAnother version of this story is told in the Koran (18: 69-82) about Moses. In N. J. Dawood's \ntranslation, published by Penguin books, it appears on pages 96-98, in the chapter he titled \n'The Cave.' The Angel in Meher Baba's version of the story is called 'one of our servants to \nwhom we had vouchsafed our mercy and whom we had endowed with knowledge of our \nown.' in Dawood's translation of the Koran. The 'our 'and 'we' signify Allah, who, it was \nbellieved, spoke to Muhammad through the heavenly messenger Jibraeel. Meher Baba \nconfirmed that Jibraeel (Gabriel) did teach Muhammad. \n\"The Masters have sometimes followed external disciplines, including prayers, and have set \nan example of humility  and readiness to learn from others. Thus Muhammad played the \nrole of being taught by Gabriel. He thereby achieved two things. Firstly, he gave the world \nan example of readiness to learn from others. And secondly, he awakened the teacher in \nGabriel.\" \nMeher Baba, \n1955? Be p74 \nIn yet another version of the story, told by the Perfect Master Jelal al din Rumi, the 'Angel' is \nidentified as Khwaja Khizr, who in Sufi tradition was the Master of Moses. \nMeher Baba explained that Khwaja Khizr is a Perfect Master who takes temporary human \nform whenever needed, and that Khizr was the Master of Francis of Assisi (Aw 4:3 p34). \nAccording to Bhau Kalchuri, Khwaja Khizr was the Master of Narayan Maharaj (LM1 p31 fn). \nMeher Baba explained about the poet John Milton: \n\"Milton was spiritually advanced, but did not attain beyond the second plane in the Subtle \nworld. He could see heaven and hell, and that was how he was able to write Paradise Lost \nand Paradise Regained. His books about heaven and hell depict the result of his personally \nseeing them.\" \n3 November 1927, \nMeherabad, LM3 p970 \nMeher Baba said in July, 1952 in  New York, that one of his followers, Ella Winterfeldt, had \nbeen an Angel before taking human form: \n\"My dear Angel Ella came down to be with me.\" \nsource: Ella Winterfeldt \nAnother version: \n\"I am happy that my Angel has come down with me this time.\" \nAw 21:2:12 \nA third version: \n'Ella is an Angel. Even Angels do not have this love for God. If they want to be Realised, they \nhave first to become human. When a person becomes God-realised, he drops the body in \none to three days.' \nLM11 p3878 \nFor more about the Angels and Indra, see NE p77-81. \nAlso see 'Archangels' \nAngels Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

The wounded \nmen were brought to Meherabad hospital. Baba said to his men Mandali: \n\"... Do you feel anything while killing an ant, gnat or mosquito? Not a bit. Do you feel badly \nwhen a hen's neck is being cruelly wrung by a butcher? No. Then why feel and shiver at this \nhuman murder, the wounds, the blood, the pain? The ant, fly, hen and goat all have lives as \nhumans have. Why feel for one and not the other?\" \n20 July 1926, Meherabad, LM3 p828 \nAfter a person dies, many people perform rites and ceremonies for a long time. But all these \nare useless. No ritual is necessary after ten days. \nHowever, the best rites would be to feed either dogs or crows near the body, because they \nhave Subtle sight and can see the spirit of the dead person. Crows and dogs are not Subtle-\nconscious, but they have Subtle faculties of perception, and draw towards themselves the \nsanskaras of dead people.\" \n22 September 1926, Meherabad, LM3 p848 \nIt is said that the chief complaint of the Hindus is the Moslems' killing of cows. It is wrong \nfor the Hindus to do so. If they protest on economic and humanitarian grounds against cow-\nkilling, then why do they restrict themselves only to cows. Why don't they feel equal mercy \nfor other animals that are being slaughtered? \nBut the real question is not one of mercy, for an animal gets evolutionary advancement \nwhen it is killed. It is that the progress of one who kills gets retarded, and he has to suffer \nmuch. It is the man who kills the animal who is to be pitied, not the animal that is killed. \nJuly 1927, Meherabad, SW p400 \nIt is not so much the innocent animals that are killed, but those wretched persons who kill \nthem that deserve to be pitied. For the persons who kill innocent animals like lambs and \ncows have to suffer terribly, not only in their present, but also in their several future lives. \n29 March 1929, Meherabad \nMs 1:5 p26 (May 1929) \nUnless a snake is killed by a human being, it remains always a snake. Never leave a snake \nwounded, as it takes so long to die. Once wounded, a snake will always remain near you to \nbe killed outright. \n28 March 1938, Panchgani, \nIndia, LM7 p2269 \nIn evolution, the snake form is like an entangled rope which you cannot undo or unwind. \nHowever, if it is killed by a human being the knot untangles itself, and the soul is free to \ncontinue on its way through evolution. \nundated, to Padri, LM7 p2269 \nIf you are a perfect follower of nonviolence - you give an oath that you would not hurt \nanything - and if you saw one dog killing three cats, what would you do? Kill the dog? If you \nstood aside, you would kill the three cats. \nWhat,  Elizabeth, what would you do? If you keep silent, you are helping to kill the three \ncats. If you kill the dog, you are violent. \nThere is a tiger amongst a herd of cattle, and you have a gun in your house that you do not \ntouch because of your oath of nonviolence. You know you can kill the tiger and save the \nherd. What would you do? \nKill the tiger, detached. This is what Krishna teaches: do not follow violence or nonviolence, \njust be detached. You must kill for the good of the herd. \nJune? 1939, Meherabad, \nLA p277 (also LM7 p2434) \nDuring the process of evolution of forms and consciousness, there are seven turns until the \nhuman form develops. Now, every turn has a direct connection with God... \nIn the animal kingdom, a dog is on the turning, as it has intuition and also partial insight, \nwithout being able to use it consciously. \nSaints of the fifth and sixth plane have insight, and they use it. But the dog cannot use it. The \ndog only sees things that ordinary human beings cannot. The dog's company purifies \nthoughts and atmosphere. That is why Zoroastrians have the custom of bringing a dog to \nsee the corpse when someone is dead before disposal of the body. The dog purifies the \nsanskaras. \nDogs play an important part when used consciously by a Master... \nWhen Masters touch the dead bodies of animals, the animals get human forms in their next \nlives. Those animals who are in contact with Masters get forms of spiritual souls in the next \nbirth... \n29 September 1940, Meherabad \nLM7 p2618-2619 \nDon't kill lizards. Any animal that directly injures should be killed, but not lizards. Catch \nthem and throw them outside. They eat flies and are useful. \nIf you kill them, you will be a lizard in your next birth. \n17 November 1940, Kandy, Ceylon \nto Dowla and Katie, LM7 p2641 \nSuppose a mad dog has run amuck, and is likely to bite school children, and the teachers in \nthe school destroy the mad dog in order to protect the children. This destruction of the mad \ndog does imply violence, but there is no hatred in it... \nIt is justified because there is no hatred in it, and because it is intended to promote the \ngreater good of the children, who would be attacked by the mad dog. \nMarch 1942, Me p41, 48. Also LM8 p2779, 2782 \nKilling an animal for sport, pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since \nthe motive is selfish. But no such bad impressions are caught from snakes or germs and the \nlike, which are a danger to humanity, when they are killed out of philanthropic motives and \nonly when absolutely necessary. Such killing, when it is not a duty, will certainly create \nbinding impressions... \nImpressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because \ntherein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more \nsusceptible to lust and anger. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba \nbefore 1948, ST p26 \nANIMALS \nBook Two \n\"... There is in the heart of divinity a thought for all that breathes -- bird, animal or man. \nBeloved Baba, in his impersonal aspect, is concerned not only with the well-being of man, \nbut also with that of all other forms of life. According to him, all animals, and even plants \nand trees, are an inalienable part of the larger brotherhood to which we all belong. As a \nnatural corollary of this, we have to be affectionate and considerate toward birds, animals, \netc., not out of any sense of duty or even obligation, but out of the spontaneity of recognised \nvalues. \n\"Thus, according to beloved Meher Baba, love for animals or birds would be more than \nsympathy or consideration. It is a natural coordinate of acknowledged kinship with them. \nTo deny love to birds or animals is, according to him, to repress one's own divinity. Beloved \nBaba's often repeated mandate to humanity is 'Love life in all its forms.' \n\"... Beloved Meher Baba is God, and as such, experiences himself in all living beings, \nincluding birds, animals, vegetables, etc. We cannot adequately raise any question about \nwhat God's attitude is toward animals. God cannot take up a specific attitude in relation to \nhis creation, because he has himself become that creation. Since beloved Meher Baba is an \nincarnation of God, there can be no question of his taking up any attitude toward any forms \nof his own being... \n\"... All who have had the opportunity to be with him have invariably observed that he loves \nbirds and animals as much as he loves human beings. He often feeds them with his own \nhands, gets all their ailments attended to by competent doctors, and looks after them with \nthe same parental care and love which we find expressed in relation to those humans who \nhave the good fortune to come within his personal environment...\" \nChakradhar Deshmukh, \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba \nfor a letter to Irene Coneybeare, 1957, GG1 p306-307 \n\"Baba had a great feeling for all life. Life must not be treated lightly. Not a worm or an ant \nmust be trodden on consciously. If unconscious, then it was excusable. If a mouse or a rat \nwas caught on the hill, or fell in a well, it had to be rescued, and taken in a trap a mile from \nthe compound and given its freedom. Or again, if a lizard was seen on the wall, it was caught \nin a towel or shooed through the door. \n\"Sick birds, little hares, lame dogs, all found a haven near Baba, and were given into the care \nof Naja, who had a healing touch. When any of our pets died, Baba would always see that \nthey were properly buried, supervising the operation himself, but he did not want us to be \nemotionally upset. Had they not been touched, cared for and loved by Baba? Thus death for \nthem meant progression in evolution.\" \nKitty Davy, LA p295 \n\"... Baba instilled in us respect for all forms of life. Through his tireless and loving example of \ncare and concern for even the tiniest creatures, we too were inspired with such feelings.\" \nMehera Irani, \nBaba Loved Us Too, p40",

    "text": "THE  KINGDOM  OF ANIMALS \nThe animal-form brings to consciousness further expansion, since it can yield new \nexperiences through the greater varieties existing in the kingdom of animals. \nEndowed with life, sensation, and power of voluntary locomotion, quadruped animals have \nto face a struggle for existence and survival. They are sometimes herbivorous and \nsometimes carnivorous. \nAnimal consciousness does not assert its existence in the Gross world through erect or \nupright posture, but has a tendency to look downwards with drooping head. Apes, however, \nare the most evolved type of animals, and they tend to stand erect like human beings. \nMeher Baba, before 1955, GS p31-32 \nTo love God in the most practical way is to love our fellow beings. If we feel for others in the \nsame way as we feel for our own dear ones, we love God... \nIf we understand and feel that the greatest act of devotion and worship to God is not to hurt \nor harm any of his beings, we are loving God. \nbefore 1955? PL p86. Also LH p189 \nThe onward march of evolving consciousness from one species to another proceeds step by \nstep, and very rarely by leaps. But the diverse steps in onward evolution must not be rigidly \nconstrued. \nIf a particular species is extinct, its spiritual purpose can be served by some other kindred \nspecies, or by added births in some complementary species, or by deficient and partial \nexpressions through a slightly higher species. \nIn short, evolution takes advantage of innumerable alternatives available to it. It can never \nbe frustrated by minor gaps constituted by extinct species or missing links. \nEven if the kangaroos, whooping cranes, or any other species of plants or animals become \nextinct, it will neither arrest nor hamper the advancing life-stream. Nor will it frustrate the \nreal purpose of evolution, which is to arrive at full consciousness. Even if there were a \nhundred missing links, the advancing life-stream can either forge new suitable species, or \nmake new use of existing species... \nIn its creative self-fulfillment, the advancing life-stream can and does forge new species, \nsuch as natural or artificial hybrids in vegetable or animal kingdoms. Even man-made \nhybrids in plants or animals can become a medium for gathering fresh experiences in the \nascending scale of evolution. \nBut it is not compulsory for every soul to go through these hybrid forms. It is open to the \nsoul to gather these experiences through the parent species from which the hybrids have \nsprung into existence. However, evolution is sometimes expedited through hybrid forms, \nand this would be applicable to the products of interracial marriages. \nThe advancing life-stream creates numerous forms. But no form should be regarded as a \ncage, restricting and canalising the gathering of experiences in a manner that would exclude \nintercommunion with other forms of the same species, or even with forms of other species. \nHuman beings communicate with each other, and evolve together by an interchange of \nexperiences. In the same way, intercommunication of some type is an important factor even \nin the world of plants and animals. Exchange of experiences and evolving together are not \nnecessarily conditioned by the use of spoken or written language, which facilitates profiting \nby each others' experiences. \nMen can understand each other through spoken or written language, and get an opportunity \nof sharing life with others. But animals also share life together, despite the absence of such \nlanguage. Even animals and plants have a language of their own, a mode of partial or \nrudimentary intercommunion. They share life with other forms and advance together. \nIn fact, all forms and species live in a common world. They not only share life with forms of \ntheir own species, but also with forms of other species. Thus birds, beasts, plants and \nhuman beings, and all that lives and breathes, make their contributions to the unfolding life \nof each. The unfoldment of the divine in life is a common enterprise, and not an exclusive \nachievement... \nIn the sub-human creation, reincarnation of evolved consciousness takes place through the \nSubtle matrix, from which at a later stage a fully formed Subtle body develops. Plants and \nanimals do not have a fully developed Subtle body, but the rudimentary Subtle matrix \ngradually takes shape according to the stage of development achieved. This Subtle matrix is \nthe vehicle for the transmigration of sub-human consciousness from one species into \nothers. It is also the medium in which the sub-human creatures live in the Astral before \ntaking a new Gross form... \nOnce a soul acquires the human form, the general rule is an onward march through human \nincarnations only. Retrograde incarnation is extremely rare in the advancing self-fulfillment \nof the life-stream. It sometimes results from flagrant misuse of occult powers. Retrograde \nincarnation is not a general rule but an extremely rare exception. Continuation of the \nhuman form without reversion to any sub-human form is the normal occurrence. \n1956? Be p23-24 \nThe scope of miracles is very wide. Even the animal world is not exempt from the possibility \nof miracles. \nThough mammals such as porpoises and other animals do not have a fully developed Subtle \nbody, there is in the Subtle world an equivalent or counterpart of their Gross forms. The \nrudimentary Subtle matrix, which has yet to develop into a definite and functionally self-\nsufficient Subtle form, can still serve some purposes and become a medium for performance \nof miracles. \nStories of sorcerers who caused schools of porpoises to come from the open sea to shore for \na native feast are within the bounds of probability. But all this realm of the supernatural, \noccult, miraculous and magic (black or white) must be regarded as having no spiritual value \nin itself. \n1956? Be p 36 \nSuppose a person kills sick animals out of what he regards as compassion for them, i.e., with \nthe intention of giving them relief from suffering. His innermost being does not sanction this \napparent act of compassion, since he would not like that sort of compassion to be expressed \ntowards him if he were ill. This implicit acknowledgment of cruelty involved in killing sick \nanimals is sufficient to necessitate his having to become in some life a shepherd or a \ncowherd or a herder in the animal kingdom. \nVery similar is the case of one who keeps hens awake all night in order that they should lay \nmore eggs, not realising the callousness involved in it. \nIn the world of plants, also, one may inadvertently or deliberately cause wanton \ndestruction, only to attract to himself the role of a horticulturist or a gardener. \nThe harm which one may have inadvertently or deliberately done to any living beings has to \nbe made good. In a future incarnation he has to nourish and protect those very souls in \nsome other form, either as a kind head of a family or a wise ruler. \n1956?

    "text": "ARCHANGELS \nMeher Baba \nThe dissolution of the Subtle plane is the phenomenon which we term Qiamat or \nMahapralaya, and both the Gross and Subtle worlds recede and remain involved in the \nMental plane in seed form. \nThe Mental or seed-body is a point of light (Causal body) on this plane. Extended or \nmagnified, it's called the Supra-Mental body.  The Sub-Mental plane is the rest-house of \nWalis of the sixth plane, and the Supra-Mental plane is the abode of Archangels. This plane, \nunlike the Subtle and the Gross, is eternal in character. \nThe Archangels are a creation by themselves, and are embodiments of God's qualities. In \norder to realise God, unlike the Angels or spirits, who are all evolved beings, the Archangels, \nafter a cyclic period, directly take the human form and achieve the object in one lifetime. \nThe reason why is this. The ocean of divinity consists of drops and waves in a latent form. \nAs soon as the surface of the ocean was ruffled with motion, the waves came into being, and \nthese waves have all the attributes of the ocean in them. These big waves are the \nArchangels, the manifestations of the principle attributes of God, such as Brahma, Vishnu \nand Mahesh. \nThe effort to cause the big waves, i.e., the Archangels, has resulted in producing \nconsciousness, but of rather an impotent nature. In order to remedy this deficiency, and to \ndevelop and attain full and complete consciousness, as that of human form, the Archangels \neven have to incarnate as human beings at the end of every cycle -- which, according to our \ncomputation or measure of time, may come to three or four hundred years. \nAw 15: 3&4 p62-63 \nThe Archangels are the mediums for the expression of God's principal divine attributes of \ncreating, preserving and destroying limited life on an unlimited scale, and of communicating \nunlimited knowledge on a limited scale. The Archangels are entities who always enjoy and \nnever suffer. \nThe abode of the Archangels, the sub-supramental spheres of the fourth, the composite \nsphere... comes after the third -- the Mental sphere -- and is nearest the fifth, the Real \nsphere. \nThis is true, yet not the whole truth. For in spite of its proximity, it cannot touch the Real \nsphere. \nAn Archangel from the highest sub-supramental sphere can never see God, whereas man in \nthe sixth plane of the third, the Mental sphere, can and does see God face to face everywhere \nand in everything. \nThe last point of the last of the sub-supramental spheres is what the Sufis call the sadrat-ul-\nmuntaha (the last limit), beyond which, as is properly and rightly believed by the Muslims, \neven the Archangel Gabriel cannot go. \nMan has and man shall (because man alone can) jump over the last seven links of the really \nnon-existent relative existences of all the four spheres into his really own -- the fifth, the \nReal sphere. \nIn short, Angels must necessarily cease to be Angels and become man before they can reach \nthe reality attainable to man. And when man ceases to be man and enters the I am God state, \nhe realises that Angels and Archangels are, in fact, his own attributes in one sense or \nanother. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, GS p247-248 \nThe three attributes of God (Emanator, Sustainer and Dissolver) are expressed through the \nthree Archangels: \nIsrafeel, the Angel who creates life, \nMikaeel, the Angel who sustains life, \nand Izraeel, the Angel who destroys life. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, GS p178 \nEven the evolution of Angels and Archangels, with all of their hierarchy, is not to be \nregarded as an exclusive stream in advancing life. They can incarnate among the human \nbeings and become linked up with the human stream of life. They are also subject to the \nlaws of cycles, and all that happens to them is subject to the control of Perfect Masters. \n1956? Be p24 \nSome drop-bubbles remain latent in the six states of the oceanic stir. They remain \nstationary in the Mental or Subtle planes with only bubbles of mind, or bubbles of energy. \nSuch drop-souls with only bubbles of mind are called Archangels, and they exist in the \nMental world. Drop-souls with only bubbles of energy are called Angels, and they exist in \nthe third Subtle plane. Archangels have a Mental body, but no Gross form. They have Mental \nconsciousness without sanskaras. Angels have a Subtle body, but no Gross form. They have \nSubtle consciousness without sanskaras. \nAll other drop-bubbles which come out of the Nothing pass into the seventh state of \nmovement, the Gross world, to journey through evolution, reincarnation and involution. \nThis journey has a purpose - it ends in an answer. The purpose is to attain Everything, and \nthe answer is 'I am God' to Everything's question 'Who am I?' \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1968,  Meherazad, NE p37 \nWhen the drop-bubbles first entered creation through the Mental planes unconsciously, \nsome became Archangels that exist in the sixth heaven... \n...Only in human form can a soul become God-realised. God-realisation is the divine goal of \nall life... \nAfter only one birth and lifetime as a human being, that Archangel... receives Liberation \nfrom all future births and deaths - Mukti, the state of infinite bliss realised... \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba \n1968, NE p79-81 \nArchangels Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "INTERVIEWS WITH NINE ARTISTS \nLeopold Stokowski, an orchestra conductor \nStokowski: How can unity be brought about between East and West, especially when the \nconditions prevailing are quite contrary? \nBaba: Reconciliation is possible and can be achieved. It can and will be done. I will do it. It is \nthe internal that matters, not the external. When the soul becomes enlightened it \nexperiences reality. And however diverse the conditions may be, everything is seen and \nexperienced as one. \nStokowski: I have asked many wise people the same question, but none could satisfy me as \nyour clear-cut answer has. \nBaba: It is not a matter of thought or feeling. I know and do. \nStokowski: Is outward beauty necessary for the inner? \nBaba: From your standpoint as an artist, you see all that is outwardly beautiful in nature \nand, through it, the internal. It is good. But once the inner perception is gained, nothing \nremains of external beauty or ugliness - all is alike. \n25 November 1931, New York, \nLM4 p1488 \nThe following seven interviews probably took place in Europe in the early 1930s: \n- 1 - \n(A woman) \nQ. I am a painter. \nBaba: I am also a painter. I paint the hearts of people with colors of spirituality. You are a \ngood soul. \nQ. I feel I have a guilty heart. \nBaba: No, you are not guilty as you believe. Everyone has weaknesses, but it is the heart that \ncounts. You need not worry. I will help you spiritually. \n- 2 - \n(A man, a well-known dancer) \nQ. ... I am a dancer, and am very glad to see you. \nBaba: Dancing is a very good art if expressed rightly. It has divine qualities, and if properly \nexpressed, it will have a wonderful effect. If expressed wrongly, it has the opposite effect... I \nam happy to see you. \nQ. I feel so happy, too. \nBaba: Anything more? \nQ. Since a certain time, I do not quite clearly understand my own individual way to do \nthings, that is, the right way to express myself through art. \nBaba: Soon you will know. I will help you spiritually. You will feel it. This contact will help \nyou henceforth. \n- 3 - \n(A man, with his two sons) \nQ. I am a painter. \nBaba: I am also a painter. I paint with the colors of spirituality. \nQ. That is what I want, the spiritual insight. \nBaba: It will come. Anything more to ask? \nQ. I want a better opening for the expression of art, something spiritual. \nBaba: It will come. For the present, any way that you think appropriate for expressing your \nart is good. And when you will feel something better to express, then automatically and by \nitself it will open out to you. \nQ. That is what I think also. \nBaba: There is one painter in India. When we were both young, he came to me and showed \nme his paintings. They were fantastic. Though I saw and knew they were not good, I said, \n'They are good. Go on.' After a year or so, he came back to me and showed me some more. \nThey were marvelous. Yet I did not say they were marvelous. I only said, 'Go on,' and today \nhe is one of the greatest artists of the East. So whatever you feel like doing, go on doing. It \nwill go on developing by itself. How do you like my paintings? (Baba pointed to the beautiful \nscenery outside.) All this is my painting. \nQ. I wish I could paint a thousandth part of it. \nBaba: You will, when you will feel the proper intuition. I will help you. \n- 4 - \n(A man) \nBaba: Happy to see you. \nQ. I am an artist, and have encountered opposition always. I am trying to find a clear way in \nthe face of it all, and I have always to go in for pure influence. \nBaba: There lies the fun of the game, to meet opposition, to face and encounter it. If not, life \nbecomes dull and monotonous. One can find spirituality only through opposition. But when \nyou are facing it, if you are determined, it becomes enduring, just like a wall which stands \nerect, unaffected, against any number of balls struck at it, the balls rebounding with the \nsame force with which they are struck against the wall. On encountering opposition, life \nbecomes enduring, determined and unaffected, like the wall that stands erect and \nunaffected against the continued strokes of the ball thrown against it. And art is a divine \nthing. It can only be rightly expressed if opposed, to bring out its inner beauty that lies \nbehind. I will help you spiritually. \n- 5 - \n(A woman, with her 16 year old son) \nBaba: Feeling nervous? \nQ. Yes. I am an artist. \nBaba: I am also an artist. I have the whole world as my canvas. I paint souls... \nQ. I am stricken with the failures I have met. I am a very sensitive soul. \nBaba: I know. You have a great heart. It is the feeling that matters, and not explanations. \nQ. I am suffering very much being unable to express my feelings. I never found a way to \nexpress myself in art. Creative power in art did find an outlet through people, but not \nthrough art. \nBaba: But now it will open. And once it is opened, it will pour forth continually. The more it \nis disclosed, the more it comes out. But it must be opened at the right moment. I will help \nyou to open it. You will feel my help, because I help through pure love. And it must open, \nand you will have your right ambition. You have a very good heart. I will help you. \nQ. I feel very, very grateful and relieved. \n- 6 - \n(A woman with her son, an actor) \nQ. Very glad to have met you. \nBaba: Anything to ask? \nQ. How can one achieve one's ambition? (she pointed to her son) He is an artist. \nBaba: And art is one of the sources through which the soul expresses itself and inspires \nothers. But to express art thoroughly, one must have the inner emotions opened thoroughly. \nIf you feel something checks you from expressing yourself thoroughly, then you have to do \none thing. That is to adjust your mental attitude thus: just before expressing, think 'I can and \nwill express it thoroughly,' and every time you express it, you will find you are more \nconvinced of your expression. It is the mind that keeps it closed. \nThere are many actors who, either through inferiority complex, or through nervousness or \nthrough dryness, feel they cannot express, and this feeling of the mind checks the \nexpression. While acting, think you are one of the greatest actors of the world, and try to \nexpress yourself thoroughly. I will help you spiritually. Just think you are the greatest. \nWhere's the harm in thinking like that? It is not for pride you do it, but for bringing the best \nout of you. There is nothing wrong. \nQ. What binds me to the Almighty? \nBaba: Divine love. \nQ. But I do not feel I have it. \nBaba: That is because you are unconscious of it. You will feel it now, and I will help you. \n- 7 - \n(A man) \nQ. I am an artist. \nBaba: I love artists, because through art one can express oneself beautifully. \nQ. Up till now, through ideas, I tried to find the source. Is there any other way to find the \nway to the divine? \n(The interpreter told Baba, 'He has painted fine paintings for a church, with deep insight to \napproach the subject, and not for competition.') \nBaba:  Yes. You have a right to understand and express. Art, when inspired with love, leads \nto higher realms and that art will open for you the inner life. When you paint, you forget \neverything except your object. When you are too much engrossed in it, you are lost in it. And \nwhen you are lost in it, your ego diminishes. And when the ego diminishes, love infinite \nappears. And when love is created, God is attained. So you see how art can lead one to find \ninfinite God. \nQ. I realise that I have my ego, which I must use in a selfless way to express the divine \ninfinite. \nBaba: Then that ego is not finite and limited. It is then the selfless, unlimited ego. \nQ. But this I will always try to develop more and more, even through art, and then leave it to \nyou. \nBaba: Yes, and I will help you spiritually. \nQ. I am sorry to have spoken too much. \nBaba: No, don't worry. I am so glad. You have a very good heart. You will have and feel my \nhelp. \nSeven interviews: Europe? \n1930s, A p1-17, also PM p238-259 \nSee Note on Seven Interviews in Book Two - Art \nUday  Shankar, a well-known classical Indian dancer who performed in the West \nUday Shankar: I want to introduce and spread Indian classical dance to the West, but some \norganisations in India criticise me. They want money from me for their institutions, \norganisations and societies. But I have no money to give them. \nBaba: Every good work has to face opposition, and the reaction of the opposition offered \nalways helps the work. You need not worry. Continue conscientiously with your work with \ndouble zeal in the right direction. \nShankar: Baba, I would like to give a dance performance for you one day. \nBaba: I would be delighted to watch you. \n28 September 1933, \non board the ship M.V. \nConte Verde en route to Venice, \nLM5 p1814",

    "text": "THE ASTRAL WORLD \nMeher Baba \nLower spirits are those beings without physical forms whose sanskaras remain to be wiped \nout. They cannot progress after death until their unfinished sanskaras are worked out. As a \nconsequence, they wander about on the lower Astral plane. For this reason, they are a \nsource of harassment to living people. \nSuppose a man is destined to have a life span of forty years, but he commits suicide when he \nis thirty. Consequently, for the remaining ten year period of unexpressed sanskaras, his \nspirit inhabits the lower planes, and at times is seen by some people as a spirit or ghost. \nTo hold seances or to talk with the dead is no great thing, because such spirits are always \namong us on this living plane. There are advanced yogis and munis who converse with these \nghosts who have committed suicide, as well as with the spirits of the higher planes. These \nadvanced souls communicate without using a medium. They live on both levels. \n2 June 1925, Meherabad, LM2 p720 \nGhosts are people who have committed suicide and have no body. They enter another body, \nand then make the body of whomsoever they enter do as they wish. \n15 December 1927, Ahmednagar, LM3 p994 \nAlthough the Gross is the outcome of the Subtle and is dependent on the latter, the Subtle is \ncompletely independent of the Gross... \nTo begin experiencing gradually but with full consciousness the Subtle universe means \ngetting initiated into the first mystical journey. In other words, when a soul, through the \nmedia of the mind and the Subtle organs, begins to experience in full consciousness the \nSubtle sphere - just as a man of the world experiences, through the media of the mind and \nthe Gross  organs, the Gross sphere in full consciousness - he can be said to have entered the \nPath and acquired some gnosis. \nOf the seven stages or planes of the first journey, the first four belong to the Subtle sphere. \nBut this does not mean that communications with and glimpses of the spirits of the dead \namount to an experience of the Subtle sphere. \nIn a way, even an ordinary dream is also a subconscious experience of the Subtle, because \neveryone necessarily makes an actual use of one's Subtle body in the dreaming state. But be \nit noted, through that body one experiences different sensations and happenings pertaining \nto the Gross only. In other words, the ordinary dreaming state is the experiencing of the \nGross through the Subtle means in the subconscious state. \nOf course the case regarding communications with the spirits of the dead is not the same as \nthat of the dreaming state. Just as a man in the ordinary dreaming state uses his Subtle body \nsubconsciously, and thereby experiences different sensations pertaining to the Gross \nsphere, so in certain cases a man can consciously so use his Gross organs as to get the \nexperiences of the Semi-Subtle sphere. And this amounts to being able to have \ncommunications with, or getting glimpses of, the spirits of the dead. Therefore spirit \ncommunication is the experience of the Semi-Subtle through the Gross means in the \nconscious state. It is not at all a mark of advancement on the divine Path, as it has nothing to \ndo with the gnosis, the Subtle sphere and the planes. \nThere lies a world of difference between the Subtle and the Semi-Subtle. The Semi-Subtle is \nthe link between the Gross and the Subtle spheres. The spirits of all human beings (with the \nexception of those who have gone beyond the fourth plane, or the stage of the first journey) \ncome to this Semi-Subtle sphere. And according to their sanskaras, they either go to heaven \nor to hell, from which they again return to the Semi-Subtle sphere, without, however, \nnecessarily being aware of it. \nIt is the spirits that are in the 'waiting room' of the Semi-Subtle sphere who are likely to \nenter into communications with those who are in the Gross sphere. They may either be on \nthe point of going to heaven or hell, or may have finished their terms of pleasure and pain in \nheaven or hell, as the case may be. Or they may be directly awaiting reincarnation following \nthe last physical death. But it is only these spirits that can be communicated with, though \nnot always with a mathematical precision as believed by many. \nAs to the various descriptions of the conditions prevailing in the Semi-Subtle sphere and in \nheaven or hell, which are purported to come from such spirits, some of these are in some \nway or other true. But it is not proper to attach importance to them. The Semi-Subtle \nsphere, and even heaven and hell, and the respective happiness and sufferings in them, are \nnot of real existence. The experiences in the Semi-Subtle are like those in a dream. And \nheaven and hell are nothing but states in which the jeevatma (individual soul), according to \nhis good or bad sanskaras, experiences Subtle enjoyments and miseries respectively \nthrough the Subtle organs. When the jeevatma gets Self-realised, heaven and hell are found \nto have been imaginary existences, just as one, who in the dreaming state enjoys and \nsuffers, finds the dream experiences devoid of reality when one gets up. \nWorldly people can never enter into communication with higher spirits, i.e. spirits \nbelonging to the Subtle, Mental and Super-Mental spheres. For though the spirits of the \nSubtle and also, in some cases, of the Mental spheres, have to reincarnate, they don't have to \nstay in the Semi-Subtle sphere at any time. Spiritually advanced persons can, of course, \ncommunicate with advanced disembodied spirits, but they do not do so, for it is \nunnecessary. Spirituality has nothing to do with spiritism or communication with the spirits \nof the dead. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before March 1930, ST p8-9 \nAnother version: Ms 2:3 p8-15, IL p18-21 \nThere are three worlds or planes, and corresponding to them, there are three bodies, the \nGross, the Subtle and the Mental. These worlds or planes should not be mixed up with the \nidea of place or sphere. The purpose of evolution is served with the attainment of the \nhuman form plus  full consciousness. Simultaneous with the human body, the Subtle and \nMental bodies make their appearance. \nThere is also another body, called the Astral body, which persists long after death, and \nbelongs to the Sub-Subtle or lower of the seven regions of the Subtle plane. It is connected \nwith both the Subtle and Gross planes or worlds. The Astral body is exactly the replica of the \nhuman body in all details. As is the Astral body, so will be the Gross body. The former is \nvapory or smoky in appearance, unlike the Subtle body, which has form, but no defined \norgans. \nThe experience of heaven and hell, enjoyment and suffering, is undergone by this body, and \nno sooner are the sanskaras acquired while in the Gross body spent up, than the Astral body \nis destroyed, leaving faint impressions on the Subtle body. \n1930s? Aw 15: 3 & 4 p62 \nIf you see Chanji with your Gross eyes, you see his figure _ no circle, no colors surrounding \nhim. But if you concentrate and can see him through your Subtle eyes, you can see his Astral \nform without color or mark, a faint form, a bit blue or grayish. If, however, you have \ndeveloped Mental consciousness and see him through your Mental eye, you see him in the \nform of a circle with seven colors, all blended together in one. This can only be seen by a \nmaster. \nColors are due to sanskaras created by imagination. Why seven colors? When the first clash \nbetween Energy and the Heavens or Space (Pran and Akash) took place, it created a spark, a \ncircle which had seven colors. All such sparks have seven colors. \nNo one knows that even before the electron, there is one form in the beginning. But what \nname to give it? The clash of Energy entering Space created this first form. \n11 July 1936, Rahuri, LM6 p2021 \nGarrett Fort: What about Astral journeys? \nBaba: Astral journeys are taken by persons consciously and unconsciously, but those that \nreally matter are the ones done consciously. You actually experience being aloof from the \nGross body and having a Subtle body, and seeing with the eyes of the Subtle body, and  \nsmelling with the nose of the Subtle body. \nIn a dream when you sleep, this physical body is not used, and yet you see, smell, hear, taste, \netc. You do it all with the Subtle body, but not consciously. \nWhen you do it consciously, you actually experience being aloof from the body. You smell, \nyou eat, you hear, you feel, doing it all as concretely as you do with the Gross body, not \nvaguely as in dreams. You can then actually feel the body as a cloak - you take it off and put \nit on like a garment. Actually - this is not just imagination. \n14 March 1937, Nasik, LM6 p2138 \nAnother version, LA p181 \nGarrett Fort: What is meant by possession? \nBaba: There are certain cases where the Gross body is compelled to drop before the \nperson's sanskaras are completely used up. Such is the case when a person commits suicide. \nThe body is gone, but the momentum of all the impressions goes on. The person is now a \nghost. The ghost wants to drink, eat, etc., very, very badly. So much so that it takes to \nunnatural resources by entering someone else's body. It awaits its opportunity. When it \nfinds you drinking it satisfies its desire by drinking through you, your body. When it has to \nexperience anger, then when you are angry it experiences it through you, your body. This is \na fact. \n14 March 1937, Nasik, LM6 p2139 \nWhy be afraid of ghosts? A ghost means a human being without a body, and in that bodiless \nstate he has to remain as long as the sanskaras of his previous birth last. Then he takes \nanother birth. \nGhosts are miserable. They have desires, like any of us. They try to come in contact with \nhuman beings to fulfill their desires. When it is dark and silent, their Subtle, smoky bodies \nbecome transparent. You have Gross, Subtle and Mental bodies. They have only Subtle and \nMental bodies. but these are not as limited as the Gross. When stretched out, their Subtle \nbody stretches out in all directions - upward and sideways. That makes you shiver and \nscream when you see them like that. Depending on their surroundings, darkness and \nquietude, they can be seen. Their bodies can enlarge and shrink. That is why in dreams the \nSubtle bodies go anywhere, stretching out and out. They can also be photographed in \nsuitable conditions, depending upon the surroundings, time, light, and the photographer. \nThese discarnate spirits wish to contact living human beings. If Rano, a heavy smoker, has \nno body, and for some reason becomes a ghost, she does not get another physical body until \ncertain sanskaras are spent. They may be spent in one year or a million years. All depends \non the contacts made to spend one's sanskaras. \nFor instance, Rano has her craving for smoking cigarettes. She sees Kitty smoking. She, too, \nwants to smoke, and tries to contact Kitty to have a cigarette. But contact with a Gross body \nby the Subtle body is almost impossible. Kitty feels the presence of a Subtle body and is \nscared. But poor Rano only wants to have a smoke. In some instances, she, Rano the ghost, \nbecomes so desperate that she waits until Kitty nods to sleep even the tiniest little bit, and \nthen smokes through Kitty's Gross body. \nThe Subtle can enter any Gross body or thing. When it enters you, you don't even know it, \nand are not at all affected. But it can only enter your body when you are not conscious, \nwhen you are sleeping. How many spirits have been drinking tea through Norina when she \nis not conscious? But the spirit has no hold, it does not reside in you or possess you, but just \ngoes like the wind. And it only happens sometimes. Don't think about it, or you will go mad. \nIt is of no importance, so trivial, so insignificant. \nSometimes you feel angry for nothing. This might be some spirit wanting to spend sankaras \nof anger through you. But this is so unimportant, not worth thinking about. Our bodies are \nfull of germs, but we don't think about it. If we did, and tried to picture it in our minds, we \nwould go mad. \nMasters are so bothered by these spirits, you have no idea. They want to touch me for \nliberation, and they do. \n11 November 1940, Ceylon, \nLM7 p2636-2637 \nDon't be afraid of ghosts. They don't do any real harm. The atmosphere is full of \nimpressions. Sometimes when you think you feel the presence of a spirit, it is not the actual \nspirit but the impressions of the place that you feel. \nDecember 1942, Lonavla, LM8 p2825 \nAn Aura... is the mental reflection of the aggregate impressions of thoughts and actions \ngathered by and stored in an individual mind. As long as the impressions are there, an Aura \nis always there, as an envelope of Subtle atmosphere comprised of seven colors, which \nremain more or less prominent according to the nature of each individual's impressions. \nNo two men are alike in all respects, and yet all have common physical features. Similarly, \nthe aggregates of individual impressions differ from one another, both quantitatively and \nqualitatively, yet every Aura is comprised of seven colors common to all. \nThese seven colors of an individual's Aura represent the seven principal categories \ncorresponding to the aggregate impressions of each individual. Thus every individual Aura \nis an image of a circle of seven colors. Each Aura differs from the others in its proportion of \neach of the seven colors, according to the individual's predominant impressions. \nLikewise each Aura also differs in the color formation on the borders between every two \npredominant colors in it. For example, red would be the most prominent color in the Aura of \na man whose impressions are predominantly made up of lustful actions. \nPL p58 \nThere is no Astral world as such. The Astral world is not a portion of the Subtle world. \nHowever, in between the Gross and the Subtle worlds there are seven sheaths which form \nthe so-called world of the Astral, and this serves as a link between these two worlds. A \nGross-conscious soul may be said to have an Astral body, which links the Gross with the \nSubtle. \nThe Astral may be called the imprint of the Subtle over the Gross, which imprint is neither \nGross nor Subtle. In sleep, in the ordinary dream state, one experiences the impressions of \nthe Gross world with the Subtle body subconsciously, and not with the Astral body. All \nexperiences in the world of the Astral, experienced through the medium of the Astral body, \nare as insignificant as dreams. \nAfter disembodiment, the soul experiences the world of the Astral in the Astral body. This \nmay be said to be the Astral journey of the soul. When the soul gets embodied, the Astral \nbody is shed, and with a new Gross body it gets a fresh Astral body. But as long as it does \nnot get embodied, its Subtle and Mental bodies undergo the experiences of the state of \nheaven or hell through the medium of the Astral body, in accordance with the impressions \nthat were accumulated while it was in an embodied state. \nThe spiritual Path begins only with the involution of consciousness, when the soul begins to \nexperience the first plane of the Subtle world, and not when it just has access to the Astral \nphenomena from the Gross world. At the stage when the soul experiences fully the first \nplane of the Subtle world, the Astral sheath that linked the Subtle with the Gross is snapped \nfor good. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, GS p294-295For more about the Aura, and an \nexplanation of the Halo, see PL p56-60. \nFor more about the Aura, and an explanation of the Halo, see PL p56-60. \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "THE AVATAR \nMeher Baba \nOf the 56 God-realised souls on earth, the five Perfect Masters are the most important. And \nthe one who is the highest of all is the Avatar, myself. \nI come every 700 to 1400 years, and it is undoubtably a very rare and lucky thing for each of \nyou to have the opportunity of loving me individually, since even the Sadgurus long to touch \nthe Avatar physically. \nWhen the world is in the grip of pain, misery, suffering and chaos, I manifest myself. \nSpirituality then reaches its pinnacle, and materialism is at its lowest level. Then again, with \nthe passing of time, spirituality diminishes and materialism increases. \nFrom the beginning of time this game has been going on, and it will go on for an eternity. \n3 June 1927, Meherabad, LM3 p944 \nThe one who manifests as the Avatar has to give a spiritual push to the whole world. This is \ngreater than the circle preparation work which all Sadgurus have to perform. This great \npush is the main difference in their duties. \nBesides this difference, the Avatar is always perfect in all respects, spiritually as well as \nmaterially, and in particular physically. The Avatar always has a charming personality, with \na beautiful, symmetrical face and body, while the Perfect Masters are generally of odd size \nand shape physically, with certain defects, sometimes so abhorrent that one does not even \nlike to look at them. \nChrist, Muhammad, Zarathustra, Buddha, Rama and Krishna were Avatars, and hence had \ncharming personalities. So is mine. Upasani Maharaj, Narayan Maharaj and such present \nPerfect Masters have one personal defect or another. \nUpasani Maharaj's stature is too big, like a giant. Narayan Maharaj is too small, short in \nstature, like a dwarf. But this physical difference between the Avatar and Sadgurus makes \nno real difference in their spiritual status, which is always divine. \n5 December 1929, Nasik, LM4 p1259 \nThere are 56 Perfect Ones in the world at all times. They are always one in consciousness. \nThey are always different in function. For the most part they live and work apart from and \nunknown to the general public, but five, who act in a sense as a directing body, always work \nin public and attain to public prominence and importance.* In Avataric periods the Avatar, \nas a supreme Sadguru, takes his place as the head of this body, and of the Spiritual \nHierarchy as a whole. \n*These five Perfect Ones are the five Perfect Masters of the age. They are also known as \nSadgurus or Qutubs. \nAvataric periods are like the springtide of creation. They bring a new release of power, a \nnew awakening of consciousness, a new experience of life, not merely for a few, but for all. \nQualities of energy and awareness which had been used and enjoyed by only a few \nadvanced souls are made available for all humanity. Life as a whole is stepped up to a higher \nlevel of consciousness, is geared to a new rate of energy. The transition from sensation to \nreason was one such step. The transition from reason to intuition will be another. \nThis new influx of the creative impulse takes, through the medium of a divine personality, \nan incarnation of God in a special sense - an Avatar. This Avatar was the first individual soul \nto emerge from the evolutionary process as a Sadguru, and he is the only Avatar who has \never manifested or will ever manifest. Through him, God first completed the journey from \nunconscious divinity to conscious divinity, first unconsciously became man in order \nconsciously to become God. Through him, periodically, God consciously becomes man for \nthe liberation of mankind. \nThe Avatar appears in different forms, under different names, at different times, in different \nparts of the world. As his appearance always coincides with the spiritual birth of man, so the \nperiod immediately preceding his manifestation is always one in which humanity suffers \nfrom the pangs of the approaching birth... \nBeing the total manifestation of God in human form, he is like a gauge against which man \ncan measure what he is and what he may become. He trues the standard of human values by \ninterpreting them in terms of divinely human life. He is interested in everything, but not \nconcerned about anything. The slightest mishap may command his sympathy; the greatest \ntragedy will not upset him. He is beyond the alternations of pain and pleasure, desire and \nsatisfaction, rest and struggle, life and death. To him they are equally illusions which he has \ntranscended, but by which others are bound, and from which he has come to free them. He \nuses every circumstance as a means to lead others towards Realisation... \nIn those who contact him he awakens a love that consumes all selfish desires in the flame of \nthe one desire to serve him. Those who consecrate their lives to him gradually become \nidentified with him in consciousness. Little by little, their humanity is absorbed into his \ndivinity, and they become free... \nThe Avatar awakens contemporary humanity to a realisation of its true spiritual nature, \ngives Liberation to those who are ready, and quickens the life of the spirit in his time. For \nposterity is left the stimulating power of his divinely human example, the nobility of a life \nsupremely lived, of a love unmixed with desire, of a power unused except for others, of a \npeace untroubled by ambition, of a knowledge undimmed by illusion. He has demonstrated \nthe possibility of a divine life for all humanity, of a heavenly life on earth. Those who have \nthe necessary courage and integrity can follow when they will... \n1938, India, MJ 1:1 p4-7 \nAnother version: Di (7th ed.) p268-270 \nThere are always 56 God-realised souls. Now, out of these 56, five are sent out into the \nworld. But in every Avataric period these five become one, thus demonstrating the cycle \nwhen the Avatar appears in form. Therefore, the Avatar exists in the heart of these five as \none. \nThese five are God-realised like the Avatar. All are one. But in the Avataric period, the \nAvatar is equal to five Sadgurus. Thus, five Sadgurus make one Avatar - that is the long and \nshort of it. Therefore, if the Sadgurus were to show their hearts, you would find me in them. \nFive are always alive. Babajan left her body. The one in her place need not necessarily be in \nPoona, but there must be five in the world. \n28 September 1938, \nMeherabad, LM7 p2324 \nThe Avatar descends from his highest state of divine consciousness to the state of human \nconsciousness. He does not need to pass through the stages of evolution, reincarnation and \nRealisation. He is God always, and comes down directly from his God-state to man-state, and \nbecomes conscious of creation. His benevolent work is universal, and he gives a spiritual \npush to all objects in creation, inert and living, animate and inanimate both. \nLM7 p2435 \nThe Avatar has to incur upon himself the infinite burden of worries of the entire suffering \nworld, while working in the world for the spiritual upliftment of humanity. This suffering of \npeople steeped in the darkness of ignorance becomes the Avatar's suffering. This is his \ncrucifixion. The Avatar is crucified every moment of his life on earth. \nBut with this infinite suffering which he has to take upon himself, he also has the infinite \nbliss of the Perfect state which he eternally experiences. Otherwise it would be utterly \nimpossible, and he would be literally crushed under the burden of such suffering from all \nsides. If an ordinary man, however great, were to feel even a thousandth part of the Avatar's \nsuffering, he would go mad. The Avatar has to bear this burden to lighten the load of the \nsuffering of the world... \nIt is my life mission to remove the burden of mankind's suffering. I have come for this. But, \nreally speaking, it is not my work, but the ignorance of people, and their underlying \nindifference towards things spiritual, that makes me suffer. \n1939, Meherabad, \nLM7 p2436-2437 \nIt is wrong to believe that Prophets or Masters or Avatars have come to give religions to the \nworld. The so-called religions are an effort to commemorate the association with a great \nspiritual Master, and to preserve his atmosphere and influence. It is like an archeological \ndepartment trying to preserve things which only resuscitate the past. \nto Abdul Ghani, \nHM p163 \nI am the last Avatar in this present cycle of twenty-four, and therefore the greatest and most \npowerful. \nI have the attributes of five. I am as pure as Zoroaster, as truthful as Ram, as mischievous as \nKrishna, as gentle as Jesus, and as fiery as Muhammad. \nto his women Mandali, \nDecember 1942 \nMeherabad, GO p72 \nThere are three languages in which the Avatar teaches: \nIn ordinary language, for the masses who follow the shariat (custom) and ritual of their \nreligion, so that they can understand. \nIn language both ordinary and mystical, for the few advanced souls. \nIn language wholly mystical, for the circle. \nZarathustra gave the masses shariat, as in those days they could well understand good \nthoughts, good words and good deeds. He did not say in clear words, 'Act, and don't care \nabout the result,' since they would not have been able to accept it. So Zarathustra said the \nsame thing, but in a different way. \nMuhammad said, 'Keep engrossed in action alone. If you act well, you will go to heaven. If \nyou act evil, you will go to hell.' \nKrishna said, 'Act, but do not care for the results. Dedicate them to me.' Why? Because the \natmosphere then was full of warring spirits. \nJesus also said, 'Act, but in the spirit of sacrifice.' \nAll these teachings given by the Avatars were according to the exigencies of the times then \nprevailing. \n17 May 1943, Meherabad, LM8 p2887 \nConsciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, each and every creature, each and \nevery human being strives to assert individuality. When eventually man consciously \nexperiences that he is infinite, eternal and indivisible, he is fully conscious of his \nindividuality as God, and experiences infinite knowledge, infinite power and infinite bliss. \nThus man becomes God, and is recognized as a Perfect Master, Sadguru, or Qutub. \nWhen God manifests on earth in the form of man and reveals his divinity to mankind, he is \nrecognized as the Avatar - thus God becomes man. \nAnd so infinite God, age after age, throughout all cycles, wills through his infinite mercy to \neffect his presence amidst mankind by stooping down to human level in the human form, \nbut his physical presence amidst mankind not being apprehended, he is looked upon as an \nordinary man of the world.  When he asserts, however, his divinity on earth by proclaiming \nhimself the Avatar of the age, he is worshipped by some who accept him as God; and \nglorified by a few who know him as God on Earth.  But it invariably falls to the lot of the rest \nof humanity to condemn him while he is physically in their midst. \nThus it is that God as man, proclaiming himself as the Avatar, suffers himself to be \npersecuted and tortured, to be humiliated and condemned by humanity for whose sake his \ninfinite love has made him stoop so low, in order that humanity, by its very act of \ncondemning God's manifestation in the form of Avatar should, however, indirectly, assert \nthe existence of God in his infinite eternal state. \nThe Avatar is always one and the same, because God is always one and the same, the \neternal, indivisible, infinite one, who manifests himself in the form of man as the Avatar, as \nthe Messiah, as the Prophet, as the Ancient One - the Highest of the High.  This eternally one \nand the same Avatar repeats his manifestation from time to time, in different cycles, \nadopting different human forms and different names, in different places, to reveal Truth in \ndifferent garbs and different languages, in order to raise humanity from the pit of ignorance \nand free it from the bondage of delusions. \nOf the most recognized and much worshipped manifestations of God as Avatar, that of \nZoroaster is the earlier - having been before Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus and Muhammad. \nThousands of years ago, he gave to the world the essence of Truth in the form of three \nfundamental precepts -  \"Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds.\"  These precepts \nwere and are constantly unfolded to humanity in one form or another, directly or indirectly \nin every cycle, by the Avatar of the age, as he leads humanity towards the Truth. To put \nthese precepts of good thoughts, good words and good deeds into practice is not easily \ndone, though it is not impossible. But to live up to these precepts honestly and literally is \napparently as impossible as it is to practise a living death in the midst of life. \nIn the world there are countless sadhus, mahatmas, mahapurushas, saints, yogis and walis, \nthough the number of genuine ones is very, very limited. The few genuine ones are, \naccording to their spiritual status, in a category of their own, which is neither on a level with \nthe ordinary human being nor on a level with the state of the Highest of the High. \nI am neither a mahatma nor a mahapurush, neither a sadhu nor a saint, neither a yogi nor a \nwali. Those who approach me with the desire to gain wealth or to retain their possessions, \nthose who seek through me relief from distress and suffering, those who ask my help to \nfulfil and satisfy mundane desires, to them I once again declare that, as I am not a sadhu, a \nsaint or a mahatma, mahapurush or yogi, to seek these things through me is but to court \nutter disappointment, though only apparently; for eventually the disappointment is itself \ninstrumental in bringing about the complete transformation of mundane wants and desires. \nThe sadhus, saints, yogis, walis and such others who are on the via media, can and do \nperform miracles and satisfy the transient material needs of individuals who approach them \nfor help and relief. \nThe question therefore arises that if I am not a sadhu, not a saint, not a yogi, not a \nmahapurush nor a wali, then what am I?  The natural assumption would be that I am either \njust an ordinary human being, or I am the Highest of the High. But one thing I say definitely, \nand that is that I can never be included amongst those having the intermediary status of the \nreal sadhus, saints, yogis and such others. \nNow, if I am just an ordinary man, my capabilities and powers are limited - I am no better or \ndifferent from an ordinary human being. If people take me as such they should not expect \nsupernatural help from me in the form of miracles or spiritual guidance; and to approach \nme to fulfil their desires would also be absolutely futile. \nOn the other hand, if I am beyond the level of an ordinary human being, and much beyond \nthe level of saints and yogis, then I must be the Highest of the High. In which case, to judge \nme with your human intellect and limited mind and to approach me with mundane desires \nwould not only be the height of folly but sheer ignorance as well; because no amount of \nintellectual effort could ever understand my ways or judge my Infinite State. \nIf I am the Highest of the High, my will is law, my wish governs the law, and my love sustains \nthe universe.  Whatever your apparent calamities and transient sufferings, they are but the \noutcome of my love for the ultimate good.  Therefore, to approach me for deliverance from \nyour predicaments, to expect me to satisfy your worldly desires, would be asking me to do \nthe impossible - to undo what I have already ordained. \nIf you truly and in all faith accept your Baba as the Highest of the High, it behooves you to \nlay down your life at his feet, rather than to crave the fulfilment of your desires. Not your \none life but your millions of lives would be but a small sacrifice to place at the feet of one \nsuch as Baba, who is the Highest of the High; for Baba's unbounded love is the only sure and \nunfailing guide to lead you safely through the innumberable blind alleys of your transient \nlife. \nThey cannot obligate me, who, surrendering their all - body, mind, possessions - which \nperforce they must discard one day - surrender with a motive; surrender because they \nunderstand that to gain the everlasting treasure of bliss they must relinquish ephemeral \npossessions.  This desire for greater gain is still clinging behind their surrender, and as such \nthe surrender cannot be complete. \nKnow you all that if I am the Highest of the High, my role demands that I strip you of all your \npossessions and wants, consume all your desires and make you desireless rather than \nsatisfy your desires. Sadhus, saints, yogis and walis can give you what you want; but I take \naway your wants and free you from attachments and liberate you from the bondage of \nignorance.  I am the one to take, not the one to give what you want or as you want. \nMere intellectuals can never understand me through their intellect. If I am the Highest of the \nHigh, it becomes impossible for the mind to gauge me nor is it possible for my ways to be \nfathomed by the human mind. \nI am not to be attained by those who, loving me, stand reverently by in rapt admiration. I am \nnot for those who ridicule me and point at me with contempt.  To have a crowd of tens of \nmillions flocking around me is not what I am for. I am for the few who, scattered amongst \nthe crowd, silently and unostentatiously surrender their all - body, mind and possessions - \nto me. I am still more for those who, after surrendering their all, never give another thought \nto their surrender. They are all mine who are prepared to renounce even the very thought \nof their renunciation and who, keeping constant vigil in the midst of intense activity, await \ntheir turn to lay down their lives for the cause of Truth at a glance or sign from me. Those \nwho have indomitable courage to face willingly and cheerfully the worst calamities, who \nhave unshakable faith in me, eager to fulfil my slightest wish at the cost of their happiness \nand comfort, they indeed, truly love me. \nFrom my point of view, far more blessed is the atheist who confidently discharges his \nworldly responsibilities, accepting them as his honourable duty, than the man who \npresumes he is a devout believer in God, yet shirks the responsibilities apportioned to him \nthrough divine law and runs after sadhus, saints and yogis, seeking relief from the suffering \nwhich ultimately would have pronounced his eternal Liberation. \nTo have one eye glued on the enchanting pleasures of the flesh and with the other expect to \nsee a spark of Eternal Bliss is not only impossible but the height of hypocrisy. \nI cannot expect you to understand all at once what I want you to know. It is for me to \nawaken you from time to time throughout the ages, sowing the seed in your limited minds, \nwhich must in due course and with proper heed and care on your part, germinate, flourish \nand bear the fruit of that True Knowledge which is inherently yours to gain. \nIf on the other hand, led by your ignorance, you persist in going your own way, none can \nstop you in your choice of progress; for that too is progress which, however slow and \npainful, eventually and after innumerable re-incarnations, is bound to make you realize that \nwhich I want you to know now. To save yourself from further entanglement in the maze of \ndelusion and self-created suffering, which owes its magnitude to the extent of your \nignorance of the true Goal, awake now. Pay heed and strive for freedom by experiencing \nignorance in its true perspective.  Be honest with yourself and God. One may fool the world \nand one's neighbours, but one can never escape from the knowledge of the Omniscient - \nsuch is the divine law. \nI declare to all of you who approach me, and to those of you who desire to approach me, \naccepting me as the Highest of the High, that you must never come with the desire in your \nheart which craves for wealth and worldly gain, but only with the fervent longing to give \nyour all-body, mind and possessions - with all their attachments. Seek me not to extricate \nyou from your predicaments, but find me in order to surrender yourself wholeheartedly to \nmy Will. Cling to me not for worldly happiness and short-lived comforts, but adhere to me, \nthrough thick and thin, sacrificing your own happiness and comforts at my feet. Let my \nhappiness be your cheer and my comfort your rest.  Do not ask me to bless you with a good \njob, but desire to serve me more diligently and honestly without expectation of reward. \nNever beg of me to save your life or the lives of your dear ones, but beg of me to accept you \nand permit you to lay down your life for me. Never expect me to cure you of your bodily \nafflictions, but beseech me to cure you of your ignorance. Never stretch out your hands to \nreceive anything from me, but hold them high in praise of me whom you have approached \nas the Highest of the High. \nIf I am then the Highest of the High, nothing is impossible to me; and though I do not \nperform miracles to satisfy individual needs - the satisfaction of which would result in \nentangling the individual more and more in the net of ephemeral existence - yet time and \nagain at certain periods I manifest the infinite Power in the form of miracles, but only for \nthe spiritual upliftment and benefit of humanity and all creatures. \nHowever, miraculous experiences have often been experienced by individuals who love me \nand have unswerving faith in me, and these have been attributed to my nazar or grace on \nthem. But I want all to know that it does not befit my lovers to attribute such individual \nmiraculous experiences to my state of the Highest of the High. If I am the Highest of the High \nI am above these illusory plays of maya in the course of the divine law. Therefore, whatever \nmiraculous experiences are experienced by my lovers who recognize me as such, or by \nthose who love me unknowingly through other channels, they are but the outcome of their \nown firm faith in me.  Their unshakable faith, often superseding the course of the play of \nmaya, gives them those experiences which they call miracles. Such experiences derived \nthrough firm faith eventually do good and do not entangle the individuals who experience \nthem in further and greater bindings of illusion. \nIf I am the Highest of the High, then a wish of my universal will is sufficient to give, in an \ninstant, God-realization to one and all, and thus free every creature in creation from the \nshackles of Ignorance. But blessed is knowledge that is gained through the experience of \nignorance, in accordance with the divine law. This knowledge is made possible for you to \nattain in the midst of ignorance by the guidance of Perfect Masters and by surrender to the \nHighest of the High. \n1954, PL, \"The Highest of the High\" \nWhen I say I am the Avatar, there are a few who feel happy, some who feel shocked, and \nmany who, hearing me claim this, would take me for a hypocrite, a fraud, a supreme egoist, \nor just mad. \nIf I were to say every one of you is an Avatar, a few would be tickled, and many would \nconsider it a blasphemy or a joke. \nThe fact that God, being one, indivisible, and equally in us all, we can be nought else but one, \nis too much for the duality-conscious mind to accept. Yet each of us is what the other is. \nI know I am the Avatar in every sense of the word, and that each of you is an Avatar in one \nsense or the other. \nIt is an unalterable and universally recognised fact, since time immemorial, that God knows \neverything, God does everything, and that nothing happens but by the will of God. \nTherefore it is God who makes me say I am the Avatar, and that each one of you is an Avatar. \nAgain, it is he who is tickled through some, and through others is shocked. \nIt is God who acts and God who reacts it. It is he who scoffs, and he who responds. He is the \ncreator, the producer, the actor and the audience in his own divine play. \n12 September 1954, \nat a mass darshan at Wadia Park, \nAhmednagar, Aw 2:2 p1. \nAnother version: GG6 p92 \nAge after age, when the wick of righteousness burns low, the Avatar comes yet once again to \nrekindle the torch of love and truth.  Age after age, amidst the clamour of disruptions, wars, \nfear and chaos, rings the Avatar's call: \"Come all unto me.\" \nAlthough, because of the veil of illusion, this call of the Ancient One may appear as a voice in \nthe wilderness, its echo and re-echo nevertheless pervades through time and space, to rouse \nat first a few, and eventually millions, from their deep slumber of ignorance.  And In the \nmidst of illusion, as the voice behind all voices, it awakens humanity to bear witness to the \nmanifestation of God amidst mankind. \nThe time is come.  I repeat the Call, and bid all come unto me. \nThis time-honored call of mine thrills the hearts of those who have patiently endured all in \ntheir love for God, loving God only for love of God. There are those who fear and shudder at \nits reverberations, and would flee or resist.  And there are yet others who, baffled, fail to \nunderstand why the Highest of the High, who is all-sufficient, need necessarily give this Call \nto humanity. \nIrrespective of doubts and convictions, and for the infinite love I bear for one and all, I \ncontinue to come as the Avatar, to be judged time and again by humanity in its ignorance, in \norder to help man distinguish the real from the false. \nInvariably muffled in the cloak of the infinitely true humility of the Ancient One, the divine \ncall is at first little heeded, until, in its infinite strength it spreads in volume to reverberate \nand keep on reverberating in countless hearts as the voice of reality. \nStrength begets humility, whereas modesty bespeaks weakness. Only he who is truly great \ncan be really humble. \nWhen, in the firm knowledge of it, a man admits his true greatness, it is in itself an \nexpression of humility.  He accepts his greatness as most natural and is expressing merely \nwhat he is, just as a man would not hesitate to admit to himself and others the fact of his \nbeing man. \nFor a truly great man, who knows himself to be truly great, to deny his greatness would be \nto belittle what he indubitably is.  For whereas modesty is the basis of guise, true greatness \nis free from camouflage. \nOn the other hand, when a man expresses a greatness he knows or feels he does not \npossess, he is the greatest hypocrite. \nHonest is the man who is not great, and, knowing and feeling this, firmly and frankly states \nthat he is not great. \nThere are more than a few who are not great, yet assume a humility in the genuine belief of \ntheir own worth.  Through words and actions they express repeatedly their humbleness, \nprofessing to be servants of humanity. True humility is not acquired by merely donning a \ngarb of humility. True humility spontaneously and continually emanates from the strength \nof the truly great.  Voicing one's humbleness does not make one humble. For all that a \nparrot may utter, \"I am a man,\" it does not make it so. \nBetter the absence of greatness than the establishing of a false greatness by assumed \nhumility.  Not only do these efforts at humility on man's part not express strength, they are, \non the contrary, expressions of modesty born of weakness, which springs from a lack of \nknowledge of the truth of Reality. \nBeware of modesty. Modesty, under the cloak of humility, invariably leads one into the \nclutches of self-deception. Modesty breeds egoism and man eventually succumbs to pride \nthrough assumed humility. \nThe greatest greatness and the greatest humility go hand in hand naturally and without \neffort. \nWhen the greatest of all says, \"I am the greatest,\" it is but a spontaneous expression of an \ninfallible Truth.  The strength of his greatness lies, not in raising the dead, but in his great \nhumiliation when he allows himself to be ridiculed, persecuted and crucified at the hands of \nthose who are weak in flesh and spirit. Throughout the ages, humanity has failed to fathom \nthe true depth of the humility underlying the greatness of the Avatar, gauging his divinity by \nits acquired limited religious standards. Even real saints and sages, who have some \nknowledge of the Truth, have failed to understand the Avatar's greatness when faced with \nhis real humility. \nAge after age history repeats itself when men and women, in their ignorance, limitations \nand pride, sit in judgment over the God-incarnated man who declares his Godhood, and \ncondemn him for uttering the truths they can not understand. He is indifferent to abuse and \npersecution for, in his true compassion He understands, in his continual experience of \nreality he knows, and in his infinite mercy he forgives. \nGod is all.  God knows all, and God does all. When the Avatar proclaims he is the Ancient \nOne, it is God who proclaims his manifestation on earth. When man utters for or against the \nAvatarhood it is God who speaks through him.  It is God alone who declares himself through \nthe Avatar and mankind. \nI tell you all with my Divine authority, that you and I are not \"we,\" but \"one.\" You \nunconsciously feel my Avatarhood within you; I consciously feel in you what each of you \nfeel. Thus every one of us is Avatar, in the sense that everyone and everything is everyone \nand everything, at the same time, and for all time. \nThere is nothing but God. He is the only reality, and we all are one in the indivisible oneness \nof this absolute reality. When the one who has realized God says, \"I am God., you are God, \nand we are all one,\" and also awakens this feeling of oneness in his illusion bound selves, \nthen the question of the lowly and the great, the poor and the rich, the humble and the \nmodest, the good and the bad, simply vanishes. It is his false awareness of duality that \nmisleads man into making illusory distinctions and filing them into separate categories. \nI repeat and emphasize that in my continual and eternal experience of reality, no difference \nexists between the worldly rich and the poor. But, if ever such a question of difference \nbetween opulence and poverty were to exist for me, I would deem him really poor who, \npossessing worldly riches, possesses not the wealth of love for God. And, I would know him \ntruly rich who, owning nothing, possesses the priceless treasure of his love for God.  His is \nthe poverty that kings could envy, and that makes even the King of kings his slave. \nKnow therefore, that in the eyes of God, the only difference between the rich and the poor is \nnot of wealth and poverty, but in the degrees of intensity and sincerity in the longing for \nGod. \nLove for God alone can annihilate the falsity of the limited ego, the basis of the life \nephemeral. It alone can make one realize the reality of one's unlimited ego, the basis of \neternal existence. The divine ego, as the basis of eternal existence, continually expresses \nItself; but, shrouded in the veil of ignorance, man misconstrues his indivisible ego and \nexperiences and expresses it as the limited, separate ego. \nPay heed when I say with my divine authority, that the oneness of reality is so \nuncompromisingly unlimited and all-pervading that not only \"We are one,\" but even this \ncollective term of \"we\" has no place in the infinite indivisible oneness. \nAwaken from your ignorance, and try at least to understand that in the uncompromisingly \nindivisible oneness, not only is the Avatar God, but also the ant and the sparrow, just as one \nand all of you are nothing but God. The only apparent difference is in the states of \nconsciousness. The Avatar knows that that which is a sparrow is not a sparrow, whereas the \nsparrow does not realize this, and, being ignorant of its ignorance, identifies itself as a \nsparrow. \nLive not in ignorance. Do not waste your precious life-span in differentiating and judging \nyour fellow-men, but learn to long for the love of God. Even in the midst of your worldly \nactivities, live only to find and realize your true identity with your beloved God. \nBe pure and simple, and love all because all are one.  Live a sincere life; be natural, and be \nhonest with yourself. \nHonesty will guard you against false modesty and will give you the strength of true humility. \nSpare no pains to help others. Seek no other reward than the gift of divine love. Yearn for \nthis gift sincerely and intensely, and I promise in the name of my divine honesty, that I will \ngive you much more than you yearn for. \nI give you all my blessing that the spark of my divine love may implant in your hearts the \ndeep longing for love of God. \n12 September 1954, at a mass darshan \nat Wadia Park, Ahmednagar, \n\"Meher Baba's Call\" PL \nOther versions: Aw 2:2 p2-5, GG6 p99-102 \nIt is very difficult to grasp the entire meaning of the word 'Avatar.' For mankind, it is easy \nand simple to declare that the Avatar is God, and that it means that God becomes man. But \nthis is not all that the word 'Avatar' means or conveys. \nIt would be more appropriate to say that the Avatar is God, and that God becomes man for \nall mankind, and simultaneously God also becomes a sparrow for all sparrows in creation, \nan ant for all ants in creation, a pig for all pigs in creation, a particle of dust for all dusts in \ncreation, etc., for each and everything that is in creation. \nWhen the five Sadgurus effect the presentation of the divinity of God into illusion, this \ndivinity pervades the illusion in effect, and presents itself in innumerable varieties of forms, \nGross, Subtle and Mental. Consequently, in Avataric periods, God mingles with mankind as \nman, and with the world of ants as an ant, etc. \nBut the man of the world cannot perceive this, and hence simply says that God has become \nman, and remains satisfied with this understanding in his own world of mankind. \n1950s? GS p268-269 \nIn the infinite beyond state of God, which transcends the categories of consciousness as well \nas unconsciousness, there appeared the first initial urge for God to know himself. And with \nthe arising of this initial urge, there was an instantaneous manifestation of infinite \nconsciousness as well as infinite unconsciousness as simultaneous resultants. \nOf these two seemingly opposite but complementary aspects, the infinite consciousness \nplays the role of the Avatar or divine incarnation. The infinite unconsciousness finds its \nexpression through an evolution which seeks to develop full consciousness through time \nprocesses. \nIn the human form, the full consciousness strives to have Self-knowledge and Self-\nrealisation. The first man to realise God as one indivisible and eternal truth was taken up \ninto this realisation by the eternal Avataric infinite consciousness. \nThe Avatar is the first Master of the first God-realised soul. But in God-realisation, the full \nconsciousness of the first Master became fused with the eternally infinite consciousness of \nthe Avatar. Therefore, with the coming down of the first God-realised man, the Avatar \nhimself descended and took an incarnation in his body. So, from the point of view of \nincarnation, the Avatar is the same as the first Master. This first Master had no Master in \nhuman form. But all subsequent Masters have had Masters in the human form to help them \nin Truth-realisation. \nThe first Master could realise God without a Master in human form, whereas the subsequent \nMasters always and invariably need some Master for God-realisation. The reason is simple. \nGod-realisation implies inner poise as well as adequate adjustment with the universe, which \nis the shadow of God, along with everything that it contains. The first Master, who is also the \nfirst incarnation of the Avatar, attained both these things, because it is the very goal of the \ninitial urge seeking fulfillment. He did not have a Master in the human form. \nWith regard to those souls who attain God-realisation subsequently, the two requirements \nstand, viz. inner poise and adequate adjustment with everything in the universe. But there is \none great difference. For example, for the soul who is second in attaining God-realisation, \none of the important factors in his spiritual environment is the existence of a human God-\nrealised soul. Hence, while adjusting himself with everything in the universe, this second \ncandidate for God-realisation is confronted with the problem of adjusting himself to the first \nMaster or God-realised soul who, as we have seen, is indistinguishable from the eternal \nAvatar. \nIn this case, the only adequate adjustment possible is unreserved acceptance of the \nbountiful help which comes from the first Master. Refusal to accept this help is \nmaladjustment to a tremendous factor in the universe, and this prevents God-realisation. \nThis is why the first God-realised person did not need an incarnate Master, while all \nsubsequent Masters inescapably need some Master or Masters in order to realise God. They \ncannot do so by their own independent efforts. \nThe first Master, who got fused with the eternal Avataric infinite consciousness, is the \nMaster of all Masters. Yet, if and when the Avatar takes an incarnation in the human form, \nhe brings upon himself a veil, and this veil has to be removed by some Master or Masters. \nThe veil with which the Avatar descends in the human form is placed upon him by the five \nPerfect Masters who bring him down from his formless being. In the Avataric periods, the \nfive Masters always put this veil upon the infinite consciousness of the Avatar, because if he \nwere to be brought without such a veil into the world of forms, the existing balance between \nreality and illusion would be profoundly disturbed. However, when the five Masters think \nthat the moment is ripe, they remove this veil which they have placed on the Avataric \nconsciousness. From that moment the Avatar consciously starts his role as the Avatar. \nThe incarnation of the Avatar does not take place unless it is precipitated by the five Perfect \nMasters of the cycle. In all of his incarnations except the first, even the Avatar needs a \nMaster in order to come into his own eternal and infinite consciousness. He does not \nbecome an exception to the rule that a touch of a Master is necessary for God-realisation. \nHowever, the touch of a Perfect Master does not necessarily mean physical touch. When we \nsay that we are touched by music, or a poem or a story, the touch has deeper significance. \nFar more truly is this so when it is a question of spiritual touch. In the case of a Master, this \ndeeper spiritual touch is often transmitted through the physical touch. \nEvery time the Avatar descends, he is not necessarily recognised as the Avatar by the \nmasses. He can be recognised as such only by those who are very advanced spiritually. The \nAvatar himself is the least concerned about whether or not he comes to be recognised as \nAvatar by large numbers. He plays thoroughly his role as the Avatar, and his chief work lies \nin the higher invisible spheres of existence. If, however, he appears at a critical or \ntransitional cyclic period, as is often the case, he is hailed by the masses as the Avatar of the \nage. \nThe Avatar is not necessarily recognised and hailed as the Avatar by each and all because he \ncovers himself under a veil for his own spiritual work. This veil, under which he prefers to \nremain hidden, is different from the veil which the five Perfect Masters draw on him while \nbringing him down in the human form. The veil which the Avatar puts on himself can be \nremoved by him at any time, and for any person or persons as he may desire, for the \npurposes of self-revelation or self-communication. \nThe Avatar does not take upon himself the karma of the world, nor does he become bound \nby it. But he takes upon himself the suffering of the world which is the result of its karma. \nHis suffering for the world is vicarious. It does not entail entanglement with the karma of \nthe world. But humanity finds its redemption from its karma through his vicarious \nsufferings, e.g. illness, humiliation, accidents and the like. In his own ways, the Avatar \nunfailingly fulfills his incarnation by giving a spiritual push to his age. \n1956? Be p27-32 \nBeing the Avatar, I have come to awaken mankind, and would like the entire world to come \nto me. \nReal saints are dearest and nearest to my heart. \nPerfect Ones and lovers of God adorn the world, and will ever do so. \nThe physical presence of the Perfect Masters throughout eternity is not necessarily confined \nto any particular or special part of the globe. \nMy salutations to all - the past, present and future Perfect Masters, real saints - known and \nunknown - lovers of God, and to all other beings, in all of whom I reside, whether \nconsciously felt by them or not. \n20 July 1957, India, LC p77 \nThe Avatar Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

There is no need to be, for we are all Avatars.' \n\"This was an instance of his knowing what was in one's mind before one had given \nexpression to it, or even thought of doing so.\" \nCharles Purdom, GM p391 \n\"I once asked Meher Baba, 'Baba, why do you call yourself the Avatar? If you would only say \nthat you are a saint, you would have a very large following today. This is something which \ncomes in the way of man's belief, so why do you call yourself the Avatar?' \n\"Baba said, What else shall I call myself? Do you want me to be dishonest to myself and say \nthat I am not the Avatar? I am the Avatar. I do not mind if I have a following or not.\" \nAdi K. Irani, JT p132 \n(From a public talk by Adi; Baba's words are approximate, \nas Adi remembered them.) \n\"Baba once told us, he gave us this figure: He said that life was like an unending procession \nmarching along. The people at the back have no idea what is happening at the front, or even \nwhere they are going, for that matter. \n\"In this unending procession of humanity, every now and then the God-man, the Ancient \none, the Avatar appears. His appearance is such that those in the front of the ranks stop and \nstare at him. Those just behind crane their heads forward to see what is happening. Those \nbehind them start asking each other, 'What is going on? Why have we stopped?' And those \neven further back don't even realise that the procession has stopped. \n\"You know how it is, you have seen a long procession. Even after the front stops, it is quite \nsome time before the back rows have to halt. And this procession is unending, so the back \nrows never stop moving. They don't even realise that anything has happened at the front of \nthe procession. \n\"Baba said this is what it is like for all of us. Only those in the front are aware of his advent, \nand only those in the very front get to actually see him and be with him. But once they have \nseen him and been with him, the procession ends for them. And then those who were \nbehind them become the front ranks. So the next time the Ancient one returns, they are the \nones who see him and get to be with him.\" \nEruch Jessawala, DH p57-58 \n'MINOR' INCARNATIONS \n\"When we got back, I asked Baba how reincarnations on a low level fit in.

But just as Harun al \nRaschid* was the king and always on the throne, even though he often disguised himself as \na beggar, craftsperson, or even as a thief on account of his work, so an Avatar might \nsometimes take an outwardly lower form, though he is always consciously behind that form \non account of his work.\" \nWalter Mertens, \n3 December 1938, \nAw 21:2 p25 \n*Harun al Raschid of  Baghdad (764-809) was Caliph of the Muslim Abbasid empire from \n786-809, the time of its greatest power and prosperity, and is a legendary hero of the \n'Arabian Nights.' \n\"Every time the Avatar comes, he has long hair.\" \nMehera Irani, M p114 \nFor some past incarnations of the Avatar, see sections on KRISHNA, JESUS CHRIST. \nThe Avatar is also a Perfect Master.

In \nthe near future these individuals will gain the ultimate experience of Truth and knowledge. \nOut of millions of souls, only one becomes Perfect. Perfection entails unimaginable \nhardships and sufferings. The Perfect man can bestow divine consciousness - the experience \nof infinity - upon anyone in the twinkling of an eye. The Perfect man bestows conscious \ndivinity at the right moment upon those who have an age-old connection with him... \nTo acquire the gift of divine knowledge, a person must have a close connection with a \nPerfect Master. It was because of this spiritual relationship between myself and Babajan \nthat she, without my asking, striving or longing for it, bestowed on me the experience of God \nI now have. And it is this intimate spiritual relationship which will make me, in the very \nnear future, share the infinite treasure with twelve of my first disciples. \n26 January 1922, \nMandwa, \nLM2 p337 \nAnother version of the last paragraph: \n\"In spiritual affairs, too, one must have a connection with the Master to receive the highest \nstate of existence. It was this connection with Babajan that gave me the experience in a \nsecond, without any striving or longing for it. And it is the connection again that will make \nme share this infinite treasure among twelve of my Circle in the near future. \nRD p35-36 \nMy every word will come true, but I alone know how, when and where. You will not be able \nto understand them. To talk about and understand such subjects requires special ears and a \ndifferent tongue. \n14 October 1922, \nBombay, \nLM2 p442 \nAnother version: \nThe world is against spirituality, and so against me, as I have so often told you. Don't be \nhasty in forming opinions regarding my words and deeds. My words will prove to be true, \nbut I alone know how, when and where. You will not understand them, because to \nunderstand mystical statements supernatural intelligence is required. \n1922, \nBombay, \nPM p57 \nAnd another version: \nAll my words will come true, but how, where and when, that I alone know. You would not be \nable to understand them. To understand and talk on such subjects, special ears and a \ndifferent tongue are needed. \nSW p111 and RD p108 \nThere will be religious hostilities, riots, wars and natural disasters. These events will cause \nthe shedding of blood of millions of people throughout the world in general, and throughout  \nIndia in particular. But thereafter peace and brotherhood will come back into the world. \nThere will be another world war. It will be much more destructive and extensive than the \none before. Rivers of blood will flow. I will dip my kerchief in that river of blood and tie it \naround my head. Not until the world cries out for God will I give up my silence. \n9 July 1925, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p731 \nThe troubles of the world are due to thinking. Soon I shall take this thinking upon myself, \nwhen my health will, most probably, be seriously affected. This is essential for my future \nworking, which will affect the whole world. \nMarch 1927, \nMeherabad, \nPM p113 \nOf the 56 God-realised souls on earth, the five Perfect Masters are the most important. And \nthe one who is the highest of all is the Avatar, myself. I come every 700 to 1400 years, and it \nis undoubtably a very rare and lucky thing for each of you to have the opportunity of loving \nme individually, since even the Sadgurus long to touch the Avatar physically. \nWhen the world is in the grip of pain, misery, suffering and chaos, I manifest myself. \nSpirituality then reaches its pinnacle, and materialism is at its lowest level. Then again, with \nthe passing of time, spirituality diminishes and materialism increases. From the beginning \nof time, this game has been going on, and it will go on for an eternity. \nI have a law of my own for managing the affairs of the universe. But when I speak, that law \nwill be kept aside, because the spiritual push will be universal. So the law which I have \ncreated for the universe will be set aside. \nBut again the law establishes itself. Then the spiritual power gradually diminishes, and \nmaterialism increases, just like a seesaw. \n(Baba tilted his alphabet board up and down like a seesaw) \nMaterial unrest and chaos will have to reach a climax. Then I shall manifest. When I \nmanifest, spirituality is at its highest. \n3 June 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p944 \nThere will be a terrible war in the future, and it will be more destructive and horrible than \nthe last one. America will play the most important role in it. Millions will die, and the war \nwill be so horrendous that there will not even be time to dispose of the heaps of corpses. It \nwill be then that I manifest myself as the Avatar. \n18 June 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p949 \n... The real reason underlying these communal riots, as well as the general restlessness all \nover the world, is the near approach of the spiritual outburst that occurs at long intervals. It \nwill all end in unity and peace. \nOne feels great disturbance and pain in the abdomen before having an unusually \nsatisfactory motion. It is just like that. These very disturbances are the indication of the \ncoming peace. The combination of Islam, Hinduism and Zoroastrianism in my person is not \na coincidence - it has great significance. \nJuly 1927, \nMeherabad, \nSW p400 \nIndia will have independence, but the reaction of all the agitation will greatly harm the \ncountry. The rashness of modern youth will prove a calamity. Such impudence and \nimpetuosity are greatly harmful to the path of spirituality. \nIn all religions, the beginning of opposition against the priest class is welcome, because at \npresent the priest class is the greatest obstacle in the path of spirituality. The rigid and \ndeep-rooted beliefs and prejudices of age-old customs, rites and rituals, which the priests \nhave inherited and nourished in the name of religion, are intolerable and the greatest \nimpediment. \nSo if the downfall of this junta is brought about, the firmly embedded prejudices and rites \nwill be destroyed. Although there is the risk of people becoming indifferent to God and \nreligion, these can still be revived afterward, once these rotting prejudices are uprooted. \n3 April 1930, \nMeherabad, \nLM4 p1296 \nBe prepared to hear of bloodshed. There will be severe tension between the Hindus and \nMuslims. Antagonism between the higher and lower caste Hindus will prevail. Religious \nfeelings will cause differences between the two communities, resulting in bloodshed. \n10 April 1930, \nTiger Valley, \nPanchgani, \nLM4 p1302 \nGreat upheavals are coming soon throughout the world, particularly in  India. There will be \ngreat tension in  India between the British and the Indians on the one hand, and between \nthe Hindus and the Muslims on the other, resulting in terrible bloodshed and massacres. \nHindus will kill Muslims, the Muslims will kill Hindus, and the British will kill both. \nRivers of blood will flow in India, and there will be corpses everywhere. Civil war will break \nout in India, and all the parties will clash against one another. Nothing but chaos and \nconfusion will reign everywhere. Out of this cry and clamor for independence, quite a new \nsituation will arise, with others intervening and abruptly appearing. \nBesides this violence, a great war will break out and rage between the Western countries -- \nRussia, America, England, Italy, Germany and others. There will be such chaos and \nconfusion throughout the world that not one leader will understand what to do. And out of \nthis confusion and chaos, the Avatar will appear, to guide misguided humanity onto the path \nof peace and prosperity -- toward eternal bliss. \nBut that will take time and require great upheavals throughout the world. These disorders, \ndisturbances and unrest are necessary to make the world turn its face toward spirituality, \nand ensure its future salvation. \n28 May 1930, \nMeherabad, \nLM4 p1314-1315 \nI will come back to America to pour out my love to you, and to spiritualise  America. \nDecember 1931, on the ship S. S. Narkunda \nen route to India from Marseilles \nto Malcolm and Jean Schloss \nThe bird-form enriches (enlightens) consciousness with new experiences since, as a \nfeathered vertebrate, it is capable of flying in the air, and, with the help of its two legs, of \nmaintaining an erect stand in the Gross world. \nMeher Baba, before 1955, GS p31-32 \nThe world will soon realise that neither cults, creeds, dogmas, religious ceremonies, lectures \nand sermons on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, ardent seeking for material welfare or \nphysical pleasures, can ever bring about real happiness -- but that only selfless love and \nuniversal brotherhood can do it. \n1932? Me p5 \nJames Douglas: Is there evil in the world? \nBaba: No, there is nothing like evil. \nDouglas: What do you mean? \nBaba: There is nothing except bliss everywhere. \nDouglas: How could that be? \nBaba: In reality, that is the case. \nDouglas: Then how would you explain the thousand and one evils in the world, such as theft, \nmurder, rape, treachery, dishonesty, immorality, torture? Can these wickednesses not be \nconsidered as evils? \nBaba: Not necessarily. \nDouglas: Then what do you call them? What are these to be considered? \nBaba: They are more or less of a degree of good itself. \nDouglas: Oh God, how wonderful. Why couldn't the poets and metaphysicians have \nexplained it in such a straightforward and intelligible manner? \nBaba: As I have said, there is nothing but bliss in the world. What the world calls evil is an \nextremely lower aspect of good. \nDouglas: Of course, of course. How easy. Why the people of the world cannot understand \nsuch a simple thing is surprising. Could you enlighten us as to when the world will \nunderstand this simple truth? \nBaba: When its angle of vision has changed. \nDouglas: But when? \nBaba: It is going on internally. \nDouglas: Thank God. What do you say about the delicate and dangerous situation the world \nis facing? The world's financial condition today is such that countries are ready to strangle \none another. Restlessness is everywhere. When will this calamitous period end? When will \nthis situation improve? \nBaba: Not until there is a change of heart. \nDouglas: A change of heart? What a sovereign remedy. But when will the heart change? \nBaba: It will start after about a year. \nDouglas: Christ took three years to complete his work. How long will it be for you to \ncomplete your work? \nBaba: Thirty-three years. \n....... \nDouglas: What is your mission? \nBaba: To bring about a spiritual regeneration of mankind, of all, the East and the West. \nDouglas: Have you the confidence to do that, especially in the West? \nBaba: With as much confidence as that which you possess in thinking you are now talking to \nme, and believing that you are doing so. In truth, with this objective, the spiritual \nregeneration of mankind, I have taken this birth. This is the purpose of my taking human \nform. \n9 April 1932, London, \nfrom an interview with James Douglas. \nAn edited version of the interview was published \nApril 10, 1932 in the London Sunday Express. \nLM5 p1557-1564. \nOther versions: \nPM p162-165, GM, Gl \nI intend bringing together all religions and cults, like beads on one string, and to revitalise \nthem for individual and collective needs. This is my mission in the West. The peace and \nharmony that I talk of, and that will settle on the face of this worried world, are not far off. \n10 April 1932, London, \npart of a message to \nParamount News Reel, Me p84 \n(Baba described an experience he had when he was five years old. He saw circles within \ncircles of shining light and brilliant colors, became dazed and fainted.) \nI have the actual experience of it all today, and feel the universe and creation emanating and \nprojecting out of me. I feel all today that which I had a mere sight of then. Creation involves, \nonly to re-evolve again. It is a never-ending game. \nI have explained it all in detail in my book.* Even scientists will be astonished to learn the \nsecrets I have explained there. For these will not be vague talks, but facts that are \nsubstantiated and supported by scientific arguments. It will be the future Bible -- not in the \nliteral sense, but a book of understanding for people of all religions. \n5 May 1932, Lugano, Switzerland, LM5 p1606-1607 \n*The book Baba wrote by hand at Meherabad in 1927-28, which \nhas not yet been published. \nQ. What spiritual work (training) do you suggest for modern Europe? \nBaba: There is existing at the moment a universal dissatisfaction, and an indescribable \nlonging for something that will end this terrible chaos and misery that is startling the world \njust now. I am going to satisfy this craving, and lead the world to real happiness and peace \nby making mankind more introspective, and see more to the inside of things than what they \nhave hitherto been accustomed to. \nQ. Do you help individually or collectively? \nBaba: As a rule Masters help individually according to the temperament and preparedness \nof the aspirant, but this being the Avataric period, i.e. the end of the previous cycle and the \nbeginning of a new one, which occurs every seven or eight hundred years, my spiritual help \nto humanity will be both individual and collective. The period of junction of the old and new \ncycle usually connotes the advent of a Master who rejuvenates and infuses new life and \nmeaning into the old order of things, and besides imparting the highest state of spirituality, \nthe state of oneness with the infinite ocean of bliss, knowledge and power, to the select few, \na general spiritual push is given to the whole universe. \nQ. Do you think a possible spiritual revival (happiness) will be the outcome of individual \neffort, or rather a collective movement of nations (like the great religious movements of the \npast)? Will certain nations achieve it sooner than others, and which? \nBaba: The spiritual revival that you ask about is not very far off, and I am going to bring it \nabout in the near future, utilising the tremendous amount of misapplied energy possessed \nby America for the purpose. Such a spiritual outburst that I visualise takes place every seven \nor eight hundred years, at the end or beginning of a cycle, and it is only the Perfect One who \nhas reached the Christ state of consciousness that can appeal and work so very universally. \nQ. Will you deal with such problems as politics, economics, sex? \nBaba: My working will embrace everything. It will affect and control every phase of life. \nPerfection would fall far short of the ideal if it were to accept one thing and eschew another. \nIn the general spiritual push that I shall impart to the world, problems such as politics, \neconomics and sex, although they have no direct connection with the original theme, will all \nbe automatically solved and adopted; and new values and significance will be attached to \nmatters which appear to baffle the solution at the present moment. \nAll collective movements and religions hinge around one personality, for without this \ncentrifugal force all movements are bound to fail. Societies and organisations have never \nsucceeded in bringing Truth nearer. Perfect Masters impart spirituality by personal contact \nand influence, and the benefit that will accrue to different nations when I bring about the \nspiritual upheaval will largely depend upon the amount of energy each one possesses. The \nmore the energy, however misapplied, the more the response. The Master merely diverts \nthe current in the right direction. \n....... \nQ. Why does one talk in connection with you of performing miracles? Don't you think this \nmay lead people into the most materialistic and cheapest kind of beliefs? \nBaba: In the West I find people very keen on the question of miracles. I must explain that the \nability to perform miracles does not necessarily connote high spirituality. Anyone who has \nattained Perfection and enjoys the Christ consciousness can perform miracles. Healing the \nsick, giving eyes to the blind, or raising the dead to life, is mere child's play to him. Even \nthose who have not become one with the infinite, but are only traversing the planes, can \nperform miracles, and are able to do and undo things. It is not, however, to be understood \nthat spiritual Masters perform miracles in order just to satisfy idle curiousity. Miracles have \ncome to be performed, and will be performed, according to existing circumstances. Masters \nhave sometimes performed miracles when it was intended to give a universal push toward \nspirituality. I shall perform miracles when the time and situation demands it, and not for \nmere sensational mongering. \nQ. Have you been in touch with other Masters spiritually only, or even in physical contact? \nBaba: Yes, I have been in touch with spiritual Masters, even physically, before Realisation. It \nis almost impossible to reach the highest state of consciousness without a Master. It was the \nphysical contact of my Master Hazrat Babajan of Poona, a single kiss on my forehead, that \ngave me the consciousness I now eternally enjoy. I now take orders from no one; it is all my \nsupreme will. Everything is because I will it to be. Nothing is beyond my knowledge. I am in \neverything. There is no time and space for me; it is I who give them their relative existence. I \nsee the past and future as clearly and vividly as you see material things round about you. \nAnswers to questions by Rom Landau, sent him in a letter, \nMay 1932, London, A p37-40 \nAnother version: LM5 p1612 \n(Note: Some of Baba's answers to Rom Landau's questions \nseem to have been incorporated into the following message) \nI am not come to establish any cult, society or organisation, nor even to establish a new \nreligion. \nThe religion I shall give touches* the knowledge of the one behind the many. The book that I \nshall make people read is the book of the heart, which holds the key to the mystery of life. \nAs for ritual, I shall teach humanity to discriminate, express and live, rather than utter it. I \nshall bring about a happy blending of the head and heart. \n* In another version, 'teaches.' \nSocieties and organisations have never succeeded in bringing Truth nearer. Realisation of \nthe Truth is solely the concern of the individual. \nEvery being is a point from which a start could be made towards the limitless ocean of love, \nbliss, knowledge and goodness already with him. \nNo spiritual Master brings religion to the world in the form which it eventually assumes. His \nvery presence is a blessing, and radiates spirituality. He imparts it to others by personal \ncontact. \nThe so-called religions are an effort to commemorate the association with a great spiritual \nMaster, and to preserve his atmosphere and influence. It is like an archeological department \ntrying to preserve things which only resuscitate the past. The living spirit being absent, \nreligions or organisations gradually lose their glamour. The result is a mental revolt against \nthe established order. Something more substantial and practical is required, which \nexpresses the life of the spirit. \nThere exists at the moment a universal dissatisfaction, and an indescribable longing for \nsomething that will end the chaos and misery that is holding the world in its grip. I will \nsatisfy this craving, and lead the world to real happiness and peace, by making people look \nmore into things than hitherto. \nAs a rule, Masters help individually according to temperament and fitness of the aspirant. \nBut this being an Avataric period (which means the end of the previous cycle and the \nbeginning of a new one), my spiritual help to humanity will be both individual and \ncollective. \nThe period of junction of the old and new cycle usually connotes the advent of a Master who \nrejuvenates religious thought, infusing new life and meaning into the old order of things. \nBesides imparting the highest state of spirituality to a select few, he gives a spiritual push to \nthe whole world. \nThe West looks at things only from the standpoint of reason and logic, and is sceptical about \nthings which baffle the intellect. Intellect is the lowest form of understanding, and is \ndeveloped by reading, hearing, reasoning and logic. These processes create an illusion of \nreal knowledge. \nThe higher state of understanding is permanent Illumination, through which one \nexperiences and sees things as they are. In this state, one feels in harmony with everyone \nand everything, and realises divinity in every phase of life, and is able to impart happiness \nto others. Here one attends to all duties and material affairs, and yet feels  mentally \ndetached from the world. This is true renunciation. \nThe last and highest state of understanding is the merging of the soul into the limitless \nocean of infinite bliss, knowledge and power. One who has himself attained this freedom \ncan make thousands Perfect like himself. \nI intend bringing about a great spiritual revival in the near future, utilising the tremendous \namount of energy possessed by America for the purpose. Such a spiritual outpouring that I \nvisualise usually takes place at the beginning or end of a cycle, and only a Perfect one who \nhas reached the Christ state of consciousness can make such a universal appeal. \nMy work will embrace everything. It will permeate every phase of life. Perfection would fall \nfar short of the ideal if it were to accept one thing and eschew another. \nThe general spiritual push that I shall give to the whole world will automatically adjust \nproblems such as politics, economics and sex, though these are not directly connected with \nthe original theme. New values and significance will be attached to things which appear to \nbaffle solution at the moment. \nThe benefits that shall accrue to different nations and countries when I bring about the \nspiritual upheaval, will be largely determined by the amount of energy each one possesses. \nThe greater the energy, however misapplied, the greater the response. The Master merely \ndiverts the current into the right channel. \nIt will be one of my greatest miracles to bring together and blend the realistic West with the \nidealistic East, and the West, at the zenith of its intellectual and material attainment, and the \nEast at the height of its spiritual manifestation in the shape of a Perfect Master, will meet \nwithout shaming or looking down upon each other. \nI repeat, materialism and spirituality must go hand in hand. The balance of head and heart \nmust be maintained (the head for discrimination, the heart for feeling), whereby it is \npossible to realise infinite consciousness in art, science, nature, and every phase of life. \nI have become one with the infinite source of everything. This is the state of Christ-\nconsciousness. If people call me messiah, saviour or redeemer, it does not affect me. Terms \nand names do not matter. What really matters is the state of Christ-consciousness that I \neternally enjoy, and towards which I shall lead all who come to me. \nWhen I speak, my original message will be delivered to the world, and it will have to be \naccepted. \nThe ability to perform miracles does not necessarily connote high spirituality. Anyone who \nhas reached the Christ-consciousness can perform them. People must not come to me \nmerely for help in their physical infirmities, or for material purposes. I shall perform \nmiracles when the time and situation demand, and not to satisfy mere idle curiousity. \nSpiritual healing is by far the greatest healing, and this is what I intend to give. The highest \nis latent in everyone, but has to be manifested. \n19 May 1932, New York, \na printed message given \nto reporters who came on board the ship Bremen, Me p84-87 \nOther versions: PM p165-168, \nLM5 p1616-1618 \n... I do not intend to found any religion, cult, creed or society. There are already far too many \nof these organisations. I have come to help people realise their ideals in daily life... \nAmerica represents the vanguard and the synthesis of the white races, and hence forms the \nbest foundation for the spiritual upheaval I will bring about in the near future. America has \ntremendous energy, but most of this energy is misdirected. I intend to divert it into spiritual \nand creative channels. \nI am now going to California for a few days. From there, I must go to the Far East for one day \nfor spiritual reasons. But I will be back in California by the end of June, and then I will speak \non June 29th. But if I should be delayed, I will return on July 12th and speak on July 13th. \nWhen I speak, there will be many proofs of my spiritual power, and of my ability to bestow \nIllumination. People will then realise that Truth, which is the source of all love and \nexistence, rules supreme in all departments of life. \nMy work and aims are intensely practical. It is not practical to over-emphasise the material \nat the cost of the spiritual. It is not practical to have spiritual ideals without putting them \ninto practice. But to realise the ideal in daily life, to give a beautiful and adequate form to \nthe living spirit, to make brotherhood a fact - not merely a theory as at present - this is being \npractical in the  truest sense of the word. \nMy work will arouse both great enthusiasm and a certain amount of opposition. That is \ninevitable. But spiritual work is strengthened by opposition, and so it will be with mine. It is \nlike shooting an arrow from a bow. The more you pull the bow string towards you, the \nswifter the arrow speeds to its goal. \nmessage read out at a reception at 88 Grove Street, Me p88-90 \nOther versions: PM p169-171, \nLM5 p1626-1627 \nI eternally enjoy the Christ state of consciousness, and when I speak, which I intend doing in \nthe near future, I shall manifest my true self. Besides giving a spiritual push to the whole \nworld, I shall lead all those who come to me towards light and Truth. This, in short, is my \nmission in the world. \n29 May 1932, \nHollywood, part of a message \nto reporters, Me p93 \nAlso PM p174 and LM5 p1644 \nQ. What do you hope to accomplish in the  United States? \nBaba: A general spiritual awakening which will affect the whole of mankind, and will \neliminate depression and dissatisfaction existing in the world today. \n30 May 1932, \nLos Angeles, \ninterview \nwith a reporter, \nLM5 p1648 \nI intend, when I speak, to reveal the one supreme self which is in all. This accomplished, the \nidea of the self as a limited, separate entity will disappear, and with it will vanish self-\ninterest. Cooperation will replace competition. Certainty will replace fear. Generosity will \nreplace greed. Exploitation will disappear... \nIn order to convey thought to others, man uses speech or writing, or some other physical \nmeans of expression. Or in some cases, as in telepathy, thought is transmitted and received \nthrough and by the Subtle body. \nThe God-man does not convey thought, but Truth, which he either awakens in the individual \nwhom he is helping through deep inner experience, or which he transmits directly from the \nsuperconscious to the conscious, from the spiritual to the physical, by means of either the \nphysical eye, the physical touch, or the spoken word. \nWhen he speaks, Truth is more powerfully manifested than when he uses either sight or \ntouch to convey it. For that reason, Avataras usually observe a period of silence lasting for \nseveral years, breaking it to speak only when they wish to manifest the Truth to the entire \nuniverse. So when I speak, I shall manifest the divine will, and a worldwide transformation \nof consciousness will take place. \n31 May 1932, \nHollywood, \npart of a message read out \nat a reception at \nthe Knickerbocker Hotel \nMe p95 \n.... The depression is not an accident, nor is it purely the result of overproduction and \ninflation. Those, although the immediate causes, are merely the instruments which were \nused to bring the depression about. The depression itself was caused by those entrusted \nwith the evolution of humanity. \nMan has to be stripped of his material possessions in order that he may realise, through \nactual experience, that his true base is spiritual and not material. Then he will be ready to \nreceive the Truth which I have come to bring. \nThis Truth consists in the knowledge that man, instead of being a limited, separate \nindividual, completely bound by the illusion of time and space and substance, is eternal in \nhis nature, and infinite in his resources. The world-illusion is a dream of his imagination, a \nplay enacted in the theatre of his consciousness, a comedy of which he is at once author, \nproducer, director, star. But his absorption in the role which he has chosen to enact has \nmade him forgetful of his true self, and he stumbles now as creature through the part he has \ncreated. \nHe must be awakened to his true nature. He must see that all material expression depends \nupon and flows from spiritual being. Then he will be steadfast and serene under all \ncircumstances. There will be no further need, then, for the depression, and it will \ndisappear... \n1 June 1932, \nBeverly Hills, California, \npart of a message read out at a \nreception at Pickfair, \nMe p98-99 \nScientists cannot go beyond space. What is beyond is infinite. Only where space exists is \nheight of material power. \nThe movies will undergo great changes. The actors, when they get and feel (from the inner \nplane), then that feeling which no scientist can control will be felt intellectually by the \naudience. \nBut then the time will come for this world to disintegrate. One of the inventions will be \nwhen one can shoot another at a distance of a thousand miles. \nVery soon people will be smaller with bigger heads, and all flying about with machines. \nThey will talk less, as they will read each other's minds. \nIt is all nothing, only love and one existence. \nundated, from Elizabeth Patterson's diary, \nHM p654 \nQ. Why do you not bring the salvation now? \nBaba: Yes, I know. The world needs it very badly. But still there is a need for some of its \ngreater evils to be eradicated, and then it will be very soon. I know it because I work it out. \nQ. Will salvation be felt by anybody and everybody? \nBaba: Mostly by all, but in degrees. To some more, to others less. But it will be a universal \nspiritual push. \n1934, Zurich, Switzerland, A p9 \nThe internal spiritual message of love will reach every heart. Because it is the same infinite \none in the Swiss, in the German, as in all peoples. It should be unlocked and opened. My love \nwill do that. \n1934, \nZurich, Switzerland, \nA p19 \nThe knowledge that all have the same beginning and the same end, with life on earth a \nhappy interlude, will go a long way in making the brotherhood of man a reality on earth. \nAnd this, in turn, will strike at the root of narrow communalism and rigid exploitation. \nFebruary 1937, \nNasik, \nMe p9 \nThe present world chaos is the beginning of spiritual manifestation. To illustrate: If a man \ndevelops a cataract in his eye, the cataract raises a curtain over his vision, and he cannot see \nproperly. The only remedy is to remove the curtain, which means an operation by an eye \nspecialist. But not before the doctor sees that the cataract is ripe enough for the operation - \notherwise, he allows it to grow ripe. \nSimilarly, the present chaotic condition of the world is due to materialism, which has \ndeveloped self-interest and greed in mankind, raising a curtain which obstructs spiritual \nvision and development. It has grown so bad now as to create chaos all over the world, a \nclear indication that the cataract is ripe, and ready for the operation. \nThe operation over, the disease of ignorance, greed and lust will be removed, and the \nspiritual vision of the world will once again be restored. The doctor - Master is ready for the \noperation, awaiting only the ripening of the cataract. \n1937, \nNasik, \nAw 10:2 p40 \nChaos and destruction are essential for reconstruction. It is the spiritual law - create and \ndestroy. Create chaos, confusion and misery - then destroy it, so that it may all be built \nanew. How can an old house be rebuilt unless it is demolished? \n26 September 1937, \nCannes, France, \nto Mr. Siebert, \nLM7 p2224 \nAvataric periods are like the springtide of creation. They bring a new release of power, a \nnew awakening of consciousness, a new experience of life, not merely for a few, but for all. \nQualities of energy and awareness, which had been used and enjoyed by only a few \nadvanced souls, are made available for all humanity. Life as a whole is stepped up to a \nhigher level of consciousness, is geared to a new rate of energy. The transition from \nsensation to reason was one such step. The transition from reason to intuition will be \nanother... \nThe wave of destruction must rise still higher, must spread still further. But when, from the \ndepths of his heart, man desires something more lasting than wealth, something more real \nthan material power, the wave will recede. Then peace will come, joy will come, light will \ncome. \n1938? Di v1 p3-4, 6 \nConditions in the world are going from bad to worse, and the outbreak of war is definite. \nEverything will be chaotic, and millions will die. It will not be due to hate and hostility \nbetween mankind, but will be due to I-ness. It is all a divine game. \nApril 1938, \nBangalore \nto Eruch Jessawala, \nLM7 p2282 \nIn January 1939 Meher Baba was questioned by a reporter from the Associated Press. This \nis part of the interview: \nReporter: How long will the present chaotic state of affairs continue in the world? \nBaba: As long as selfishness exists, because it is the root cause. In all this chaos and \nconfusion my work is done. It is a cleaning process. \n... \nReporter: What is your holiness' opinion about Mahatma Gandhi? \nBaba: He is a great and noble soul, and trying to serve humanity with all his heart. \nReporter: When do you think India will be given its' independence? \nBaba: When the Hindus and Muslims cease quarreling. \nReporter: Will the Jews, the most oppressed nation in the world today, be able to withstand \nthe onslaught that is being perpetrated on them by Hitler and Mussolini? \nBaba: Jews or not Jews, whosoever sticks to the Truth, or is on the side of Truth, can \nwithstand any onslaught. \nReporter: Will your holiness kindly give me a message that I may broadcast to the world? \n(Baba repeated an explanation he had given previously.) \n\"When suffering leads to real, eternal happiness, we should not attach importance to this \nsuffering. It is to eliminate suffering that suffering has to be. People suffer because they are \nnot satisfied. They want more and more. Ignorance gives rise to greed and vanity. If you \nwant nothing, would you then suffer? But you do want. If you did not want anything, you \nwould not suffer, even in the jaws of a lion. \n\"The widespread dissatisfaction in modern life is due to the gulf between theory and \npractise, between the ideal and its realisation on Earth. The spiritual and material aspects of \nlife are widely separated instead of being closely united. There is no fundamental \nopposition between spirit and matter, or, if you like, between life and form. The apparent \nopposition is due to wrong thinking - to ignorance. \n\"The best and also the easiest way of overcoming the ego and attaining divine \nconsciousness is to develop love and render selfless service to all humanity in whatever \ncircumstances we may be placed. All ethics and religious practices lead to this. The more we \nlive for others, the less we live for ourselves, and thus the more debased desires are \neliminated. This in turn reacts upon the ego, supressing it and transforming it \nproportionately \n\"The root of all our difficulties, individual and social, is self-interest. Eliminate self-interest \nand you will solve all your problems -- individual and social. \n\"The world will soon realise that neither cults, creeds, dogmas, religious ceremonies, \nlectures and sermons, on the one hand, nor on the other hand ardent seeking for material or \nphysical pleasures, can ever bring about real happiness. Only selfless love and universal \nbrotherhood can bring happiness.\" \n9 January 1939, \nJabalpur, \nLM7 p2362-2363 \nEngland and France are weak. They are not firm enough. Now  America is strong. \nThe Prime Minister* has made a broadcast. He is a thorough gentleman, and noble, and no \nmatch for these rogues.** The German head*** is mad. No one but a madman could have \ndone what he did to the Jews. \nBut it all had and has to happen. It is nobody's fault. It is all just right. \nIt is like a game of chess - they are the figures, and I play the game. \nThe last war was not good enough. They were too tired to fight any more, and so they made \nup. But the coming war will remove many factors of mischief, and there will be real \nfriendship. \nMeher Baba, \n26 January 1939, Agra, \nGl Aug 1996 p12-13 \n* of England \n** Hitler and Mussolini \n*** Hitler \nMysore will surely realise, at no distant date, its singular good fortune in possessing, \namongst many progressive features, the spiritual capital of the world as well. \n17 December 1939, \nByramangala, \nBangalore, \nMe p10 \nBaba: You should write down all my statements about the war, and have them printed and \ndistributed. \nGhani (smiling): What effect will a booklet have? It doesn't look proper to distribute \nbooklets when you are the Avatar. \nBaba: If the Avatar has to resort to distributing leaflets, it shows the shocking condition \npeople have come to. Yet I have to do it. It is the preliminary preparation. This is the \nbeginning. I'm preparing the ground. You are fools. This war was preceded by \ncorrespondence. Meetings were held. Thereafter, there were protests and opposition. Then \nwhen the war started, and all these were of no avail, the bombs came. \nSo these explanations of mine about the war are a sort of communication, to give the public \na chance to listen and improve. If they won't, then there will be spiritual bombs. Don't you \nknow me after so many years of contact? One who does not care for the world, and publicly \ndeclares in America, 'I will come here and speak,' and does not - don't you understand him \nyet? I do not care what the world will think or say. I will do anything for the sake of my \nwork. Even if the whole world goes against me, I will do what I have to do.  But all in its \ntime. I will teach and strike, both. \nBut India nowadays is sadly lacking in spirituality, by indulging in too much politics and \nmaya. The old spiritual glory is gone. It is sad, yet it is a fact. \nDecember 1939, \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2484-2485 \nIf Italy joins the war, there will be world war. There will be utter destruction and chaos, just \nas I want. Then people will feel the hollowness, the emptiness of it all, and turn to God. Since \nI am in India,  India will suffer a great deal also. \n10 June 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2565 \nThere has never been such a war, and never will be another like it. But when this is over, \npeace will reign for 400 years. From this mass destruction, I will build life anew, and quite \ndifferent from now, much happier, better. All who die in this war will take form again, and \nenjoy this peace. \n11 June 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2565 \nThe present world crisis, chaos, and the universal suffering are absolutely necessary for the \neventual spiritual upliftment and for a new world, wherein peace, love and divine \naspirations will reign supreme. None should therefore feel scared and dismayed, bearing in \nmind the certainty of this bright future... \nSo this apparent world catastrophe is, by divine will, essential for a divine manifestation of \nlove and real peace in the near future, in which I have to play the greatest part. \nMeher Baba's Universal Message for \nthe Future, 21 June 1940 (pamphlet) \nAfter August of this year, conditions will worsen. Developments in the war will take a \nserious turn, become complicated, and the flames will spread far and wide until the war will \nembrace not only the whole of the West, but also the East. \nBesides, a time will come when people will even forget the war and the terrible destruction \nit has caused in life and property, for there will be further disasters, more voracious in their \ndestructive power, like plagues and pestilences, fire and famine, floods and earthquakes of \nimmense magnitude and force, all of which will take more toll of life and property than \nmachine guns and bombs. \nThen, too, civil wars will complicate the political situations among nations, and make things \neven more chaotic, until it will create a deadlock. Even millionaires will be starving for food. \nThere will be chaos everywhere and all will be helpless. \n6 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nLM7 p2574 \nThe conditions that prevail in the world today are the cause of its suffering. But this misery \nand suffering are not for emancipation. Only love can achieve that... \nHow does this all work? We are all nations. Each one of you represents a nation. Mansari is a \nsmall nation, Nadine is a big nation, and so on. Each one, according to her greatness or \nsmallness, her greed, her longing for power and possessions, tries diplomatically to get \nwhat she wants. But when one loses in war, one tries to get into the next war. The mentality \nis like that. \nFor example, what will you fight with?  With arms. The only solution for it is to cut off \neverybody's arms. Then they will find themselves armless, and come to the conclusion that \nthis armlessness has come about because of their showing the strength of their arms. Then \nthey will promise each other from the bottom of their hearts to maintain weapons, but \nnever to use them on each other. Then they help each other and become like members of \none family. This is what is being done. All will be exhausted, just go limp. No one wins, no \none loses; all will be half dead. There was never such a war... \nReligion has to go, and God has to come - definitely. Gandhi tells Britain to be non-violent; to \nlet Germany take over England, to let themselves be killed, to be destroyed and not to fight. \nWhat he says is 100% right and true, but absolutely impossible and impractical. Hitler and \nGandhi are both right in their way of thinking, according to their own conceptions, but both \nare stark mad to think so. Both are extremes. Extreme violence, when it reaches the zenith, \nbecomes non-violence, and vice versa... \nThe world will never be non-violent. It will always be more than non-violence, and more \nthan non-violence is love. Non-violence means eternal resistance to the longing to retaliate. \nLove needs no efforts. It is different from resistance to longing. Love demands self-control \nand spontaneous happiness for the beloved. This effort is necessary for love, but it is not \ndry. Non-violence is not the self-control that is needed in love; it is a continuous resistance \nto the longing to retaliate. One is effort for transformation, the other is an effort for \nrepression... \n7 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nto his women disciples, \nLM7 p2579-2580 \nKill to defend without hate. France will hate England. Of what use is democracy if it cannot \nhelp? So neither it nor totalitarianism will remain. Both will go... \n8 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nLM7 p2580 \nEngland will find it very difficult to find food. They will all starve. They will eat rats, bats, \ncats and even old men and women - mark my words. \n12 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nLM7 p2588 \nEngland will be worse than defeated, it will be made helpless. But it will be a good world \nlater when, just as we saw in the circus the other night when the lion, goat, and cow all ate \ntogether out of the same plate - the Germans, Indians and English will all eat out of one plate \n- with no trainer, but with my help. \n16 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nLM7 p2589 \nBaba had an article prepared on the war. He came to the women's quarters and had it read \naloud. All liked it, but one commented that science should not have been mentioned in it. \nBaba explained: \n\"Science must arise, as it plays a great part in the present war. Science can be put to good \nuse, and science can be put to bad use. Chloroform can be used for operations, for healing. \nBut robbers also use it on their victims to steal things. In war, science is used for \ndestruction. But destruction ultimately means renewal and improvement. What happened \nwhen they burned London during the Black Plague? They rebuilt it later, and it was better \nthan before. \n\"So when the world is destroyed, a new and better world must spring up from the ashes. \nThere will be chaos and destruction all over the universe. But after that there will be no war \nfor 800 years. Therefore, isn't all this present misery worth that long period of happiness? \nThose who die in this war will be reborn to enjoy the new world and peace. Now they want \npower and possessions and hate each other. \n\"How can it all end? In only one way. They must get sick of it all, sick of wanting, sick of \nhating, sick of fighting. \n\"Suppose you like milk, and you drink and drink it, so excessively that eventually you get \nsick of it. Then what do you do? You stop drinking milk. In the same way, hate, greed, anger \nand so forth will reach such a height that everyone will be simply sick of it all. And then \nwhat will the alternative be? To stop hating and to love, to stop wanting and to give, to stop \nfighting and be at peace. The world of the future will be very marvelous.\" \nOne of the women said: 'But it is all zero.' \nBaba nodded and continued: \"Yes, but this is a supreme understanding. Even the present is \nall zero, and therefore the future of zero can be nothing but zero. It is all zero. Nothing exists \nbut God. One day, my nearest disciples will realise it. Now the most you can do is to think, \n'Yes, nothing exists, all is zero.' But when you realise it you will feel it.\" \n11 October 1940, \nMeherabad, to \nhis women Mandali, \nLM7 p2621 \nEvery sound you make, every thought you think, good or bad, stays... \nAll this noise of guns, bombs and airplanes, etc., of war, will be utilised for the spiritual life \nof the world in the future. Yes, it all stays. It cannot go. Where can it go? It is like water \nwhich evaporates, forms into clouds, and then comes down again as rain. \n11 October 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2621 \nAll are killing one another now. From March onwards, it will increase. Besides killing, there \nwill be floods, earthquakes, fires, famine and diseases - all of which will take a great toll. \nNature killing them, and themselves killing each other. And God does all this. Why? \nThe root of the evil is so deep-rooted that unless drastic and worldwide remedies are \napplied, it cannot be uprooted. It has to be knocked from every side, and then only can it be \nexterminated. Then real peace and happiness will be permanent. It will be automatically \nestablished. People will then learn to love one another, to help one another. \nHow is it possible for the greatest sinners to become saints? Because their penance is so \ndrastic and complete. The transmutation is real and full. \nThe world is miserable. And India, too, is miserable, although not directly involved in the \nwar. \n24 January 1941, \nJaipur, to his women Mandali, \nLM7 p2656 \nAmerica will play a very great part in the battle of humanity in the future. \nMeher Baba, \n15 March 1941, \nQuetta, \nLM7 p2682 \nThe breaking of my silence will also be as sudden and unexpected as the passing away of \nUpasani Maharaj. The difference will, however, be in the general feeling, which will be very \nstrong when I speak. All will feel it. It will shake the world like an earthquake. People will \nfeel the shock in different degrees in different parts of the world. Thus they will experience \nit in different ways. \n23? December 1941, \nto Gulmai Irani, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p2745 \nTwo kinds of forces are operative in the present war: \n1. The forces which make for love, justice, harmony and the well-being of mankind, taken as \na whole, and \n2. The forces which, in alliance with narrow racial or national loyalties, work towards the \nselfish exploitation of others. \nThis war is bringing a vast amount of suffering and destruction to millions of people. But all \nthis will not be in vain. Out of this chaos there will emerge a new world of freedom and \nhappiness and understanding. \nWar can at best be only a means to an end. It can never be an end in itself. It is therefore \nimperatively necessary for the war lords to search their own hearts, and to make sure that \nthe ends for which they are fighting are a reflection of the divine plan, which is to lead \nhumanity to a spiritual brotherhood cemented by an inviolable sense of the unity of all \nhuman beings, irrespective of the distinctions based on class, color, nationality, race, \nreligion or creed. \nWar effort will be justified or stand condemned, not by the results which it produces, but by \nthe ends by which it is inspired. The world has to face this war and go through its ordeal of \nfire, even at the cost of irreparable damage and unredeemable suffering. It is a necessary \nevil. \nEven in itself, war is not an unmixed evil, since it calls forth and releases, under the stress of \nimminent danger, much action which is regardless of the limited self, and which is inspired \nby the impersonal spirit of welcoming sacrifice and suffering for the safety and prosperity of \nfellow-beings. \nIt is better that such unselfish action be released under the stimulus of danger than that it \nshould not be released at all. It is better that men should forget their petty selves under the \npressure of a collective calamity than that they should be permanently encased in the \nignoble pursuit of personal safety, and in the ruthless attempt to perpetuate separative \nexistence and interests. \nWar-effort generates and fosters many qualities of spiritual importance. It is therefore not \naltogether without spiritual significance, even when it is considered in itself. And when war-\neffort is forced upon a nation or a people for the sake of higher values and impersonal \nconsiderations of general well-being, it becomes not only spiritually defensible but \ninevitable. \nPeople ought to face the incidents of war with courage and equanimity, in the faith that no \nsacrifice or suffering is too much when the call of duty is clear and imperative. In the event \nof a direct and aggressive attack, the clear duty of all is to resist it, even by direct \nparticipation in war, if there is no other alternative. \nBut in offering such resistance, they shall make sure that they are prompted solely by the \nsense of duty, and that they have no hatred or bitterness towards the aggressor, who is \nacting out of spiritual ignorance. Further, they shall not be callous to the physical and \nmental suffering inflicted by air raids or warfare on land or sea. On the contrary, they shall \nrender to the wounded and desolate victims of war every possible service, according to \ntheir individual ability and aptitude... \nAs a rule, spiritual aspirants are indifferent to purely material well-being. They are prone to \nbe indifferent to war, as well as war-effort, on the ground that most wars are actuated by \npurely material considerations. But it is a mistake to divorce spirituality from material \nconsiderations. Material considerations do have a spiritual aspect and importance. Even \nspiritual aspirants, who are wrapped up in the supersensible realities of inner life, can ill \nafford to ignore war, particularly when they are directly involved in it. Spiritual aspirants \ntake their stand upon the reality and the eternity of the infinite soul. It should therefore be \neasy for them to stake everything for the sake of a duty which springs from the claims of the \nspirit... \nThe soul remains untouched and unscathed by the loss and destruction of material things \nand possessions, and death is only a gateway to further life. Those who would play their \npart in the divine game shall remain unmoved by any bereavements or losses, and they shall \nalso impart to others the spirit of cheerful resignation to the divine will. The un-understood \nsufferings of war will embitter many souls. They need to be helped in the restoration of \nunassailable faith and imperishable sweetness of life. Those who are initiated into the \neternal values of inner life shall bear the burden of dispelling unwarranted gloom and \ndepression, and cheer up those who are in anguish. \nIn the hour of trial, let the thought of everyone be not for the limited self, but for others - not \nfor the claims of the ego-life, but for the claims of the divine self, which is equally in all. It is \na mistake to ignore human suffering as merely a part of the illusory universe. Not by \nignoring human suffering, but by handling it with creative love, is the gateway opened for \nlife eternal. And not through callous indifference, but through active and selfless service, is \nsecured the attainment of that transcendental and illimitable Truth which is at the heart of \nthe illusory universe. \nThe last but not the least duty of those who would stand by reason and love, is to see war as \nwell as war effort in the right perspective, as being only the means for the goal of peace and \nunderstanding. It is not possible to justify war apart from the end which is sought through \nit. War does not stand justified merely by the spiritual qualities which it generates and \nfosters; these qualities can also be developed in times of peace. It is time that humanity is \nimbibed by the spontaneous spirit of love and service, needing no stimulus of danger for the \nrelease of impersonal and unselfish action. \nThough it seems difficult, humanity has to emerge out of this dreadful war with unimpaired \nspiritual integrity, with hearts free from the poison of malice or revenge, with minds \ndisburdened of the blows given or received, with souls unscathed by suffering and filled \nwith the spirit of unconditional surrenderance to the divine will, which shall ensoul and \ninspire postwar humanity. In spite of its attendant evils, this war shall play its part in my \nmission of helping humanity to fulfill the divine plan on earth, and to inherit the coming era \nof truth and love, of peace and universal brotherhood, of spiritual understanding and \nunbounded creativity... \nIn short, all should face the impending crisis, however painful and cruel it may turn out to \nbe, with patience, fortitude and self-sacrifice, never for a moment forgetting the fact that the \nredemption of distracted humanity through divine love is very much nearer at hand than \nmany care to believe. \nFebruary 1942, \nMe p26-33, \nalso LM8 p2773-2778 \n... The various streams of culture which have poured into the life-history of India have \nadded to the wealth of her national personality. And they have not only created a suitable \nopportunity for arriving at a new cultural synthesis, but have necessitated its emergence. If \nhandled with creative leadership, the presence of conflicting elements in Indian life can be \nutilised for bringing into existence a rich world culture, which shall not only rejuvenate and \nharmonise Indian life, but will also give a new tone to the life of the whole world. \nThe process by which we arrive at the new world culture cannot be purely mechanical. We \ncan never have any vigorous world culture by merely piling together certain isolated \nelements selected from the present diversity of culture. That way we shall only succeed in \ngetting a patchwork of little vitality. A hotchpotch of collected ideas can never be a \nsubstitute for a direct and fresh perception of the goal. The new world culture will have to \nemerge from an integral vision of the Truth, independently of existing traditions, and not \nfrom the laborious process of selection and compilation of conserved values. \nThe new world culture which will emerge from integral vision will, however, automatically \nbring about cultural synthesis. Since the vision that inspires the new world culture will be \ncomprehensive, it will not negate the values of diverse traditions; nor will it have merely \npatronising tolerance for them. On the contrary, it shall express itself through active \nappreciation of the essentials of diverse religions and cultures. \nThe vast vision of the Truth cannot be limited by any creed, dogma or sect. However, it \nhelps man to transcend these limitations, not by blind and total denial of any value to the \nexisting creeds, dogmas and sects, but by discovering, accentuating, unfolding and \ndeveloping such facets of the Truth as might have been hidden in them... \nHuman evolution proceeds by gradual stages from selfish violence to unselfish violence, and \nthen from non-violence of the brave to the pure and incorruptible non-violence of Truth as \ninfinite love. \nAll narrowness limits love. In India, as well as in every other part of the world, humanity is \nbreaking itself into narrow groups based upon the superficial, and ultimately false, \ndifferences of caste, creed, race, nationality, religion or culture. And since these groups have \nbeen long accustomed to separative distrust and fear, they have indifference, contempt or \nhostility towards each other. \nAll this is due to ignorance, prejudice and selfishness. And it can only be mended by \nfostering the spirit of mutuality, which breaks through artificial isolationism, and which \nderives its strength from the sense of the inviolable unity of life as a whole. \nCreative leadership (which has so much scope in the soil of India) will have to recognise and \nemphasise the fact that all men are already united with each other, not only by their co-\npartnership in the great divine plan for Earth, but also by virtue of their all being equally the \nexpression of one life. No line of action can be really helpful or fruitful unless it is in entire \nharmony with this deep truth. The future of humanity is in the hands of those who have \nvision. \nFebruary 1942, \nIndia, \nMe p37-41 \nAnother version: \nLM8 p2783-2785 \nGod's plan is always for the best, and although at times things appear to be going wrong, in \nfact it is not so. \n30 March 1942, \nDehra Dun, \nLM8 p2782 \nThis war is a necessary evil. It is in God's plan, which is to awaken humanity to higher \nvalues. If humanity fails to profit by the lessons of war, it will have suffered in vain. \nThis war is teaching that even the man in the street can rise to the greatest heights of \nsacrifice for the sake of a selfless cause. And it is also teaching that all the mundane things of \nthe world - wealth, possessions, power, fame, family, and even the very tenor of life on earth \n- are transitory, and devoid of lasting value. \nThe incidents of war shall, through the lessons which they bring, win over man for God, who \nis the Truth. And they will initiate him into a new life which is inspired by true and lasting \nvalues. People are making unlimited sacrifices and enduring untold sufferings for the sake \nof their country or political ideology. They are therefore capable of the same sacrifices and \nendurance for the sake of God or the Truth. \nAll religions have unequivocally claimed man for the life in the Truth; and it is sheer folly to \nfight in the name of religions. It is time that man had a fresh vision of the truth that all life is \none, and that God is the only thing which is real and the only thing that matters. God is \nworth living for, and he is also worth dying for. All else is a vain and empty pursuit of \nillusory values. \n27 December 1942, \nMeherabad, \nMe p49, \nalso Di v5 p1 \nSpiritual freedom has to be won by oneself for oneself through watchful and unfailing war \nagainst the lower self and the lower desires. Those who would be the soldiers in the cause \nof Truth have to help all, not only in launching upon the thrilling enterprise of attaining \nvictory over oneself, but also in every step which they take towards that attainment. There \nis no other way of sharing their burden. \nYe my devotees, I have full confidence that you will share this burden. Many of you have for \nyears together obeyed my orders and carried out my instructions through faith in me and \nlove for me. You have stuck to me and my spiritual cause through storm and stress and thick \nand thin. And now the time has come for you to offer all your services in my mission of \nhelping humanity to tread the spiritual path for realising God. \nThe eternal truth that God alone is real has to be clearly understood and unreservedly \naccepted, and it has to be unequivocally expressed through words and deeds. In the full \nrealisation of the Truth, man shall attain spiritual freedom. \nNo sacrifice is too big for setting man free from spiritual bondage, and in helping him to \ninherit the Truth, which alone shall bring abiding peace to all, and which alone will \nunfailingly sustain an unassailable sense of universal fellowhood, cemented by the \nungrudging love of all for all as expressions of the same reality. \nIn this God-willed, divinely planned and predestined task of bringing spiritual freedom to \nhumanity, you my devotees have to help me, even at the cost of life. In your duty of helping \nothers to find God, you have to welcome every type of suffering and sacrifice. Those desiring \nspecific instructions in the line of work most suitable to their individual circumstances may \ncommunicate with me. \nDecember 1942 or January \nor February 1943, \nDi v5 p5, \nalso Me p53-54. \nAnother version: \nLM8 p2832-2835 \n... It is imperatively necessary to be discriminatively aware of the flow of time in creation. \nAnd it is particularly necessary to appreciate fully the supreme importance of the moment \nwhich is in the near future, and which shall witness the universal dispensation of the truth \nof spiritual wisdom. \nThe task for spiritual workers is to help me in this universal dispensation of the truth to \nsuffering humanity. You have not only to prepare humanity in receiving this truth, but also \nfor getting established in it. But it is extremely important to remember that you can help \nothers to gain spiritual freedom and to come out of the illusion of duality, only if you \nyourself do not miss this idea of unity while working for others, who are inclined to create \ndivisions where they do not exist, and who allow no respite to spiritual workers. The minds \nof the people have to be completely purged of all forms of selfishness and narrowness if \nthey are to inherit the life in eternity which I bring... \nI am fully confident that you will lend yourselves ungrudgingly for this work. And you will \nhelp it if you unreservedly follow the spiritual instructions which shall be given to you \nseparately. You have to do your work without worrying about consequences, irrespective of \nsuccess or failure. But you may be sure that the result of work which is done in this spirit \nand with this understanding is forgone. \nThrough the untiring activities of spiritual workers, humanity shall be initiated into the new \nlife of abiding peace and dynamic harmony, unconquerable faith and unfading bliss, \nimmortal sweetness and incorruptible purity, creative love and infinite understanding. \n14 February 1943, \nMe p55-62, \nalso Di v5 p8, 12 \nAnother version: \nLM8 p2848-2849 \nComing Attractions Part 2 \nComing Attractions Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

It initiates a new way of thinking in terms of an \nindivisible totality. And it discards all the relative values of comparison in favor of the \nrecognition of the intrinsic worth of everything. \nIn the civilisation which is based upon a true idea of the spiritual infinity of the Truth, there \nwill therefore be no problems of majority and minority, of rivalry and competition, and of \nthose comparisons and laborious assessments which so often become a shelter of pride and \nseparative ego. Life then will be infinitely simple and integral, because the illusions which \ncreate rifts and complexities will all have disappeared. \n1943? Di v5 p19 \nUnaware as you are of my reasons and purposes for the ever-repeated postponements in \nthe breaking of my silence, and for my apparently giving vague promises - which are likely \nto create doubts in the weak ones, but add strength of test in the strong ones - you should be \naware of my methods of working. \nIt is that I always allow things to shape themselves out in the natural course, and I seldom \nput my mind into bringing about merely mundane results... \nI therefore emphasise, and repeat once again, for you to have full faith in the \naccomplishment of what I have stated, and to remain brave in heart, even if God's ways, for \nthe time being, seem inscrutable. \n5 August 1943, \nLahore, India, \nLM8 p2911 \nOut of the agonising travail and suffering of the present times, the new enlightened \nhumanity has to be born. Man shall be weaned away from the allurements of the ego-life. He \nshall come into full inheritance of his own divinity, and know himself to be none other than \nthe supreme God himself. And his heart shall be unlocked so as to release the dynamic love \ndivine. \nDivine love knows no decay, fear or corruption, because it is illumined by the understanding \nthat all life is one. \nLet those who are alive to the real values hearken to this call of mine. They will have an \nample share in bringing into existence the new era of truth and love. \nI give my blessings to all. \n11 November 1944, \nNagpur, Me p66 \nI give my blessings to all who are thirsting for the full realisation of divinity, for they shall be \nthe pillars of the coming era of truth and love. \n12 November 1944, \nNagpur, Me p70 \nIn the war-crazy world around you today, what do you see with regard to the quality and \nquantity of suffering and pain that has afflicted humanity in general? \nIt is patent to all that not only those who have taken up arms and are actually engaged in \nfighting have suffered intense loss and pain, but even the innocent and the peace-loving \nsection of humanity - men, women and children - have experienced and are experiencing \ncrucial agonies and tortures, both physical and mental. \nWhatever may be the political and economic explanation of the worldly wise in this respect, \nthis sanguine phenomena, from the spiritual point of view, is a cyclic divine visitation over \nwhich no earthly power has any control. The whole situation is simply and purely the \nresultant of the divine law of cause and effect, which is the same as conveyed by the Persian \nadage meaning \n'It is only from us whatever be upon us (good or bad).' \nHowever dark the clouds, and whatever may be the poignancy of pain and despair, one \nspiritual fact embodying cheer and hope to suffering humanity must not be lost sight of, \nwhich I am going to convey to you here today: \nThere are always two aspects of divinity, perpetually and eternally active in the affairs of \nthe world. The destructive aspect of divinity, as expressed in Persian, means 'self-\nglorification,' and the constructive aspect of divinity is called in Persian 'self-beautitude.' \nThe aspect of self-glorification by God, when it gets palpably active, entails suffering and \ndestruction on a colossal scale, as we see it today. The aspect of divine self-beautitude, when \nit asserts itself, brings in its wake peace and plenty. \nIn the aspect of self-glorification, divinity repels itself through its own creation. And in the \naspect of self-beautitude, divinity attracts or loves itself through its own creation. The \nformer is a negative method, and the latter is a positive method, and both these methods \nultimately are instruments of divine wisdom to rouse humanity to their divine heritage, \nwhich is self-realisation. \nFurther, both the aspects of God referred to just now not only affect humanity individually \nand collectively, but their intensity and force is directly in proportion to each other, and \nthey assert themselves in cyclic waves. \nNow that the destructive phase is about to weaken, the aspect of divine beautitude is nearly \ndue to come to the fore. And to invite humanity to avail themselves of this blessedness to \ncome is my divine mission in life. \nJust as in the present world catastrophe, even the guilty and the not-guilty, the combatants \nand non-combatants, have suffered intensely physically and mentally -- similarly, in the self-\nbeautitude aspect of God that is to be manifest in the near future, not only the deserving, but \nthe non-deserving as well, have as good a chance of being the recipients of divine grace -- \nprovided they are wide awake to the situation, which will be a cyclic dispensation rare and \nunique. \nMy blessings to all -- those who have heard my message, and those who have not. \n13 November 1944, \nNagpur, Me p 71-72 \nThe world storm, which has been gathering momentum, is now having its greatest outburst; \nand in reaching its climax, it will work universal disaster. In the struggle for material well-\nbeing, all grievances have assumed fantastic proportions. And the diverse differences of \nhuman interest have been so accentuated that they have precipitated distinctive conflict. \nHumanity has failed to solve its individual and social problems, and the evidence for this \nfailure is but too plain. The incapacity of men to deal with their problems constructively and \ncreatively reveals tragic deficiency in the right understanding of the basic nature of man and \nthe true purpose of life. \nThe world is witnessing an acute conflict between the forces of light and the forces of \ndarkness. On the one hand there are selfish persons who seek their happiness blindly \nthrough lust for power, unbridled greed and unrelieved hatred. Ignorant of the real purpose \nof life, they have sunk down to the lowest level of culture. And they bury their higher selves \nin the wreckage of crumbling forms which linger on from the dead past. Bound by material \ninterests and limited conceptions, they are forgetful of their divine destiny. They have lost \ntheir way, and their hearts are torn by the ravages of hate and rancour. \nOn the other hand there are persons who unveil their inherent higher self through the \nendurance of pain and deprivation, and through the noble acts of bravery and self-sacrifice. \nThe present war is teaching man to be brave, to be able to suffer, to understand and to \nsacrifice. \nThe disease of selfishness in mankind will need a cure, which is not only universal in its \napplication, but is drastic in its nature. It is so deep-rooted that that it can be uprooted only \nif it is knocked from all sides. Real peace and happiness will dawn spontaneously when \nthere is the purging of selfishness. The peace and happiness which come from self-giving \nlove are permanent. Even the worst sinners can become great saints if they have the \ncourage and sincerity to invite a drastic and complete change of heart. \nThe present chaos and destruction will engulf the whole world. But this will be followed by \na very long period in which there shall be no war. The passing sufferings and miseries of our \ntimes would be worth enduring for the sake of the long period of happiness which is to \nfollow. \nWhat will the present chaos lead to? How will it all end? It can only end in one way. \nMankind will be sick of it all. Men will be sick of wanting and sick of fighting out of hatred. \nGreed and hatred will reach such intensity that everyone will become weary of them. They \nway out of the deadlock will be found through selflessness. The only alternative which will \nbring solution will be to stop hating and to love, to stop wanting and to give, to stop \ndomination and to serve. \nGreat suffering shall awaken great understanding. Supreme suffering fulfills its purpose and \nyields its true significance when it awakens exhausted humanity, and stirs within it a \ngenuine longing for real understanding. Unprecedented suffering leads to unprecedented \nspiritual outcome. It contributes to the construction of life on the unshakeable foundation of \nthe Truth. \nIt is now high time that universal suffering should hasten humanity to the turning point in \nits spiritual history. It is now high time that the very agonies of our times should become a \nmedium for the bringing of a real understanding of human relationship. It is now high time \nfor humanity to face squarely the true causes of the catastrophe which has overtaken it. It is \nnow high time to seek a new experience of reality. To know that life is real and eternal is to \ninherit unfading bliss. It is time that men had this realisation by being unified with their \nown selves. \nThrough unification with the higher self, man perceives the infinite self in all selves; and he \nbecomes free by outgrowing and discarding the limitations of the ego-life. The individual \nsoul has to realise its identity with the supreme universal soul with full  consciousness. Men \nshall have reorientation of life in the light of this ancient truth, and they will readjust their \nattitude towards their neighbors in everyday life. To perceive the spiritual value of oneness \nis to promote real unity and cooperation. Brotherhood then becomes a spontaneous \noutcome of true perception. \nThe new life which is based upon spiritual understanding is an affirmation of the Truth. It is \nnot something which belongs to utopia, but is completely practical. Now that humanity is \nthrown into the fire of bloody conflicts, it is, through immense anguish, experiencing the \nutter instability and futility of the life which is based upon purely material conceptions. The \nhour is near when men, in their eager longing for real happiness, will seek the true source of \nhappiness. \nThe time is also ripe when men will ardently seek to contact the embodiment of the Truth in \nthe form of a God-man, through whom they can be inspired and lifted into spiritual \nunderstanding. They will accept the guidance which comes from divine authority. Only the \noutpouring of divine love can bring about spiritual awakening. \nIn this critical time of universal suffering, men are becoming ready to turn towards their \nhigher self, and to fulfill the will of God. Divine love will perform the supreme miracle of \nbringing God into the hearts of men, and of getting them established in lasting and sure \nhappiness. It will satisfy the greatest need and longing of mankind. Divine love will make \nmen selfless and helpful in their mutual relations, and it will bring about the final solution of \nall problems. The new brotherhood on earth shall be a fulfilled fact, and nations will be \nunited in the fraternity of love and truth. \nMy existence is for this love and this truth; and to suffering humanity I say: \nHave hope. I have come to help you in surrendering yourselves to the cause of God, and in \naccepting his grace of love and truth. I have come to help you in winning the one victory of \nall victories - to win yourself. \nNovember? 1944, Me p22-25 \nA gigantic disaster will overwhelm the world which will wipe out three-fourths of mankind. \n8 November 1945, \nAngiras Rishi Hill, \nTapovan to Adi K. Irani, \nLM9 p3081 \nThere will be revolution all over  India, including Ahmednagar. The face of the country will \nchange as the time of my manifestation is nearing. \n7 December 1946, \nMeherabad, \nLM9 p3141 \nThe world is now drawing very close to the great upheaval which will precede the breaking \nof my silence. This upheaval will entail great suffering to humanity, but this very suffering \nwill work a profound change of heart, and will sweep the world clean for the new and vital \nphase that must follow. \nMarch 1947, \nMahabaleshwar, \nAw 6:2 p12 \nAnother version: \nGG1 p199 \nDon't expect anything to be easy. Life will be full of problems, and the world even more so. \nIn fact, in years to come the world will reach a zenith of anti-God thinking, immorality, lust \nand greed, because the ending of a vast cycle of cycles is taking place. But after the climax, a \nnew era of brotherly love will be ushered in by God, who knows all that is going on. \nJanuary 1948, \nMeherazad \nto Ivy Duce, \nunpublished \nWhat do you think constitutes 100% proof of my manifestation as the Avatar? You men say \nthat at the time of my Avataric manifestation, mankind will receive a shock like an \nearthquake, and I will appear at different places in my physical form. But such ideas do not \nprove the Avatar's manifestation 100%. \nIn the Avatar is contained the whole creation. All the lives contained in the world are like his \nlimbs. If a scorpion stings a man on one part of his body, the brain immediately knows it and \npain is felt throughout the body. Similarly, when the Avatar will sting (manifest), every life \nsustained in creation will feel it. Thus the Avatar's presence on this (Gross) plane and the \nscorpion's sting (manifestation) will be experienced by all. \nIf the sun were to shine twenty-four hours a day, and there was no darkness, the presence \nof the sun would not be recognised unless there was complete darkness once. The rising of \nthe sun consequent to darkness would make humanity appreciate the presence of the sun. \nThe dark night is signified by the scorpion's sting. \nGhani: Darkness may also mean mass annihilation and dissolution of the world. \nBaba: After the Avatar's manifestation, humanity will receive the light in different degrees \nproportionate to each one's receptivity. Those out in the open will experience the full light \nof the sun. Those holding umbrellas over their heads will receive less, and those who \nremain closeted in their houses will get even less. This means that those who keep \nthemselves shut up in the houses of their desires will receive the least light. Those who, \nthough out in the open, hold an umbrella over their head - refuse to open their heart to God \n- will receive less. And those of pure desires and an open heart wil experience the full \nbrilliance of the Avatar's coming. \nGhani: Will we experience the light or not? \nBaba: Look at the ways of your Avatar. Although I stay in Ahmednagar during the day, I go \nall the way back to Pimpalgaon for the night. If you can grasp this, you will get the light. \n24 February 1948, \nPimpalgaon, \nLM7-8 preface \nAlthough physically Baba will depart soon, yet Baba is eternally everywhere. So stay where \nyou are and love me. And wherever you are, I will be with you. \n29 September 1954, \nMeherabad, \nGG6 p160 \nThe Mandali have asked me today to say in a few words exactly and precisely what will \nhappen to me. So I tell you - note it down. \nIn October at Satara, I shall be appearing to lead a retired, normal life, eating, taking walks, \nand so on. But there will be no use of the board and other things from 7 October, as I have \ntold you. By the end of April, 1955, I shall drop this body. During the six months, from \nNovember to April, three phases of the Avatar-life will manifest themselves. \nFirst, a very strange and serious disease will attack this body, which will be the cause of my \nhumiliation that I have been speaking about. Secondly, the humiliation will end in the \nsudden breaking of my silence, and my uttering of that word that only God can utter. \nThirdly, glorification will replace humiliation. All the pent-up infinity in me will splash and \nspread all over the universe... \n(Baba asked Dr. Donkin to read out something he had dictated, and said that it was \nimportant) \nDonkin: Baba wants to use a simile about the atom bomb. Just as an atom bomb, which in \nitself is so small, when exploded causes tremendous havoc, so, when he breaks his silence, \nthe universal spiritual upheaval that will take place will be something that no one can \ndescribe. It will happen in a second, at a time when nobody expects it. Just as when an \nearthquake takes place suddenly when no one is ready, and no one can do anything, but \neveryone in the affected area feels it, so the breaking of his silence will create a spiritual \nupheaval, and everyone will feel it in his heart. \nAnd, unbelievable as it may seem, my universal glorification, he says, will not be manifested \nvery near my physical presence, wherever I may be then. At the time of my glorification, all \nwill feel it throughout the world, but those who are around me will not be affected. They \nwho will be there will not be merely disinterested in Baba, they will actually be hostile. \nFor example, I may be then in Poona, with no one from the Mandali near me, but thirty or \nforty of the hostile group may be there, and they will not feel the glorification and upheaval. \nAll the rest of the world will feel it. No one of my Mandali or lovers will be near me when I \nam beaten and finally stabbed. \nYet I never die. I am always the Ancient one. You should all remember that God alone is real, \nall else is illusion. \nYour attending this meeting and hearing in precise and definite terms about these \nhappenings will be worth it if all of you, or if some of you, or at least a few of you spread the \nmessage of my love to others. \n30 September 1954, \nMeherabad, \nDV 6:12 p14-15 \n... The time is fast approaching when all that I have repeatedly stressed from time to time \nwill definitely come to pass. Most of you will witness those events, and will recall very \nvividly all that transpires during these two days of your stay at Meherabad. \nI have come not to establish anything new - I have come to put life into the old. I have not \ncome to establish retreats or ashrams. I create them for the purpose of my universal work, \nonly to repeatedly dissolve them once that purpose has been served. The universe is my \nashram, and every heart is my house. But I manifest only in those hearts in which all other \nthan me ceases to live. When my universal religion of love is on the verge of fading into \ninsignificance, I come to breathe life into it, and to do away with the farce of dogmas that \ndefile it in the name of religions and stifle it with ceremonies and rituals. \nThe present universal confusion and unrest has filled the heart of man with greater lust for \npower and a greed for wealth and fame, bringing in its wake untold misery, hatred, jealousy, \nfrustration and fear. Suffering in the world is at its height in spite of all the striving to \nspread peace and prosperity to bring about lasting happiness. \nFor man to have a glimpse of lasting happiness, he has first to realise that God, being in all, \nknows all; that God alone acts and reacts through all; that God, in the guise of countless \nanimate and inanimate entities, experiences the innumerably varied phenomena of \nsuffering and happiness, and that God himself undergoes all these illusory happenings. Thus \nit is God who has brought suffering in human experience to its height, and God alone who \nwill efface this illusory suffering and bring the illusory happiness to its height. \nWhether it manifests as creation or disappears into the oneness of reality, whether it is \nexperienced as existing and real, or is perceived to be false and nonexistent, illusion \nthroughout is illusion. There is no end to it, just as there is no end to imagination. \nThere are two aspects experienced in illusion - manyness and oneness. While manyness \nmultiplies manyness, oneness goes on magnifying itself. Manyness is the religion of illusion \non which illusion thrives. \nIn the illusory beginning of time, there was no such state of mess in illusion as there is \ntoday. When the evolution of consciousness began, there was oneness in spite of the \ndiversity in illusion. With the growth of consciousness, manyness also went on increasing, \nuntil now it is about to overlap the limit. Like the wave that reaches its crest, this height of \nmanyness will dissolve itself and bring about the beginning of oneness in illusion. Suffering \nat its height will cause the destruction of the climax of manyness in illusion. \nThe time has come for the pre-ordained destruction of multiple separateness, which keeps \nman from experiencing the feeling of unity and brotherhood. This destruction, which will \ntake place very soon, will cause three-fourths of the world to be destroyed.* The remaining \none-fourth will be brought together to live a life of concord and mutual understanding, thus \nestablishing a feeling of oneness in all fellow beings, leading them towards lasting \nhappiness. Before I break my silence or immediately after it, three-fourths of the world will \nbe destroyed. I shall speak soon to fulfill all that is shortly to come to pass. \nTo affirm religious faiths, to establish societies, or to hold conferences will never bring \nabout the feeling of unity and oneness in the life of mankind, now completely absorbed in \nthe manyness of illusion. Unity in the midst of diversity can be made to be felt only by \ntouching the very core of the heart. That is the work for which I have come. I have come to \nsow the seed of love in your hearts, so that in spite of all superficial diversity which your life \nin illusion must experience and endure, the feeling of oneness through love is brought about \namongst all the nations, creeds, sects and castes of the world. \nIn order to bring this about, I am preparing to break my silence. When I break my silence, it \nwill not be to fill your ears with spiritual lectures. I shall speak only one word, and this word \nwill penetrate the hearts of all men, and make even the sinner feel that he is meant to be a \nsaint, while the saint will know that God is in the sinner as much as he is in himself. \nWhen I speak that word, I shall lay the foundation for that which is to take place during the \nnext 700 years. When I come again after 700 years, the evolution of consciousness will have \nreached such an apex that materialistic tendencies will be automatically transmuted into \nspiritual longing, and the feeling of equality in universal brotherhood will prevail. This \nmeans that opulence and poverty, literacy and illiteracy, jealousy and hatred, which are in \nevidence today in their full measure, will then be dissolved through the feeling of the \noneness of all men. Prosperity and happiness will then be at its zenith. \nThis does not mean that oneness in illusion shall remain so eternally. That is because all this \nthat is, is illusion, and the consciousness of oneness as well as of manyness in illusion is part \nof the process of evolution. The time is bound to recur when there will be again the same \nbeginning, growth and culmination of the heights of manyness and oneness in illusion. \nMy next advent after I drop this body will be after 700 years, and that will mark the end and \nthe beginning of a Cycle of cycles. All cycles of time in illusion end and begin after 700 to \n1400 years, and there have been and will be millions and billions of such cycles in a Cycle of \ncycles; thus there is no end to illusion, which always remains illusion. \n*Baba later explained that this destruction was 'in my own language alone' - see the next \nquote. \nAge after age I come amidst mankind to maintain my own creation of illusion, thereby also \nawakening humanity to become aware of it. The framework of illusion is always one and the \nsame, but the designs in illusion are innumerable and ever-changing. My advent is not to \ndestroy illusion, because illusion, as it is, is absolutely nothing. I come to make you become \naware of the nothingness of illusion. Through you I automatically maintain illusion, which is \nnothing but the shadow of my infinite self, and through me, you automatically discard \nillusion when you are made aware of its falseness. \nMy manifestation as the Avatar of the time will be of short duration. This short period will, \nin quick succession, cover my humiliation, the breaking of my silence, my glorification, and \nmy violent physical end. Everlastingly, with all the divine bliss within me, I eternally suffer \nfor one and all - thus I am crucified eternally and continually for all. \nDuring this short period, my word of words will touch the hearts of all mankind, and \nspontaneously this divine touch will instill in man the feeling of the oneness of all fellow-\nbeings. Gradually, in the course of the next 700 years, this feeling will supersede the \ntendency of separateness, and rule over the hearts of all, driving away hatred, jealousy and \ngreed that breed suffering, and happiness will reign. \npart of the 'Final Declaration' \n30 September 1954, Meherabad \nAM p3-6, also LA p700-701, \nand GG6 p166-169 \nIt is really very difficult for anyone to believe and understand what I say, because none can \ngrasp the meaning underlying my words... \nEveryone is free to interpret my words in any way he thinks and feels. But one thing I tell \nyou, that whenever I say a thing, I naturally use my own language, and whatever is said by \nme is truth. But my language is such that none can understand or grasp the underlying \nmeaning of what I say. Therefore, when I want to say a thing, I have simultaneously to make \nuse of your language also, knowing well that you would understand nothing whatsoever if I \nwere to make use of my language alone. \nIn order to help you understand my Final Declaration, and to put an end to your confusion \nand worry, I want all of you to know that when you saw me dictate on my alphabet board \nduring the meetings at Meherabad, and heard about \n1. A strange disease attacking my body: it was said in your language. \n2. The humiliation that I will suffer: it was said in your language. \n3. The breaking of my silence and my uttering the one word of words: it was said in my own \nlanguage, and simultaneously in yours, because when I utter that word, it will be an audible \nword to you. \n4. My glorification: it was said simultaneously in my language and yours. \n5. The destruction of three-fourths of the world: it was said in my own language alone. \n6. The stab in the back: was said in my own language alone. \n7. The dropping of my body: it was said in my own language and simultaneously in yours. \nConsequently, whatever is said by me in your language, you are able to understand and \nknow what is said, but that which is said in my own language is impossible for you to \nunderstand, however much you all may try to interpret and grasp the underlying meaning \nbehind my words. Only the fulfillment of events can unfold to you, in due course, the \nmeaning of what is said in my own language. \n20 November 1954, \nAM p7-8 \nThere is not reason at all for any of you to worry. Baba was, Baba is, and Baba will also be \neternally existent. Severance of external relations does not mean the termination of internal \nconnection. The external contacts had been maintained till now. The time has now come for \nbeing bound in the chain of internal connections. Hence external contact is no longer \nnecessary. It is possible to establish the internal link by obeying Baba's orders. I give you all \nmy blessings for strengthening these internal links. \nI am always with you, and I am not away from you. I was, am, and will remain eternally with \nyou, and it is for promoting this realisation that I have severed external contact. This will \nenable all persons to realise Truth by being bound to each other with internal links. \nOh my lovers, I love you all. It is only because of my love for my creation that I have \ndescended on earth. Let not your hearts be torn asunder by my declarations concerning the \ndropping of my body. On the contrary, accept my divine will cheerfully. You can never \nescape from me. Even if you try to escape from me, it is not possible to get rid of me. \nTherefore have courage and be brave. \nIf you thus lose your hearts, how will it be possible for you to fulfill the great task that I have \nentrusted to you? Be brave and spead my message of love far and wide to all quarters in \norder to fulfill my divine will. Let the words 'Baba, Baba' come forth from every nook and \ncorner of the world, and from the mouth of every child, and let their ignorance be reduced \nto ashes by the burning flame of my love. \nCome together in order to fulfill my will by taking your stand on truth, love and honesty, \nand be worthy of participating in my task. I give you all my blessings for spreading my \nmessage of love. \n7 October 1954, \nSatara, \ntranslated from Hindi \nby C.D. Deshmukh, \nLF p139-140 \nPeople generally remain indifferent when I am present among them. They understand and \nappreciate me more after I drop my body. That is the way whenever I come. \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p14 \nIt is a fact that I have come amongst you. One of these days the whole world will come to \nrealise how I have come, where I have come from, and the purpose of my coming. \nI repeat once again that I have come neither to establish panths and jaats (groups and \nclasses), nor to establish mandirs, masjids, churches and ashrams in the world. \nI have come to receive the beauty and give the blessings of love. All else but God -- whether \nrites, rituals or ceremonies in the name of religion, worldly possessions, family, money, or \none's own physical body -- all else but God is illusion. \n1955, \nIndia, \nLH p240 \nThe infinite bliss of my Self-realisation was, is and will remain continuous. At the moment, I \nexperience both infinite bliss as well as infinite suffering. Once I drop the body, only bliss \nwill remain. \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p246 \nIt seems to all that I give promises, and break all of them. But I fulfill all of them... \nI am master of the art of telling lies, of giving promises and not fulfilling them. But \nremember, I am beyond all that too, and therefore I fulfill every promise given. \n26 January 1956, \nSakori, \nGl Aug 1993 p9 \nI have been made to take this human form by the five Perfect Masters of this age to bear the \ncross and to undergo humiliation. \nYou have read in the Gospels wherein Christ had  said to his apostles, \"You will deny me.\" \nThis did happen when Peter, the chief apostle, denied Jesus. \nThe thing is that during the phase of humilation, the circumstances will so array themselves \nthat you won't be aware when my daaman has slipped off your hands. At that time, you may \neven feel justified in leaving me. \nBut if you feel that this should not happen, there is one remedy. You should grasp well all \nthat I say, and understandingly act up to it. You should also tell all of what you hear today to \nthose who are not present. \nIn short, I clearly see the dark cloud. I do not wish to make a mere mention of the dark cloud \nwithout any reason, but this is my loving warning to you so that my daaman may not slip off \nyour hands. \n19 May or 2 June 1957, \nPoona, \nBG p16. \nAlso, Gl May 1980 \nBeing the Avatar, I have come to awaken mankind, and would like the entire world to come \nto me. \nReal saints are dearest and nearest to my heart. \nPerfect Ones and lovers of God adorn the world, and will ever do so. \nThe physical presence of the Perfect Masters throughout eternity is not necessarily confined \nto any particular or special part of the globe. \nMy salutations to all - the past, present and future Perfect Masters, real saints - known and \nunknown - lovers of God, and to all other beings, in all of whom I reside, whether \nconsciously felt by them or not. \n20 July 1957, LC p77 \nNot a single thing that I have said is untrue. Not one thing that I have stated will fail to occur. \nIt is only that you cannot and do not understand the language I use. And if I do not use the \nlanguage to suit your understanding, it is from my true compassion and mercy. \nbefore 19 August 1957, \nHM p301 \nThe world, once it knows who I am, will understand then what I want you to understand \nnow - that from the beginningless beginning, I am the Ancient one, immutable and eternal... \nI have already warned you of the dark cloud which I clearly see hovering over me. I have \nbeen referring to it in one way or another for many years. \nIn fact, only the shape of things changes every time I come, and that is why I say the same \nthings again and again in different ways. At the time of Jesus, I uttered many warnings, yet \nnone could grasp in advance about my crucifixion. \nThe dark cloud is very, very near to bursting, and I have to take the whole force of it upon \nmyself. You can have no idea what that will mean for me. It will be like hell itself bursting \nupon me on earth. Be resolved to hold fast to my daaman even when this cloud bursts. You \nwill thereby share in my work... \nLook at the weapons of destruction science has evolved. Nation accuses nation of \npreparations for war, and world catastrophe might come without warning at any moment. \nWorld events reflect the results of my inner working. \nAt the time of the Flood, hell was let loose in the world. Scientists and statesmen now \nsolemnly declare that if total war comes, the whole world may perish. They are just echoing \nme. But the whole world cannot perish because I have to come down again after 700 years... \nJust as I am now quite unable to do so many physical things unaided, in spite of an \notherwise healthy body, I may, at the time of the impending crisis, become even mentally \nhelpless, without being mentally deranged in the least. You may then not be able to continue \nto hold on to my daaman because circumstances will seemingly justify your letting it go. \nI am infinitely merciful, and so repeat the same theme again and again, so that you may \nremember my words and try your best to cling to me. \nFor example, in a sudden and terrifying earthquake, any man, in the blind hope of saving his \nlife, is likely to run, forgetting in an instant his family and all his possessions, and thus \nforsake them before he realises what he has done. \nWhatever is to happen will happen. This is the principle, or as I call it, the Law of Must, the \nlaw on which universal illusion thrives. It is as if the ready and complete film of illusion, \nfrom the beginningless beginning to the endless end, is being projected continually. \nIf it is destined that my daaman should slip from your hands, it will. But it is for me to warn, \nand for you to remain alert. \n8 September 1957, \nMeherabad, \nLC p79-82 \nAge after age, when the Avatar comes, he has only a small group of followers. In this cycle, it \nis different, this cycle is something special. Now thousands in the south of  India follow me. \nRecently the government approved a textbook of my life for use in the schools. The \nZoroastrians were once opposed to me, but now they come and love me... \nOnly a few will hold on to me... those who are near to me, not in space, but in love. The rest \nwill leave me. The age-old experience will be repeated. In this incarnation I have a large \nfollowing, but again I shall be left with a few. It is as if around me there are many beautiful \nbuildings. It took years to build them. But when an earthquake comes, they are destroyed in \na few seconds. Only a few survive. \n... You will see me only in memory. When I drop my body, I will remain in all who love me. I \ncan never die. Love me, obey me, and you will find me. \n20 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina, \nAw 5:3 p7 \nAnother version: \nEvery time I come, it happens. I have a small crowd of followers, and at a critical time, they \ndeny me. \nThis time Baba has a large following, and yet, at the nick of time, they also will deny me. \nAround me there are beautiful buildings, homes that took years to build. It took years to \nbuild structures like these, but it does not take five seconds to demolish these structures. \nAt this particular time, it is only those who love and obey Baba 100% who will be able to \nhold onto him in the nick of time. \n20 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, \nHM p307 \n(Ivy Duce wrote about the analogy of the buildings, \"Baba gave an example... comparing us \nto castles.\") \nIf six cobras came into this room suddenly from out there, would you just sit still here with \nme? \nNo, you would be flying out the doors and windows as fast as you could, in sheer panic. You \nwould forget all about Baba. \nPeter denied me when I was Jesus. \nThe dark cloud of which I have been talking is very, very near. It will happen suddenly, from \nan unexpected angle, just like I have mentioned the sudden onrush of the cobras. You will \nnot expect it from such an angle, and you will feel justified in leaving me. \nEach will be tried by his psychological weakness, but try to hang on. \n20 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, \nto the Sufi group, \nHM p308 \nWhen I leave this body, it will have its rest in the tomb on this hill. After 70 years, this hill \nwill turn into a place of world pilgrimage, where lovers of God, philosophers and celebrities \nwill come to pay homage to the tomb. \n1958, \nIndia, \nAw 5:3 p12 \nDo you realise what it means to follow me? It means to leave all and follow me. And do you \nknow what it is to leave all? It is to leave everything, even your self, behind you. \nThis means that, having left everything behind, you have to follow me, and not run ahead of \nme. And to do this is so very difficult because it is so very simple. \nIf you let your will guide you, so that you walk ahead of me, you become your own \nobstruction to my leading you. And since you are ignorant of the pitfalls on the way, I have \nto keep a constant watch lest you fall. What this amounts to is that, instead of you following \nme, I have to follow you. \nI am not limited by form. I am within everyone, and within you, as the real guide. So \nfollowing me does not mean that you have to leave everything and stay near me. It also does \nnot mean that you are to use me as a dumping board for your worries, nor that you are to \nexpect me to fulfill your wants. It means that you are to be completely resigned to my will, \nand abide in a spirit of total surrender. \nTo follow me is to obey me and to do as I want. When my will becomes your way, you are \ntruly following me, and then you are safe and you are saved. I know the way and its \nlabyrinths, for I am the way and I am the goal. \nJanuary 1959, \nPoona, \nto an individual, \nAO p167 \n... I lay down no precepts. When I release the tide of truth which I have come to give, men's \ndaily lives will be the living precept. The words I have not spoken will come to life in them. \nI veil myself from man by his own curtain of ignorance, and manifest my glory to a few. \nMy present Avataric form is the last incarnation of this cycle of time, hence my \nmanifestation will be the greatest. When I break my silence, the impact of my love will be \nuniversal, and all life in creation will know, feel and receive of it. It will help every individual \nto break himself free from his own bondage in his own way. I am the divine beloved who \nloves you more than you can ever love yourself. The breaking of my silence will help you to \nhelp yourself in knowing your real self. \nAll this world confusion and chaos was inevitable, and no one is to blame. What had to \nhappen has happened, and what has to happen will happen. There was and is no way out \nexcept through my coming in your midst. I had to come, and I have come. I am the Ancient \none. \nUniversal Message, \nc.1960? \nLA p711 \n... That which you as individuals know at this moment, I knew aeons ago. And what you as \nindividuals in ages to come will be knowing at a particular moment, I know now. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p58 \nBeing the highest and becoming the lowest, I manifest knowledge and assume ignorance at \nthe same time. Even though I know a certain thing will happen within a month, I may chalk \nout plans as if it was not to occur for years. Again, knowing that an event will not take place \nfor years, I appear to expect it to happen shortly. \nIn dnyan (knowledge) there is adnyan (non-knowledge or ignorance). But in adnyan there \ncannot be dnyan. Having all knowledge on the highest level, I can assume full ignorance on \nyour level. In fact, I am infinite knowledge, and as such, I know what is to happen even after \nhundreds of years. Yet I profess ignorance while I am on your level... \nI who am knowledge itself manifest ignorance of knowledge. Knowing all, I seem not to \nknow, at one and the same time. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p61 \nI am the Lord of the universe, and when I give up my body, the world will recognise me. \n1960, Poona, Aw 22:1 p40 \nI belong to no religion. My religion is love. Every heart is my temple. \nAlthough it is in love that you have built this house of stone, I am only in it when your heart \nbrings me here. \nAlways remember that ceremonies cover me, but pure worship reveals me. \nAll those who surrender themselves in love to me will see and adore and realise the reality \nbehind my form. \nbefore 26 November 1961, \nfor Meher Dham, \nNauranga, \nU.P., Mu p372, \nalso LC p110 \nYou people have been worrying about Berlin. It wasn't Berlin you should have worried \nabout, it was Cuba. That situation has given me a terrible time. It was touch and go for quite \na while. You have no idea how serious it was. \n(Ivy Duce wrote, \"He went on to say that the third world war has already started on the \nborder between Communist China and India\") \nI am the nut in the nutcracker. The Chinese are my children, and the Indians are my \nchildren. You might find the Chinese at our gate, so be careful. \nAfter 1962, everything will be upside down. World War III will not be fought where it has \nbeen fought before. It will be fought here, and will spread into the Near and Middle East. \nThe Chinese will retreat this winter, but they will return after the snows melt. But India will \nwin in the end. \nNovember 1962, \nPoona, \nHM p360-361 \nWhen I break my silence, my presence will flood the world, and even an inanimate thing like \na stone will feel my love. \nApril? 1963, \nIndia, \nLA p602 \nMy silence, and the breaking of my silence at the appointed time, will make silent those who \ntalk of everything but God. \nMay? 1963, \nIndia, \nLA p604 \nHear me while I am silent, for when I break my silence, there will be nothing left for you to \nhear. \n20 August 1964, \n60th Family Letter, p2 \nNo messages about love and truth can draw the seeker even nearer to the real experience of \nthem. But the breaking of my silence will shatter the seeker's hard crust of ignorance, and \nreveal to him their true meaning. \nJune? 1964, \nIndia, \nLA p616-617 \nBe composed in the reality of my love, for all confusion and despair is your shadow, which \nwill vanish when I speak the word. \nFebruary? 1966, \nIndia, \nLA p636 \nGod's first word was 'Who am I?' God's last word is 'I am God.' And the word that I, the God-\nman, will utter soon will be the sound of my infinite silence. \nJune? 1966, \nIndia, \nLA p640 \nMy abode is infinite. It is formless. But there are seven doors in my abode. Each door \nremains closed to all those bound in illusion. \nThe aim of involution is to open these seven doors to experience my infinity. The first door \nis extremely difficult to open. All the kingdoms of evolution stand at this door. Humanity has \nits back to this door. All faces are turned toward illusion. Humanity is the nearest kingdom \nto this door. \nI come to open these seven doors. I work to cut a hole in the first door. That door leads to \nthe first plane. This cutting is my work during my lifetime. \n1967, India, \nto Bhau Kalchuri, \nAw 21:2 p59, \nalso AA p189 \nI am both divine and human. Those who live with me feel more of my humanity than my \ndivinity. Those whom I permit to come and see me for awhile see more of my divinity than \nmy humanity. \nAll my intimate lovers, whether living with me or away from me, will in the end experience \nmy divinity. \nMay 1967, \nMeherazad, \nLA p650 \n... My mental and spiritual suffering will end only when I break my silence. \n1? June 1967, \nMeherazad, \nLA p650 \nDivine father, help your beloved son to carry out all your work this year, for July of this year \nwill mark the last year of his silence. \n17 January 1968, \nMeher Mouna \nVani 10, p19 \n(10 April 1969) \nNone can have the least idea of the immensity of the work that I am doing in this seclusion. \nThe only hint I can give is that, compared with the work I do in seclusion, all the important \nwork of the world put together is completely insignificant. Although for me the burden of \nmy work is crushing, the result of my work will be intensely felt by all the people of the \nworld... \n... I repeat, something great will happen that has never happened before. But now it will not \nbe until soon after the 21st of May 1968. \nI also repeat that the fate of the universe hangs on my seclusion, and the redemption of \nmankind depends upon my manifestation... \nFebruary 1968, \nIndia, \nLA p659 \nMy work is done. It is completed 100% to my satisfaction. The result of this work will also \nbe 100%, and will manifest from the end of September. \n30 July 1968, \nIndia, \nLA p666 \nThose who wait for me never wait in vain. \nSeptember 1968, \nLA p666 \nBaba had asked that his followers not write him at all because of his seclusion work. Bhau \nKalchuri, one of Baba's Mandali, felt deeply disturbed that Baba would not reply to letters \nfrom his followers. Baba told him, \n\"My lovers are great. They want nothing material or spiritual. I come down to worship \nthem... \n\"Why are you so disturbed? You have been with me for so many years, and still you do not \nunderstand what I am doing for them. If they come here, what will they see? Only this \nphysical body. \n\"This is the real thing I am giving them (Baba made the gesture for his seclusion work, \nwhich was a fist against his thigh). My work is the real thing which I am giving them, and \nyou will witness with your own eyes what will happen to those who have not met me \nphysically.\" \nOctober 1968, \nAA p195, \nalso Aw 21:2 p58 \nTo love me for what I may give you is not loving me at all. To sacrifice anything in my cause \nto gain something for yourself is like a blind man sacrificing his eyes for sight. \nI am the divine beloved, worthy of being loved because I am love. He who loves me because \nof this will be blessed with unlimited sight and will see me as I am. \nJanuary? 1969, \nMeherazad, \nHM p418, \nalso LA p686 \nAll this that I have been through all along has been a preparation for the word - for just the \none word. (Baba smiled.) Just imagine. \n30 January 1969, \nMeherazad \nMeher Mouna Vani 10, \np18 (10 April 1969) \nCOMING ATTRACTIONS \nBook Two \n\"One day in the early forties, Baba called all of us and asked us 'What will happen to this \nworld? I'll give you five minutes to narrate the worst scenario.' \n\"Each of us described the horror that the world would experience. After listening to all of us, \nhe said, \n\" 'This is not even one percent of what will happen. The entire world will cry out. Food will \nnot be available, and people will eat the cloth off their backs. \n\" 'I will give those who are mine a small amount to eat, but what will happen to the rest?' \n\"On another day, Baba told us, 'I will close all the doors very slowly. Only then will \nsuffocated humanity become conscious of fresh air.' \nMansari Desai, \nGl Feb. 1997 p9 \n\"It seems that every personal ego has to come up to the surface and function, before it can \nbe destroyed, so the national ego, the religious ego, etc., must undergo, in the same way, the \nsame process of destruction. Love can then flow in to replace them. After the war, Baba told \nus this cleansing had by no means been fully accomplished, and that there was a choice of \ntwo ways to accomplish the rest. \n\"One would be a third and devastating world war, and the other way would be through \nsmall wars, earthquakes, general physical upheaval, starvation for some groups, and \nreligious groups vying with each other, their adherents killing each other to prove that their \nway was the only way to God. \n\"Baba then looked around the group, and asked which we thought was the better way. For \nonce unanimous, we said, 'The second way.' He made no indication as to the direction in \nwhich humanity would be swept, but certainly most of the things that he mentioned as the \nsecond way have already happened and are still, in many parts of the world, continuing to \ncause a general upheaval.\" \nMargaret Craske, \nDL p153-154 \n(India, 1945?) \n\"On one of these latter days, Baba emerged after having sat for many hours in complete \nseclusion, his face more drawn and weary than Adi ever remembered having seen it, and \nsaid that a gigantic disaster would overwhelm the world, that would wipe out three-\nquarters of mankind. \n\"Adi was deeply stirred, not only by the anguish on Baba's face, but also because he \nspontaneously dictated these words immediately on emerging from his seclusion, as if the \nwork done during that seclusion had been specifically related to the world passion of which \nhe spoke.\" \nWilliam Donkin, Wa p81 \n(November 1945, Angiras Rishi Hill) \nJal Tapasvi was, according to Meher Baba, a very high type of yogi and an Adept Pilgrim (a \nsalik of the fifth or sixth plane). He was also known as Jal Samadhi Mahatma. He had a talk \nwith Eruch and Kaka, and met Baba, on August 12, 1946. \n\"Jal Tapasvi lived for several years under a rock facing the Ganges. Later he moved to the \nroof of a temple that stood in the river. He sat there for many years without shelter, eating \nonly whatever was given him, and one supposes that not many people would venture to his \nrather inaccessible perch in the river. \n\"One day the temple fell into the river, but Jal Tapasvi was neither injured nor deterred by \nthis, and he continued to sit in the water on the ruins of the temple that were submerged \njust below the surface. For many years he sat there, and thus earned his name of Jal Tapasvi, \ni.e., one who carried out a penance of sitting (tapas) in water (jal). \n'He is now an old man, perhaps seventy years of age, very thin, but still has black hair. He \nwears a green kafni. Baba contacted him in the house of the manager of the Uttar Kashi Poor \nHouse (langar khana), who was then staying at Rishikesh. Jal Tapasvi usually stays at Uttar \nKashi.\" \n\"... Eruch and Kaka introduced themselves to him as coming from Bombay, and Jal Tapasvi \nat once asked how things went there. They told him that there were constant riots and \ndisturbances, and he replied that this was quite natural, and indeed, inevitable, and was the \nresult of the work of the Avatar, who was now alive. \n\"He said that the great men of the world, although famous and often worshipped by \nmankind, were mere playthings in the hands of the Avatar; they were like kites on strings, \nthe ends of which were all in the grasp of the Avatar, who controlled them as he wished. He \nwent on to say that these wars and disturbances would continue, and that three-quarters of \nthe world population would be wiped out; for, he said, how could the people from hell mix \nwith those from heaven; the former must be obliterated. \n\"The Avatar, he said, would manifest in twenty-two years time (i.e. in 1968 if taken \nliterally), but that even then, like other Avatars, he would be ridiculed by the majority, and \nhis real fame would grow after his death.\" \nWilliam Donkin, \nWa p 343-344 \n\"... In fact, Baba has been heard to have remarked that... more than a lakh of souls will have \nIllumination at his hands before his mission comes to an end.\" \nAbdul Ghani, HM p719 \na lakh = 100,000 \nIllumination = the experience of the sixth plane \n\"I spoke to Baba about someone who, in order to protect his family and himself from \ndestruction foretold by Baba, wanted to establish a home way up in the mountains, and \nstock it with the necessary food. \n\"Baba interrupted me and said, 'No place will be safe, not even the top of the Himalayas. \nOnly by the grace of God can one be saved.' \n\"So I asked Baba if this destruction would be a man-made or a natural one. \n\"Then Baba answered, 'It will be both.' \nFred Winterfeldt, \n1950s, Aw 7:1 p40 \n\"Last evening when the pain was bad, Baba said, \n'The accident* has been a blessing for the universe, and a curse for Baba.' \n... He said to the effect that all suffering borne by Baba is out of his compassion and love for \nhumanity. The suffering yet to come for the world will be so great that it could not sustain it, \nand so Baba takes one end of the yoke on his shoulder.\" \n15 December 1956? \nMani Irani, HM p294 \n*A car accident in which Baba was very badly hurt \n\"Even if the sky and earth should come together, do not let go my daaman.\" \nMeher Baba, \n1960, Poona, \nto Hoshang Bharucha, \nAw 22:1 p38 \n\"Once I spoke a word, and the creation came into being.

When \nI break my silence and speak, I will utter this word of words through my human mouth... \nAnd because all forms and words are from this primal sound or original word, and are \ncontinuously connected with it and have their life from it, when it is uttered by me it will \nreverberate in all people and creatures, and all will know that I have broken my silence and \nhave uttered that sound or word. \nAw 11:3 p2 \nThe world is approaching a glorious dawn once again in its inevitable course of ups and \ndowns. \nAw 17:1 p36 \n(Probably 1950s) \nWhen I break my silence, the world will come to know who I am. \nAs a rule, in the past, it has been the lot of posterity to know who the Avatar was. But in this \nunique Avataric advent, the world will know who the Avatar is while Baba is yet on earth. \nST (inside front cover) \nAgain and again, God takes human form to suffer for his creation. I am that one. Like you, I \nalso have a body and a mind and so on. I feel hunger, thirst, etc. But I also have the Universal \nbody and the Universal mind, and therefore your individual suffering is nothing compared \nto my eternal universal suffering. \nI have infinite knowledge. I do not have to use my mind in order to know - I just know. I use \nmy infinite knowledge. But although I have infinite bliss and power, I do not make use of \nthem. If I were to make use of the bliss that is at my beck and call, how could my suffering be \nsuffering? And of what benefit would it be to mankind? \nI also do not use my infinite power. If I were to use it, how would I remain helpless? I \nremain infinitely helpless because while having infinite power at my command, I do not use \nit. I shall use it only when I break my silence to give a universal spiritual awakening. And \nwhen I drop this body, I shall use my bliss for 700 years till my next advent. \nMu p574-575 \nI am not limited by this form. I use it like a garment to make myself visible to you, and I \ncommunicate with you through words best fitted to your understanding. If I used the \nlanguage of my own consciousness, you would not know what I was talking about. \nDon't try to understand me. My depth is unfathomable. Just love me. I eternally enjoy the \nChrist state of consciousness, and when I speak I shall manifest my true self. Besides giving \na general spiritual push to the whole world, I shall lead all those who come to me towards \nlight and truth. \nMu p596 \nI am so infinite that I myself cannot fathom my own infinity. My shadow, the creation, is also \nso infinite that once I tried to see with my Gross eyes all that had come out of me, but I \nfailed. \nScientists will soon discover a little of what I say. There are 18,000 worlds that are \ninhabited by human beings. In some the people are extremely intelligent, in others less, and \nin still others still less. None of them who live in these worlds have any experience of the \nSubtle world. People from those worlds must be born on this earth to experience the Subtle \nand Mental worlds. \nThis is an Avataric age, and a special Avataric age, as I am observing silence. Science and \nanti-God elements will reach their zenith... before I break my silence. So my manifestation \nwill also be the greatest. Breaking my silence will be as forceful as hundreds of thousands of \natom bombs exploding. \nScience is practically heading to its zenith today because of the very intelligent souls of the \nother worlds coming down here (to this our earth). Our population is increasing by leaps \nand bounds for the same reason, that souls are migrating from other worlds as they want a \nhuman body on this earth in this Avataric age. Remember one thing: all is illusion. Only God \nis real, and I am God in human form. \nMu p575 \nWhen I break my silence, the hearts of all those who have come in contact with me will be \nignited with love. \nMu p596 \nComing Attractions Part 1 \nComing Attractions Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "CREATION \nMeher Baba \nThis whole universe, with all its vastness, grandeur and beauty, is nothing but sheer \nimagination. \nOctober 1922, Bombay, LM2 p431 \nRamjoo Abdulla: What are the stars? \nBaba: Stars, like planets, are spheres. But many of the planets are inhabited by human \nbeings. They resemble the Earth in culture, science, and in every way materially... But from \nthe spiritual point of view, our Earth is the most advanced, for the Perfect Masters are born \non this planet. \nThese other planets seem far off from one another, but in reality they are close. After \nRealisation, a man finds them issuing from himself in the millions, like tiny bubbles. He finds \nhimself to be the source of everything, the maker of all. \nAlthough the Gross spheres of the universes are different, the spiritual planes from \nbeginning to end are one. \n23 April 1924, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p619 \nDue to worry, this universe came into being. And now man is unable to realise his own real \nself due to engaging his mind in worry. \n5 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nto Ramchandra Gadekar, \nLM3 p808 \nPeople say that God created maya, but it is not so. For example, take the hair on the head. \nThe hair is maya, and the head is God the creator. Although the hair grows on the head, the \nhead does not know how, why and where it comes from. Then how can it be said that the \nhead created hair, or God created maya? But in a way, the very creation of maya itself is \ndependent on God. Maya is sheer illusion, the force of imagination. \n30 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p820 \nQ. Why did God create all this? \nBaba: He did not create it. It started automatically. First there was God and nothing else. In \nGod was everything: experience, knowledge, power and existence. But he had no \nconsciousness that he was God. All this bother and headache you see around you is to gain \nthat consciousness. \n7 October 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p855 \nThere are countless universes. Every star, though appearing to be a mere sparkling dot, is \nnot a single world, but a mighty sun with a solar system of evolving planets like our own. \n17 May 1927, \nRahuri, \nLM3 p937 \nThe Sadguru can interfere in the Creator's working, but he rarely does so. For the most part \nhe leaves the Creator and the creation to manage their own affairs. \nJuly? 1927, \nMeherabad, \nSW p401 \nHow was the universe created? It was automatic. There are innumerable universes, which \nare interlaced with one another. One universe creates another in a chain reaction. These \nuniverses are so numerous that even Sadgurus cannot count them. I once tried to count \nthem while at Sakori with Upasani Maharaj. \nIt is astonishing that, though the chains of these universes come out of the Sadguru and then \nmerge back into him, they are still uncountable through his physical eyes. One night in \nSakori, Upasani Maharaj and I were sitting in his hut, when the topic of counting the \nuniverses arose. First Maharaj tried to count them. In order to count the universes, he first \nhad to stop the continuous flow of chains that are emerging, so he could count as many \nuniverses as possible. In order to do this, both his mind and the whole force of creation had \nto be concentrated on stopping the universes. This is extremely difficult and dangerous. \nFrom the oneness, duality is born, and this duality may prove fatal at times. The tension \ncreated by such concentration could cause one to drop the body. So when I tried, Maharaj \nprevented me from stopping the chain-flow, because it actually threatened my life, and I \ncould have died. \nMaharaj told me, 'No Sadguru was ever successful in this counting, since the flow of direct \nknowledge is from the Sadguru himself. If this flow is stopped to count the universes, \nduality is affected. The Sadguru's life is put in danger by duality's reaction.' \nThese universes come out of the Sadguru, and merge back into him after aeons. This is \ncalled Mahapralaya. When the universes disappear in Mahapralaya, they are no longer in \nGross form, but they remain within the universal mind. Every individual Gross mind rests in \nthe universal mind. Though this is all an illusion, still, the individual souls of all beings that \ninhabit the universes remain within the universal mind. And after aeons, the evolution \nstarts again, and every jeevatma (individualised soul that has not yet realised God) \ngradually takes form in accordance with the consciousness he had before the cosmic event \nof Mahapralaya occurred. \nFor example, in deep sleep, you are unconscious of both your body and the world. For you \nthis is dissolution or pralaya. When you awaken, creation begins again for you. You come \nback, and the world is again existing to you. This is individual dissolution, but the \nMahapralaya happens universally. It is the same as individual dissolution, only all universes \ndissolve, so it is called Mahapralaya, maha meaning great. Briefly, this happens every day in \nan individual's sound sleep state. And after ages and ages it happens universally. For this \nreason, it is said in the Koran, 'On Doomsday, everyone will rise up from his grave.' \nNow I will explain to you about Ishwar. Ishwar is the creator, preserver and dissolver as \none: Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. This Ishwar is God, but does not know himself. He is in \nthe state of infinite unconsciousness. However, he knows how to create, preserve and \ndestroy the creation. How is this? When you blow up a balloon, your eyes are on the \ninflating of the balloon, and so you look at that and not at yourself. In the same way, the eyes \nof Ishwar are fixed on his creation, and not on himself. \n2 December 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p988-989 \nAs previously explained, there are an infinite number of worlds which have cooled down. \nAnd for each such world to cool down takes cycles and cycles - imagine how long! But when \na man attains Realisation, and ascends to the seventh plane, he feels as if only a second has \npassed. That is, no time has actually passed during the numberless changes of forms, and \ndeaths and births of 84 lakhs - eight million, four hundred thousand times. Now I know that \naccording to you, it accounts for billions of years, and there is no limit to accounting. But my \nexperience is that nothing has happened, and there is no time spent. \nThere are seven worlds, seven skies, seven suns, seven moons, seven planes and seven \nheavens. Why this figure seven? And sanskaras too are of seven colors. Why? Because in the \nvery beginning when Energy (Pran) clashed with Matter (Akash), it created seven divisions. \nThe explosive friction between Energy and Matter created seven dazzling colors. \nEach individual human being is a universe unto himself. In the head there are seven \nopenings: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and one mouth. In the body there are seven \nparts: two arms, two legs, two openings (front and back), and one trunk. But all this \nexplaining of the universe and creation relates to the hair, and has nothing to do with the \nhead. So first try to get hold of the head, because out of it comes everything. (Baba drew a \nman's head and hair.) The barber's work is to shave the head. And who is the barber in this \ncase? Mahapralaya. For when it occurs, all the hairs - universes - on God's head are shaved \noff. It is said that the universes pour out of the Godhead. They are like God's hair. Your head \nmay symbolise God, and your hair the universes. \n23 December 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p997-998 \nWhen Energy (Pran) clashed with Matter (Akash) four things appeared - fire, water, air and \nearth - in quick succession. Stones, metals and vegetation have connection with earth; \nworms with earth and water; fish with water; birds with air; animals with fire; and human \nbeings with all elements. By fire is meant lightning. Lightning is everywhere, but it is \ncovered by a layer of ether. It has direct connection with animals, and so their digestive \npowers and sexual forces are strong. They frequently eat, and have sex often, to such an \nextent it seems as if they are born only for eating and sex. In man, this lightning assumes an \ninward force as the power of the human mind - thinking. \nThe first worm form after the vegetable kingdom is totally green in color. The last worm \nform is the crab. It is found in moist earth; that is, it goes in water too. It has become a fish, \nand therefore seeks water. In birds, you will mark that some species have an affinity with \nwater. These are the first forms after fish. The next most advanced forms of birds have \naffinity with air, and the last-most bird forms with the earth, such as roosters. After that is \nthe kangaroo form, the first form of animal life. And the last form of animals, as you can \nguess, is the monkey or ape. \n27 December 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p999 \nThe speed of the revolving of the universe is so tremendous that it is impossible to tell \nwhether it is spinning in motion. \nLook how many people, creatures and inanimate things there are in this world. Every \nperson and thing has a pulse. Everyone has thoughts - hundreds of thoughts per minute. If \nall of these thoughts of the whole mass of humanity and all other living beings in the world \nare put together, no one would be able to measure or think of them. The amount is so \nmeasureless. \nSuch tremendous speed has no calculable speed. It looks as if it is at a standstill. The pulse of \nthe whole universe is so infinite; but this pulse I measure, I observe and I feel. Think of what \nit must be... \n30 December 1928, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1132-1133 \nThe sun that gives you light at present will burst after many crores (tens of millions) of \nyears. But another sun will take its place. The earth is getting cooler, and will eventually \nturn into a moon. But another planet, just like the present earth, will take its place. What has \nbeen in the past will be in the future. The processes of evolution and involution will go on \nforever. Ignorance and creation go hand in hand. \n15 February 1929, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1140 \nQ. You say that there is nothing but God. But you cannot deny that matter exists. \nBaba: Yes, I do. I deny that matter exists. There is nothing but God. \nQ. But Baba, you cannot prove that matter is nothing. I see my physical body and your body \nwith my own eyes. How can you expect me to believe that matter does not exist? \nBaba: To your mind matter exists, but only so long as your mind is working. When you are \nin sound sleep, matter does not exist to you. How then can you say that matter is real? It \nstands to reason that it is entirely dependent on the workings of your mind. It is an illusion, \nnothing more nor less than the work of your mind. \nSuppose when it is pitch dark and you are walking somewhere, you happen to see an object \nand jump back, concluding that it is a man, whom you take to be a robber. You become \nfrightened, but fortunately see another man walking toward you. Both of you decide to \ncatch the thief. You cautiously approach the object, but no sooner do you begin beating it, \nthan you discover to your surprise that it was not a robber, but a boulder. It was a mere \nstone, but until you discovered this, to your mind it was a robber. \n(One of the Mandali pointed to a stool, and asked Baba if it wasn't matter) \nBaba: To you it seems to be matter, but to me it is atma, a soul. What you call matter is \nnothing. When I was a boy in Poona, one of my friends was named Kaikhushru. He was an \nIrani who used to make and sell ice cream. He was in the habit of taking bhang (hashish \nmixed in milk), and once after drinking some, he went to sell ice cream. On his way there \nwas a small puddle, hardly half a foot wide. But to Kaikhushru that puddle was a lake. He \nactually ran and jumped ten feet over it in order to cross it. Now, if you had said to him, \n'This is not a lake, but a tiny puddle,' do you think he would have believed you? He would \nhave called you mad. To him it was a lake. Similarly, to you, all this before you is matter. But \nto me it is nothing. \nJust as matter does not exist in your sound sleep, so it does not exist in my awake state. \nWhat you experience unconsciously in the sound sleep state, we God-realised persons \nexperience in the awake state. Our awake state is real, but yours is false. When you realise \nGod, you will see for yourself. The existence of matter is due to the existence of the mind. \nWhen the mind disappears, matter also vanishes. \n28 March 1929, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1148 \nThe evolution of creation has seven stages. There are seven planes and seven types of \ndesires. All these sevens should be eradicated once and for all. However, the number seven \nis significant. There are seven types of sanskaras, seven types of colors, seven types of \nflights of imagination, and seven types of sounds. The reason all these have seven variations \nis that in the beginning of creation, with the start of the original whim in the Beyond Beyond \nstate of God, there was a clash between Matter (Akash) and Energy (Pran), and Energy's \npowers were divided into seven forces. \nThe original sound coming out of the creation or Om point, also turns into seven sounds. \nThis higher music of the Mental and Subtle planes is indescribably sweet. Even if you \nlistened to it for twenty-four hours without a break, you would not tire of it. It is \nenrapturing. One absolutely drowns in its melody. But remember that in the Mental and \nSubtle sphere, the sweetness of this music's sounds are only shadows of the original sound. \nIn the Gross world the shadow of this melody is again divided into seven parts. Only expert \nsingers can express these tones and octaves. Sound is created by contact between two \nthings. When you speak, your voice passes through seven veils. But you do not notice this \nbecause the sound comes so quickly. Your physique, a byproduct of your sanskaras, \ndetermines whether your voice is sweet or harsh. \nEverything is made up of seven: seven subdivisions of the first Subtle plane (the Astral), \nseven stages of evolution, seven planes and seven heavens in involution. \n12 January 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1264 \nToday I will tell you something I have not told before to anyone -- how the  first Circle was \nformed. \nThere is one indivisible ocean of existence, and only one. All energy, space, light, power, life, \nlie latent in this ocean. Now when the creation comes out of the creation point, it manifests \nin duality, because this is quite opposite to the ocean. The ocean being one, the opposite is \nmany. \nEverything exists in duality when coming out of the creation point - good, bad, weakness, \nstrength - all this lies beyond the creation point. So first, in the very beginning, although this \ncannot be said to have a beginning, two drops expressing this duality came out of the ocean, \nand both evolved equally up through stone form, metal, etc. Energy manifested in vegetable \nform, and the two drops, having the same form and the same energy, faced each other in the \nprocess of evolution. \nNow in the very beginning energy was quite pure, and so a sort of tremor or irritation \nbegan. That is to say, the two energies in these drops of the same quality and quantity, \nfacing each other, attracted each other. And the attraction of the energies toward each other \ndrew the forms together. There was still no intellect, no feeling, no emotion, and yet union \nwas caused. This is termed purwasunk, the sex union without the sex existing - original \nsexless union. Now when they went on evolving and got the animal form, the energies \nincreased, and the impressions of the union in the vegetable form then evolved into instinct. \nAnd instinct acting on energy created the primal sexual passion. \nThe soul has no connection with this. The soul remains quite aloof, and this is all the \noutcome of energy and instinct moving together. The animals do not feel as human beings \ndo, they do not love each other a bit, but passion is in full force. Even attachment to their \noffspring is not love, as some eat their children, some neglect them, and so forth. This is not \nlove or feeling, but only attachment due to passion existing. \nNow when the two drops got the highest animal form, just prior to the human form, full \nconsciousness came, and the consciousness overpowered the energy. And what happened \nwas that the two energies became one, and the two forms became one. So the two drops \nexisted in one form. That first human being having two selves in one form and one energy \nwas Baba - the beginning of the Avataric period. In that Avataric period begins that first \nhuman being who had full consciousness, but no Self-consciousness, because impressions of \nhis previous lives were in his mind. \nNow full consciousness acting on that energy created emotion - to such an extent that it \ncould not control itself. All desires for sex were in full sway as the two were united. So this \ndouble energy got divided again. The first human being had to undergo seventy-seven \nforms. And in the seventy-seventh form the two-in-one life split, and the link broke, and the \ndrops became separated. And as they divided, they got quite the opposite form, and feeling \nand sex now really appeared... \nAs these two drops have only the impressions, emotions, etc., of previous times, and nothing \nmore, they quickly began to reincarnate. And as they incarnated they got 120 connections, \nor forms, some closely connected and others not so close. And then they united and child \ncame. As only these previous impressions - and nothing more - were there, the first human \nform went up by itself, being pure, and the 120 were drawn up with it. Thus the Circle of \n120 realised itself. So whenever this - Baba - comes down, the 120 come down with him. \nFeeling and emotion are only the creation of mind and energy. Love is the creation of the \nsoul. \n(Baba explained later:) \nThe process of evolution up to the reincarnation point is natural. It goes on systematically \nlike a spiral. All forms are in a circle, and when the two drops united in the (first) human \nform, that was the end of the process of evolution. So it stopped, and the momentum \ndiminished at the seventy-seventh form. And when the momentum finished, then began \nreincarnation. There was no leaving the world before. \nAfter my having become Realised many times, I came down as Avatar with you all \ninnumerable times. Only in the last cycle, 5,329 times. And once more after 450 years. The \nend will be the 5,330th time, although the universe is never finished. \nSo I am both personal in impersonal, and in the impersonal, too, I am conscious. The \nunconscious ocean is Baba, in the conscious drop is me, and also in everyone I experience \nmyself consciously. \nOne very important point is the seven stages of evolution. There are 8,400,000 main stages \nof changing forms. Masters can count 84 lakhs. It is in the book I have written, which I wrote \nin Meherabad in a little room. This I will give to the world after I speak. \n(two days later:) \nUp to the vegetable form there is no mind, no intellect, but in the vegetable form the energy \nis complete. It is called cheyenya, which means energy. In the animal form the first stage of \nintellect appears in the form of instinct. You are the same, unchanged in all these forms. \nWhat changes is the form, the consciousness and the experience of the universe. In the last \nanimal form (man) instinct is developed into intellect... \nCertain animals have inside intuition and inspiration. But as they are not fully conscious, \nthey do not know what they are. Kangaroos can experience wonderful sights and colors, but \nare not fully conscious, so they do not grasp. \n20 April 1933, \nKashmir, \nHM p451-454 \nIn the beginning there was oneness amongst all creation. This gave way to manyness. But \nnow manyness has almost reached its zenith, and it is time to return now to oneness, but a \noneness with consciousness, whereas before there was no consciousness or awareness. \n1933, \nKashmir, \nAw 22:1 p76 \nThe Moon, which gives us light at night, was once an earth just like our Earth, and there are \na number of such cooled-down earths. Millions of years ago the condition of our Earth was \nquite different from its present condition, and millions of years hence, it will be just like the \nMoon. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \nbefore September 1933, \nSi p23 \nScientists understand evolution from the first life to the last human life, but none knows \nwhy this evolution of forms takes place. \nAfter human life, what is there? The scientists know nothing. It is all due to the evolution of \nconsciousness that forms evolve. For example, take the body as consciousness and clothes \nas the body. Now, the size of this shirt is according to your body. If a hand is cut off \ntomorrow, the shirt might be minus one sleeve. So it is due to consciousness that the body \nchanges. \n(About the beginning of plant life:) \nThe ocean was very warm and still, and due to the presence of gas and air in the water, it \nbecame rusty. Algae was formed from this rust, then gradually seaweed. The algae used to \nsink below from above. When it reached the bottom of the ocean, it became seaweed. From \nthe original algae came seaweed, and from seaweed, vegetation. \n(About early reptiles:) \nOne of the first Gross forms of reptiles had three heads. It was about 175 feet long and 14 \nfeet wide. The middle head was about six feet in circumference. The three heads were \njoined together. The side heads were about two feet in circumference. Its front part \nresembled a reptile and its back a fish. The front was stout and the back portion thin. Its \nbelly was ten feet round and tapered to a breadth of six feet at the tail. The middle head \ncontained a jaw with teeth, just like the fish, but the side heads had only holes connected \nwith the gills, and no teeth. All three mouths were connected with one another, and when \nbreathing they breathed simultaneously, as it had one windpipe. Each head had an eye, so \nthe creature had three eyes. \nFrom prehistoric times birds have two eyes. They come under a different class, having \nevolved out of and beyond worms and fish. One bird is so peculiar that no one can have any \nidea of it, even in his wildest imagination. This bird is half bat, and very large -- about 15 \nfeet high. It has two legs like an ostrich. Its neck is about two feet in circumference. Its head, \nhowever, is small --  only about two feet -- when compared to its body. Its wing-spread is six \nfeet. Its beak is like a vulture, the end being thick and the point being thin. \nThe 'missing link' is a creature exactly like a gorilla, but with a short tail. And whereas the \ngorilla uses its hands while walking, the 'missing link' walks on its feet. His face is like a \nchimpanzee's, and his figure and gait of walking are like the gorilla's. After this 'missing \nlink,' the first human form evolves (it is physically or sexually a eunuch). Scientists may find \nsigns of this so-called 'missing link' in Java, Sumatra, or the Indian jungles of the central \nprovinces in Madhya Pradesh. \n(About cycles of time:) \nOne cycle is twelve thousand million (12,000,000,000) years. The scientists do not know \nanything at all about cycles, but this hint will open their eyes. The evolution of the world \nbegan two billion years ago, and evolution, which started from the nebula, will last until the \ncompletion of the cycle -- when the Mahapralaya (the total dissolution of the universe) will \ntake place. \nThe human form has been evolving for millions of years, and will continue to evolve. After a \nbillion years, man will only be five inches in height at the most, but will be very brainy. In \nthe beginning of this cycle man was 14 feet tall and would live up to 300 years. \nFrom the nebula came the four elements, though they were not produced simultaneously. \nFirst came heat, then crust, rocks, and lastly water. \nWhat is there in the universe? Billions and billions of nebulae. Every nebula contains \nmillions of worlds, and ours is the Earth. \nWhat is there in the whole universe? It is gas in its 276 Subtle states. Before gas turns into \nthe first manifestation of the Gross, it evolves through 276 Subtle stages. None of the \nscientists knows about these 276 Subtle forms of gas before its first manifestation in the \nGross. Subtle gas very gradually turns into Gross form such as hydrogen, oxygen, etc. In the \nnebulae, in all heavenly bodies and in the planets there is evolution. All of evolution begins \nfrom the nebulae. The 276 Subtle stages begin from the beginning of the nebulae, which are \nat the source of Subtle energy (Pran) and Subtle space (Akash). \nThe gas left over after cooling turned into air; and there is no air 100 miles beyond our \nEarth. This means that, even before the elements -- not before heat, but before water -- the \nelectron and proton evolved, forming the atom. \nIn the beginning our world was very, very hot. After slowly cooling down, what happened? \nAll the gas was solidified. As the planet became cooler, a crust formed. With the gradual \ncooling, the earth's crust became solid, and the center remained hot. Rocks were formed \nfrom the crust. The center was full of gas and extremely hot. There are natural gaps in the \ncrust, because the formation of the rocks was not regular. \nWhat happened then was, when the gas became cool it turned into liquid, and this liquid \n(water) seeped in between the rocks. Rocks were turned into mountains and the valleys, \nand the cool gas (water) filled them. This created the oceans and the seas. And evolution of \nform begins with the oceans. \n23 May 1934, \nMeherabad, \nLM5 p1871-1873 \nQ.  How did the universe come about? \nBaba: Universe, if understood as created, has an entirely different meaning from our \nviewpoint that the universe does not exist. Actually, it is only God who appears as the \nuniverse. But it is necessary to creation to have this dual idea of God and universe. To know \nthe exact meaning of the awake state, one has to experience the dream state. Dreams can be \ngood and bad. In a dream you can suffer or enjoy. But when you wake up, you find it was all \na dream. But this dream should be so adjusted that it awakens you soon. Sacrifice, character \nand selfless service help in waking you soon. \nEurope? \n1930s? \nA p47 \nThe whole world is created and carried on by the force of the imagination. \n1930s? \nAw 10:4 p 1, \nalso PL p32 \nI can see the creation and dissolution of universes very clearly. I can count them, even \nthough they are numberless. They are quite clear to me. Only the Avatar and Perfect \nMasters can see them with their Gross eyes - no one else can. People would think it a \nwonderful sight. But for one who has realised God and experiences eternal bliss every \nmoment, the universe is nothing. \n31 May 1935, \nBombay, \nLM6 p1959 \nIf you see Chanji with your Gross eyes, you see his figure _ no circle, no colors surrounding \nhim. But if you concentrate and can see him through your Subtle eyes, you can see his Astral \nform without color or mark, a faint form, a bit blue or grayish. If, however, you have \ndeveloped Mental consciousness and see him through your Mental eye, you see him in the \nform of a circle with seven colors, all blended together in one... \nColors are due to sanskaras created by imagination. Why seven colors? When the first clash \nbetween Energy and the Heavens or Space (Pran and Akash) took place, it created a spark, a \ncircle which had seven colors. All such sparks have seven colors. No one knows that even \nbefore the electron, there is one form in the beginning. But what name to give it? The clash \nof Energy entering Space created this first form. \n11 July 1936, \nRahuri, \nLM6 p2021 \nThe universe is tiny. It comes out of a tiny point, called the Om point, and grows bigger and \nbigger and bigger, and then smaller and smaller. \n13 April 1937, \nNasik, \nAw 16:2 p46 \nWhat a vast illusion! Millions of worlds, tiny and huge ones. There are no Perfect Masters in \nthe other worlds. \n(Of) four of these worlds (that) are inhabited, one of them is like this Earth, but with \ndifferent types of forms -- little forms. \nOnly this world, Earth, has Masters and Realised souls. These worlds are very near, yet very \nfar. When you understand the principle, it will be clear how near everything is, and yet how \nfar away. The other worlds are connected with this world, not actually, but they are. \n1937? \nAw 16:2 p52 \nThe existence of this whole phenomenal world is all due to your mind. It all exists because \nyour mind works. Once the mind stops, the world of phenomena ceases to be. \n15 May 1943, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p2876 \nAs soon as the self comes out of a tiny point, it descends in illusion and starts its journey in \nthe world. Even advanced yogis, with all their supernatural powers, remain under the sway \nof illusion. They are like ordinary persons, conscious of the shadow or reflection of the self, \nand not the self. But as soon as they disentangle themselves from the allurements of the \nplanes, they return to and enter the initial tiny point from which the soul emerged on its \nlong drawn journey. \nAt this stage, the yogi experiences that the whole universe is coming out of himself. But as \nhe succeeds in going beyond this point (often called the Om point), he becomes completely \nunconscious of the whole universe. For him, there are no forms, only the eternal reality. And \nthere are no fleeting joys or sorrows, but only the abiding bliss. \nbefore 1948, \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, ST p74 \nIn the cosmogony of this universe, this Earth of ours has a special significance, being much \nnearer to the spiritual sphere. There are other worlds where much mental development is \nmarked. But spiritual progress really begins on this Earth. \nbefore 1948, \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, ST p116 \nAbsolute oneness prevails in reality. Space and time are but illusory. They are merely the \neffect of the reflection of God's infinitude. When man realises reality, the reflection, which \nhas estranged him from reality, vanishes, and he experiences the absoluteness of the \nabsolute oneness of God. \nc.1950? \nPL p17 \nIrene Coneybeare: Baba, how old is Adam? \nBaba (smiling): If I answer that the first man came on this Earth eighty-four million years \nago, what would that mean to you? \nBut the whole explanation will make you understand how the first man evolved, and how \nthis first-evolved man has been repeatedly, millions of times, appearing, not only on this \nEarth, but on millions of earths, and so he is ageless, timeless. But this has all to be \nexplained properly. \nThe book which I have personally written when I had just stopped speaking, and which I \nwrote in one year, and which now lies in the bank to be touched only when I order, explains \nthis point clearly. It is important for the world and the scientists to know, and therefore I \nhave explained about cycles, the position of the Earth for Realisation, the Earth dying and \nthe simultaneous evolution of another earth -- not any other planet. When was the first \nhuman being evolved, when was the first Realised being, whether the chicken or the egg \ncame first. All has been written in detail in that book. \n11 February 1953, \nMeherazad \nLM11 p4070 \nWho says God has created this world? We have created it by our own imagination. God is \nsupreme, independent. When we say he has created this illusion, we lower him and his \ninfinity. He is beyond all this. Only when we find him in ourselves, and even in our day to \nday life, do all doubts vanish. We then know him, and therefore have not even to think about \nhim. Do you ever have to think as to whether you are a man or a woman? The answer is no, \nbecause you know you are a man. So it is when we become God. Unless and until we \nexperience this supreme knowledge, it is all mere talk, reasoning, logic and theory. \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nBG p6 \nAlso Gl Feb. 1966 and Aw 1:2 p11 \nSince, in the very beginning, imagination gave a twist to substance, and importance to \nshadow, we, who are eternally free, find ourselves bound, having lost our original self in the \nmaze of illusion. Therefore, despite possessing infinite bliss, we have to experience misery, \nworries, doubts, failure and helplessness. When in a flash real knowledge comes, we are not \nwhat we seem, but are that infinite one. All worries disappear, because in reality sukh \n(pleasure) and dukh (misery) do not exist. To get rid of this persistent ignorance and to \nknow the true value of reality, we have to experience God; and God, who is the breath and \nlife of our lives, can only be experienced through honest love. \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nBG p6-7 \nGod in the Beyond Beyond state is absolutely independent of the world, is the source of \ninfinite power, knowledge, bliss, beauty and wisdom, but is neither conscious of these \nattributes nor of himself. \nGod in the Beyond state (Allah, Paramatma) is independent of the world, and yet is \nconscious of his power, beauty and eternity, but in this state does not express these \nattributes. He is eternal in the sense that he ever was, is and will be. \nWe imagine God was. Before that, he was, and still before that he ever was. Imagination \ncannot grasp and cannot reach the one who has no beginning and no end. So we logically \nconclude that this state is beyond imagination and understanding. \nIt is incorrect to say God is one. The idea of his being one limits him. He is infinite. To speak \nof him correctly is to say 'God is.' We can say this only with reference to his Beyond state, \nwhere there is no beginning, no end, and nothing exists but God. If God alone is, God is \nEverything, and in this infinite Everything, Nothing is latent. Thus Nothing also exists. Let us \nsee how this Nothing represents this universe. \nThe most-first imagining of God, which Vedanta refers to as Lahar and Sufism calls Guman, \nis the first urge in the beginningless Everything to know itself. As soon as this urge \nappeared, a beginning began, not of God, but of the urge that produced Nothing, which was \nlatent in God. What was the urge? It was to know 'Who am I?' As soon as the urge appeared, \nNothing was produced, and God, instead of knowing himself as God, began to experience the \nnothingness of Nothing. \nThis process may be likened to a man tickled out of his sleep into a gradual opening of his \neyes, a progressively full awakening. When he wakes up he sees the objects, the nothingness \nof the Nothing (God's shadow), and not himself. Passing gradually through seven stages of \nthe rise of consciousness, man, figuratively speaking, attains a full opening of the eyes, and \nsimultaneously the consciousness of a fully manifested universe, the shadow of God. \nShadow (Nothing) was latent in God. With the emergence of the urge, God did not know \nhimself as God, but experienced himself as shadow. Impressions (nothingness, germs of \nimagination and illusion) piled up in profusion, owing to the transition of the shadows \nthrough alternations of pain and pleasure, beauty and ugliness, births and deaths, etc. After \nattaining the human form, for God to know himself as himself, he has to traverse a journey \nof seven inner stages and yet retain full, open-eyed consciousness. For God to know himself \nas himself (through the medium of a human form), creation of forms and the consequent \nexperiences were necessary. \n(Baba illustrated this with the example of someone standing near a lighted lamp and seeing \nhis own shadow) \nSometimes you suffer, sometimes you are happy. You don't remember having gone through \nall the dual states of experience, of being man/woman, strong/weak, rich/poor, \nhealthy/sick, etc. It was all a dream. It will continue to be so until you become free. With \nGod's urge to know himself a beginning was made, so it has to have an end. Beginning and \nend, and all the paraphernalia of things and beings - the becomings - that go along with \nthem, are what constitutes the law of opposites. \nGod has no beginning, no end. The Nothing, which is latent in God, has a beginning and an \nend. God is not limited. Nothing has three states - Mental, Subtle and Gross. When Nothing \nmanifests, the law of opposites (bindings) manifests. This law is established in all three \nspheres. \nfrom notes of a talk by Meher Baba, July 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nGG4 p89-91. \nAnother version: \nGT p267-268 \nIn the Beyond state of God, the original whim made me sing, 'Who am I?' and all creation \nsprang up. And now I have to bear the burden of the entire creation. \nfrom notes of a talk by Meher Baba, \n20 March 1954, \nSakori, \nGG6 p30 \nGod is the creator, preserver and destroyer of the universe, which emanates from him, is \nsustained by him in his own being, and also is reabsorbed in him. God alone is real, and the \nuniverse is in the domain of illusion, even though it is the manifestation of God himself. \nThe world or creation comes out of the eternal and infinite being of God through the \ncreation point, which is referred to as Om. No one can attain lasting peace unless he \ncontacts and transcends this Om point. We therefore find the sacred symbol Om often \nappearing in juxtaposition with the world Shantih, which means peace. \nThe phonetic similarity between Om, Amin and Amen is suggestive of many things. The \nsacred words Amin and Amen are frequent at the end of Muslim and Christian prayers. They \nboth mean 'So be it.' Coming from a man, 'So be it' is a blessing or wish; but coming from \nGod, it is creation. Creation is God's Amin or Amen, i.e. an immediate and instantaneous \nfulfillment of his will into actuality. The Arabic word Amin comes from the root Omn, which \nmeans safety or peace, and thus Amin may be regarded as an eqivalent or at least a kin of \nOm, which is also associated with peace. \nAll prayers of different religions, such as Hinduism, Islam and Christianity have a reference \nto the creator. Creation is the greatest mystery with which all creatures, including human \nbeings, are faced. The mystery cannot be unraveled or fulfilled unless and until man \nconsciously becomes united with the creator, and realises himself as being one with God, \nwho is both the creator and creation in one, at once including and transcending both in his \ninfinite being. \n1956? \nBe p18-19 \nLust means a craze. Some have the lust for power, some lust of the senses, etc. The whole \ncreation came out of lust. The first whim was lustful. God had intercourse with himself \nthrough the Om point, and the creation was the result of this act. \n1960, \nPoona, \nAw 22:1 p40 \nOnce I spoke a word and the creation came into being. Once again I will speak one word, and \nall will be over. In between there is only silence and love. \n1960, \nPoona, \nAw 22:1 p66 \nGod is infinite, and his shadow is also infinite. The shadow of God is the infinite space that \naccommodates the infinite Gross sphere, which, with its occurrences of millions of \nuniverses, within and without the range of man's knowledge, is the creation that issued \nfrom the point of finiteness in the infinite existence that is God. \nIn these millions of universes are many systems with planets, some in gaseous states, some \nin states of solidification, some which are stone and metal, some which also have vegetation, \nsome which also have developed life forms such as worms, some also fish, some also birds, \nsome also animals, and a few also have human beings. \nThus it is that throughout the myriads of universes, there are planets on which the seven \nkingdoms of evolution are manifested, and the evolution of consciousness and forms is \ncompleted. But only on the planet Earth do human beings reincarnate and begin the \ninvolutionary Path to Self-realisation. Earth is the centre of this infinite Gross sphere of \nmillions of universes, inasmuch as it is the point to which all human-conscious souls must \nmigrate in order to begin the involutionary Path. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p22 \nAs the highest of the high, I am the wisest of the wise. Yet I have allowed myself to perform \nan act more foolish than any fool ever would. What is this foolish act of mine? Creating the \ncreation. Creation is really a mighty joke. But the laugh is at my own expense. And now the \njest is proving a burden on my chest. Sometimes I am so tired I feel like going to sleep for \n700 years. To the fool, a foolish act is most natural and effortless. But can you imagine the \nmost wise exerting himself and stretching out to perform an act which is opposite to his \nattribute of wisdom? That is why I say you can have no idea of what I mean when I say I am \ntired. It is beyond human understanding. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p63 \nThe infinite alone exists and is real. The finite is passing and false. The original whim in the \nbeyond caused the apparent descent of the infinite into the realm of the seeming finite. This \nis the divine mystery and the divine game, in which infinite consciousness forever plays on \nall levels of finite consciousness. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p70 \nThe original real Everything is infinite and eternal. Being everything, it accomodates within \nitself the original real Nothing. Nothing is the shadow of Everything. \nThe substance (Everything) being infinite and eternal, its shadow must also be infinite and \neternal. At times the shadow appears to be small, and at times to stretch into huge shapes. \nBut even when it seems to have disappeared, it is still within the substance latently. \nOut of the Nothing contained within the Everything is projected infinite and eternal \nnothingness - the creation, or false everything. \nThe original real Everything is one, infinite and eternal. The original real Nothing, being in \nthe real Everything, is also one, infinite and eternal. But the false everything that is \nprojected from the real Nothing, comprising innumerable nothings, or all things in creation, \nis innately and unendingly dual. \nWithin these nothings are innumerable temporary nothings, such as, \nWhat is the matter with you? Nothing. \nWhat did you eat? Nothing. \nWhat is in your hand? Nothing. \nWhat do you see? Nothing. \nAnd so there is no end to the action and reaction of the experience of nothingness by the \ninnumerable nothings of false everything, which are projected from the one original real \nNothing, which is infinite. \nThe original real Everything is infinite and eternal. In it is the original real Nothing. \nInnumerable nothings manifest out of the one original real Nothing. And from these \nnothings is a continuous flow of temporary nothings. And so there are nothings and the no-\nthings of nothing within the one original real Nothing. When you compare these nothings \nwith the one original real Nothing, they are indeed nothing. \nNothing is in everything. Everything would not be a complete whole without Nothing. \nThe Nothing that is in Everything gives birth to nothing that seems everything. Because \nNothing is, everything seems to be. \nAll activity everywhere in creation is but a play of everything and nothing. When there is a \ncomplete cessation of this activity, the Nothing prevails. When this Nothing is attained, you \nhave Everything. Relatively, therefore, the Nothing is Everything; whereas that which we \ncall everything is nothing. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p85-86 \n(this explanation was accompanied \nby a diagram not reproduced here) \nGod is infinite and eternal. And his imagination is also infinite and eternal. God's \nimagination is unending, and the creation, which is the product of his imagination, goes on \nendlessly expanding. How can man imagine this imagination with his finite imagining. His \nhighest flights of imagination - intellect - can never bring him the faintest idea of God's \nimagination. And God's reality is beyond this again. When you cannot imagine even the \nimagination of God, how infinitely more impossible is it to fathom his reality? \nIn what is called space, numberless universes are continuously created, sustained and \ndestroyed. This procession of creation continues so long as God goes on imagining. And \nwhen God's imagination is suspended, as it is at moments in eternity when God withdraws \nhimself into his sound sleep state (just as a man's imagination ceases when he is in deep \nsleep), the creation is withdrawn and dissolved - Mahapralaya. \nCreation, preservation and dissolution are based on ignorance. In fact there is no such thing \nas creation, so preservation and dissolution never actually occur. The very cosmos has no \nfoundation save that of ignorance. Ignorance believes: the cosmos is a reality; birth, death, \nold age, wealth, honor are real. Knowledge knows: the cosmos is a dream; God alone is real. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p87 \nAstronomers speak of time in terms of billions, trillions and aeons of years. Even these \nfigures are not adequate for their mathematical calculations, and they may be required to \ncoin new terms. If I were to try and explain in astronomical terms the beginning and end of \ntime, it would never depict the beginning and end of time in eternity. There is always an \n'ago' and there is always an 'after' to every point in time. The yesterdays of the past and the \ntomorrows of the future hinge on a point in time which is the now of the present moment in \neternity. \nIn a flight of imagination, imagining the beginning and the end of the now of the present \nmoment in eternity, one can at the most either add or subtract a measure of time. But this \nwould be nothing more than an adding or erasing of zeros. No amount of swing, even of \naeons of cycles in the sweep of time, can give an iota of concept of any beginning or end of \nthe now in eternity. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p90 \nReality is existence infinite and eternal. \nExistence has no purpose, by virtue of its being real, infinite and eternal. \nExistence exists. Being existence, it has to exist. Hence existence, the reality, cannot have \nany purpose. It just is. It is self-existing. \nEverything - the things and the beings - in existence, has a purpose. All things and beings \nhave a purpose, and must have a purpose, or else they cannot be in existence as what they \nare. Their very being in existence proves their purpose. And their sole purpose in existing is \nto become shed of purpose, i.e., to become purposeless. \nPurposeless is of reality. To have a purpose is to be lost in falseness. \nEverything exists only because it has a purpose. The moment that purpose has been \naccomplished, everything disappears, and existence is manifested as self-existing self. \nPurpose presumes a direction, and since existence, being everything and everywhere, \ncannot have any direction, directions must always be in nothing and lead nowhere. \nHence, to have a purpose is to create a false goal. \nLove alone is devoid of all purpose, and a spark of divine love sets fire to all purposes. \nThe goal of life in creation is to arrive at purposelessness, which is the state of reality. \nc.1960, EN p100 \nEverything in the universe is, and from the beginning has been, a materialisation of the \ndivine original whim working out irrevocably without default, deflection or defeat. It is the \nunfolding upon the screen  of consciousness of the film of creation, sequence after sequence, \naccording to the pattern that issued from the original whim. However, when God as God-\nman plays the part of audience, he can alter or erase at his Avataric whim any thing or \nhappening which was destined from the original whim. But the very arising of the Avataric \nwhim was inherent in the original whim. \nc.1960, India, EN p106 \nGod is indivisible one, and is indivisibly in each one and everything. \nWhat is it then that causes apparent divisions? There are no divisions as such, but there is \nan appearance of separateness because of ignorance. This means that everything is of \nignorance, and that everyone is ignorance personified. \nA drop in an ocean is not separate from the ocean. It is a bubble over the drop that gives it \nan appearance of separateness. But when the bubble bursts, the drop is not, and the \nindivisible ocean is. \nWhen the bubble of ignorance bursts, the self realises its oneness with the indivisible self. \nc.1960, India, EN p111 \nWhen the first whim surged in God in the beyond state, he felt the urge of 'I want to know \nmyself.' In this first desire was embodied the first binding which manifested into form, and \nin this process, the first urge abbreviated simply to 'I want.' The soul has forgotten that the \nwant really is to know the Self, and so through countless forms it continues to feel only that \n'I want.' It is only in the last phases of the involution of consciousness that the Perfected \nman remembers that he actually is God, who had wanted to know himself. \n1960s? EF p45 \nI am so infinite that I myself cannot fathom my own infinity. My shadow, the creation, is also \nso infinite that once I tried to see with my Gross eyes all that had come out of me, but I \nfailed. Scientists will soon discover a little of what I say. There are 18,000 worlds that are \ninhabited by human beings. In some the people are extremely intelligent, in others less, and \nin still others still less. None of them who live in these worlds have any experience of the \nSubtle world. People from those worlds must be born on this earth to experience the Subtle \nand Mental worlds. \nMu p575 \nThere are 18,000 worlds in creation which are inhabited, some by human beings with 100% \nintelligence, others with lesser and varying degrees of it. \nBut the value of our Earth, where mind and heart balance, is inestimable. For it is here and \nhere alone that one can go through the process of involution and experience the Subtle and \nMental spheres, here alone that God-realisation can be attained. \nThus it is that souls (jivatmas) from other inhabited worlds finally take birth on this earth \nfor their emancipation, more so during the Avataric advent when the highest spiritual \nbenefit is gained, and most so when the Avataric manifestation is greatest. \nHence the present influx of population on earth is but the natural outcome of the rush of \nmigration from other worlds, and the ones migrating from the worlds of highest intelligence \nare responsible for carrying science to the peak it has reached today. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, Mu p529 \nAll this has been recurring since timeless ages, in a never-ending tide and ebb. Even this \nEarth expends itself in time, and another such earth takes its place. Science will soon come \nto know a little of what I have said. \nMu p529 \n(About the Unhad-Nad, the limitless sound or word) \nThe emergence of this sound through what is called the Om-point, or its creative utterance, \nproduced the worlds of mind, energy and matter. \n1960s? Aw 11:3 p2 \n... I have explained about the four journeys. They are journeys within. There are also outer \njourneys. The creation is based on gas, and gas is nothing, and nothing is. Mind is the \njunction between the inner and the outer journeys. There are two outlets, the inner and the \nouter. The outer (creation) is nothing but the shadow of reality. Just as your shadow is \nbecause of you, so the creation is because of reality. Mind is that which gives substance to \nmatter and energy. If you do the outer journeys, there are infinitely vast fields in space \nwhich contain millions of universes with innumerable suns. There are 18,000 worlds in \ncreation with human habitation... \nScientists will someday have to come to agreement among themselves that there are \ninnumerable expanding and contracting, evolving and dissolving universes. Just as \naccording to varying conditions, a shadow is sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller, so it \nis with the galaxies. How can the mind imagine the limitlessness of creation? It cannot. Why \nnot? It is because we try to understand with the mind that which is beyond the mind. Mind \nand energy are absolutely nothing. Hence all these universes which the scientists find so \nastounding are also nothing. \nNow, on the other side of mind, the inner side, there is shorelessness. You cannot pinpoint \nanything or any direction in it. No universes, no galaxies. Then what is there? Who is there \nin your sound sleep? Nobody. Only the is-ness is there. It all means that the goal is to be fully \nawake in sound sleep. Which is impossible without my grace. \nc.1963? \nAw 9:4 p20, \nalso HM p394-395 \nBaba: Who created God? \nHoshang Bharucha: God was, God is, and God always will be. \nBaba: God was, but how did God come into existence? God himself created God, and so he is \ncalled Khuda. This fact cannot be understood with the mind, but can be experienced only \nwith the real knowledge. \n1 June 1963, \nGuruprasad, \nAw 10:1 p27 \nThe Nothing came out of the Everything. From this Nothing came out this everything called \nthe creation. The Nothing appears to be Everything. \nThus, when one crosses the sixth plane to reality, one has necessarily to pass through \ncomplete emptiness, i.e. the Nothing. The experience of this emptiness cannot be described. \nSadgurus and Majzoobs have all passed through this experience of the emptiness. The \nexperience of this emptiness is of a very short duration, for the pilgrim at once passes to the \nFana-Fillah state of 'I am God,' and experiences himeself as God, the Everything. \nFor the Perfect Master, who has regained normal consciousness, the Nothing becomes his \nUniversal Body. From this Universal Body, everything of the creation is projected and \nabsorbed, chewed and spat out incessantly. \n6 June 1963, \nGuruprasad, \nAw 10:1 p33 \nThe Ocean of Everything and the Ocean of Nothing were lying still as one in the bosom of \nthe Beyond-Beyond Ocean. Then, without reason, without warning, without substance of \nany kind, a whim arose in the Ocean of Nothing. That whim gave rise to a question, 'Who am \nI?' And as Nothing asked itself that question over and over again, 'Who am I? Who am I? \nWho am I?' movement began in the Ocean of Nothing. \nNothing is nothing, without substance. Therefore its movements and whims are without \nconsequence. But over ages and ages, that movement in the Ocean of Nothing created an \nimpact on the Ocean of Everything, and that Ocean of Everything slowly awakened. When \nthe Ocean of Everything was finally awake, it asked itself only one question, 'Who am I?' \nAs soon as it asked itself that one question, it gave itself the only answer, 'I am God,' and \ninfinite consciousness was established in the Ocean of Everything. \nBut the poor Ocean of Nothing! When it heard Everything's question 'Who am I?' it did not \nknow that answer. Thus infinite unconsciousness was established in the Ocean of Nothing. \nNothing did not know the answer to Everything's question. But the impact of that question \non Nothing was so great that Nothing tried to answer it in innumerable ways. Thus creation \narose in the Nothing, and the point at which Everything's question was heard in the Nothing \nwas the Om point, out of which innumerable questions and answers poured into the Ocean \nof Nothing. \nAll movements took place in infinite unconsciousness, as infinite consciousness cannot be \naffected by anything, since it knows everything. God's state of infinite consciousness is \nnamed Parabrahma-Paramatma in Vedant, Allah in Sufism, and Yezdan in Zoroastrianism; \nthis is the state of the Father. This divine state is of infinite consciousness, of Paramatma \n(conscious God). In this divine state, Nirvikalp, soul is conscious of being God. Paramatma is \nin the conscious Beyond, so God is not conscious of illusion (creation). Paramatma is not \nconscious of being everything and everyone, for infinite consciousness is beyond \neverything. \nGod's state of infinite unconsciousness is named Ishwar in Vedant. Ishwar has three \naspects: Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver), and Mahesh (the dissolver). Thus all \ncreating of creation, all preserving of creation, and all dissolving of creation occurs within \ninfinite unconsciousness, the domain of Ishwar. \nIn the beginning of time, infinite consciousness was established as the divine state or seat of \nimpersonal God (who had no consciousness of illusion). This seat of God is called Ars-e-\nMaula, and this divine state remained to be realised, or the seat remained to be filled, until \ninfinite consciousness was gained through the medium of infinite unconsciousness. \nNot only did infinite unconsciousness want to realise infinite consciousness, but infinite \nconsciousness itself wanted to be realised... \nThe infinite Ocean in the Beyond-Beyond has Everything and also Nothing. It has infinite \nenergy (Pran) and infinite space (Akash). The Om point is in Everything, from which the \nbeginning of Nothing took place as the evolution of everything that was latent in the original \nOcean. The Ocean has knowledge, but it is unaware that it contains knowledge; that is its \noriginal ignorance. \nWhen the Whim surged, surf formed in the Ocean of Nothing, and every drop in that ocean \nbegan asking, 'Who am I?  Who am I?' With the advent of this surf, there was friction \nbetween Space and Energy, and a most powerful clash occurred, creating movement, which \naffected the Everything. This effect was that every drop of the Ocean of Everything began \nasking 'Who am I?' This movement caused ripples in the Ocean of Everything, and on \naccount of the Whim, the evolution of consciousness and unconsciousness simultaneously \ntook place from the Om point. Thus the two states, infinite consciousness (Paramatma) and \ninfinite unconsciousness (Ishwar) were established. \nThe Ocean of Beyond-Beyond God in the beginning was absolutely serene and still, without \nthe least movement. The Whim, that Lahar or Hukki, arose in the Ocean of Nothing, and \nNothing asked itself, 'Who am I? Who am I?' for ages and ages of time. It took aeons and \naeons for Everything to awaken from its sleep, so unimaginably deep and sound was it. Until \nEverything awakened fully (infinitely) and asked itself 'Who am I?' and answered 'I am God,' \nthe states of infinite consciousness and infinite unconsciousness were not established, and \ncreation did not begin. \nIt is of this interim time that I now speak, the ages and ages, the aeons after the Whim, and \nbefore Everything awakened fully to tell itself 'I am God' (therefore, knowing itself), and \nestablished the states of infinite consciousness and infinite unconsciousness, Paramatma \nand Ishwar. In this time before creation began, original Fire (Tej), in infinitely finite form, \nmanifested in the Ocean of Nothing, and this original Fire manifested before that time. \nThe Whim gave rise to this Fire, and this infinitely finite original Fire gave rise to infinitely \nfinite Energy (Pran). Energy, even in such incredibly finite form, required Space (Akash) to \nmanifest. Simultaneously, Space manifested with Energy, and instantly there arose conflict \nbetween these two. \nThe conflict between Space (Akash) and Energy (Pran) created movement, and over aeons \nof time this movement in the Ocean of Nothing, created by the powerful clash between \nSpace and Energy,  awakened the Ocean of Everything from its oceanic deep sound sleep. \nAfter Everything awakened and spoke, 'Who am I? I am God,' infinite consciousness was \nestablished, and infinite unconsciousness was established. \nOnce infinite consciousness was established in the Ocean of Everything, the movements in \nthe Ocean of Nothing did not effect it (Paramatma), and only infinite unconsciousness \n(Ishwar) was affected by these movements. And as infinite unconsciousness was affected, \nIshwar began to create, preserve and dissolve. \nWhen the question of Everything, 'Who am I?' was heard in the Ocean of Nothing, Nothing \nbegan saying, \"I am this, I am that,' and creation began to issue forth drop by drop out of the \nOm point into the Ocean of Nothing. \nMovements are what cause things to come out into creation, and nothings go on manifesting \nad infinitum in response to movements. And what were movements? Nothing but the false \nanswers that Nothing gave to the original question, 'Who am I?' \nThe conflict between Energy and Space was the prime instigator of all these movements. \nBecause of this friction, Fire (Tej) issued forth into creation first (and energy as its \nderivative), then Space (Ether), then Air, then Water, and then Earth. These are the five \nelements, tatvas (the substances that constitute life), which manifested in seed form in the \nMental world's planes, in Subtle form in the Subtle world's planes, and in Gross form in the \nGross world as universes of suns, stars, moons and planets. \nThe existence of the illusory things of creation (in the Mental, Subtle and Gross worlds) \ndepends upon these five elements, tatvas, which are combinations of gases... \nEnergy (Pran) and Space (Akash) clashed before creation, and continued to clash after \ncreation, all because of desire. In the time before creation, Fire, Energy and Space \nmanifested near the Om point. These forces arose out of the Whim. But out of that Original \nWhim also surged seven major desires which poured into the Ocean of Nothing before and \nafter creation. These seven desires pervade the Mental world (seed form), the Subtle world \nin Subtle form (germination), and the Gross world in Gross form (action). Mankind knows \nthese desires as lust, anger, greed, hatred, pride, selfishness and jealousy, and these desires \npervade all creation. Consequently, at every stage of life you will find this figure seven has \nsignificant meaning because of the pervading seven major desires. \nEnergy which activates movements has seven divisions (states), so the movements of \ncreation also have seven divisions, seven waves with seven states of surf foam. The \ndivisions of movements are so subtle (fine) that they are unseen, since the movement is \nexceptionally rapid. Ripples are the repercussions of movements, and because there are \nseven divisions in movement, there are seven divisions in ripples, seven states of waves \nwith the surf's foam (bubbles). Thus the purity of the Ocean as creation unfolds \nimperceptibly. \nWith the movement of the Ocean of Nothing, waves arise and the surf foams, forming \nbubbles. Every wave has innumerable drops, and every drop has a bubble around it. This \nbubble is of the drop, and nothing but the drop. And because of the bubble, the drop seems \nseparate from the Ocean. Bubbles are of two kinds, wave-bubbles and drop-bubbles. The \nwave-bubbles are as the Gross universes, and the drop-bubbles are as the Gross forms in \nthe universes from stone to human. \nIn the Ocean rise infinite waves with numberless bubbles, and every big wave-bubble has \nnumberless small wave-bubbles (universes). This means that with the rippling in the Ocean, \ninnumerable Gross worlds were created. Out of these innumerable planets, seven are \nnearest to the Om point, the very nearest being our planet Earth. This is the reason why God \ndescends on Earth as the Christ, Prophet, Buddha, Messiah or Avatar. \nThe whole Universe, containing millions and millions of universes, is in the throes of \nchange, and continues to evolve, and so the seven planets near the creation Om point also \nchange and evolve. \nThe greatest opportunity for the development of mind, of heart, of consciousness, is on the \nworld nearest to the Om point, where spirituality is at its height (involution). Involution \noccurs only on one planet in the whole universe at any time, and that planet is now Earth. \nEach drop-soul begins and ends its journey in involution here. When the world nearest the \nOm point cools down (spiritually dies), the world just behind it spiritually takes its place in \nall respects. \nOn account of the waves in the Ocean, infinite nothings come out of the Ocean of Nothing, \nbut in unimaginably limited form. These nothings, Jeevatmas, individual drop-souls, are the \ninfinite shadows of the Everything (God)... \n... From one Paramatma, innumerable shadows are born as its opposite, and these shadows \nare the shadows of shadows. The light (original Fire Tej) that came out of God's effulgence \n(Noor) is the shadow of that effulgence, and the shadows of this shadow are the \ninnumerable shadows. The infinite number of suns, moons and stars are the shadows of the \nshadow of the light of God. \nThe state of God that exists in the movement of the Ocean is the state of Ishwar, creator, \npreserver and dissolver. It is only in movement that the acts of creation, preservation and \ndissolution can unfold. Due to this movement, innumerable waves and ripples happened in \nthe Ocean of Nothing, whereby wave-bubbles (universes and Gross worlds) and drop-\nbubbles (forms from stone to human) arose. \nSince energy has seven states, and energy activates movements, so movement and its \nripples (repercussions of movement) have seven states of stir. Six states of stir in the Ocean \ncreated a bubble of energy around each drop. But the stir (movements, whirl) and the \nbubble are so subtle, and the movement is so exceptionally rapid, that both are absolutely \nunseen. The seventh state of movement created the bubbles that are seen (these bubbles \nare the Gross forms of evolution). \nIn the first six states of the movement (in the two Mental planes and four Subtle planes) the \nindividual drop-soul has a covering (bubble around it) of mind and energy. However, in the \nseventh state of movement, the drops's covering changes, and it becomes a bubble of mind, \nenergy and Gross form; this is Jeev. Every drop is the ocean itself, but because of the bubble, \nit thinks it is only a tiny drop. \nThe creation of the Gross bubbles is the Gross continuation and accentuation of the original \nfriction between Energy and Space, for Space is now in Gross form, and Energy is expressed \nin form. Consequently, the conflict between Energy and Space is at its height in the Gross \nworld. (This is seen as the constant explosion of novae, the constant evolving of planets in \nthe throes of change.) \nSome drop-bubbles remain latent in the six states of the oceanic stir. They remain \nstationary in the Mental or Subtle planes with only bubbles of mind, or bubbles of energy. \nSuch drop-souls with only bubbles of mind are called Archangels, and they exist in the \nMental world. Drop-souls with only bubbles of energy are called Angels, and they exist in \nthe third Subtle plane. Archangels have a Mental body, but no Gross form. They have Mental \nconsciousness without sanskaras. Angels have a Subtle body, but no Gross form. They have \nSubtle consciousness without sanskaras. \nAll other drop-bubbles which come out of the Nothing pass into the seventh state of \nmovement, the Gross world, to journey through evolution, reincarnation and involution. \nThis journey has a purpose - it ends in an answer. The purpose is to attain Everything, and \nthe answer is 'I am God' to Everything's question 'Who am I?' \nMovement in the Ocean gave rise to infinite numbers of universes and creatures as it \nmanifested in the Mental world in seed form (pure mind), in the Subtle world in Subtle form \n(pure energy), and in the Gross world in Gross form (pure matter). But all the things and \nbeings which were born out of movement (the original stir) take aeons and aeons to assume \nGross form as they create themselves through all seven stages of evolution. \nStones, metals, vegetation, worms, reptiles, fish, birds, animals and human beings have not \ncreated themselves suddenly. Creation is for this purpose: the development of \nconsciousness. And for the development of higher consciousness (intelligence) exists \nillusion (maya), which is the necessary medium for this purpose. For the sake of this pure \ninfinite intelligence (infinite thought), all the seven stages of evolution and involution have \ncome into being. When this intelligence is attained, all of creation is known as illusion, as \nnothing. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \n1968, Meherazad, \nNE p28-38 \nThe state of infinite unconsciousness named Ishwar or Ahurmazd does not experience God; \nmeaning Infinite Intelligence (Apar Vidya) in the state of the Creator does not experience \nitself (as conscious God). Only the Brahmi-Bhoots or Paramhansas or Jivanmuktas and the \nSadgurus experience God consciously, meaning they realise themselves to be God. Infinite \nIntelligence is their own consciousness. \n... \nSagun Bhakti, perceptible devotion, or devotion to the Perceptible One, is worship of Ishwar \nor Ahurmazd. If this worship is offered for worldly gain or material need, then Ishwar \nfulfills the desire or want of the worshipper. But if the worship is offered to attain God-\nrealisation, then through Paramatma (the infinite consciousness) the worship delivers the \nseeker into the hands of the Avatar or Sadguru, and he worships the Master. Ishwar, the \ninfinite unconsciousness, can fulfill desires, but having no experience of infinite \nconsciousness, Ishwar cannot make others experience God consciously. \n... \nIn the state of Ishwar or Ahurmazd, the Infinite Intelligence cannot experience its soul, \nbecause in the state of Ishwar or Ahurmazd Infinite Intelligence is not relating to the soul, \nbut is in relation with the universes... The states of Ishwar or Ahurmazd, the infinite \nunconsciousness, are states of God concerned only with creation; they are not concerned \nwith realisation of God. \nWhen Infinite Intelligence begins thinking, everything begins. As it thinks enormously, then \npowerfully, and finally infinitely, Infinite Intelligence turns into infinite thought, the infinite \nthought of the infinite thinker, but with the most finite formless imagination. \nSimultaneously the infinite mind turns into the most finite mind, and creates Gross, Subtle \nand Mental worlds and beings. \nInfinite Intelligence first thinks most finitely as creation emerges, and through this finite \nthinking of imagination, it experiences most finitely that which it created (thought). With \nthe commencement of thought, Infinite Intelligence becomes Ishwar (infinite thinker), and \nits thought creates Mental, Subtle and Gross worlds by the act of thinking infinitely from the \nmost finite point, the Om point. \nThus imagination is most finite in the beginningless beginning, and develops with the \ndevelopment of the limited mind. In man, mind being fully evolved, imagination becomes \ninfinite. Imagination is false, but imagination itself is the medium for the Infinite Intelligence \nto experience its reality: its infinite real mind. \n... \nIn Infinite Intelligence is contained infinite thinking, and the most fine finite imagination. \nWhen the infinite thinking starts, the most limited, most fine finite imagination assumes \ninfinitely Mental, Subtle and Gross forms. \nIn the beginning of creation when infinite thinking starts, the infinite thinking assumes \nextremely great and yet most limited form at the same time. \nBy thinking then, Infinite Intelligence commences playing two opposite parts: one of \ncreating imagination in extremely limited and most finite form as Mental, Subtle and Gross \nforms; and the other role of experiencing the Mental, Subtle and Gross worlds through \ninnumerable Mental, Subtle and Gross bodies. \nThis experience of its infinite thinking first begins in the Mental world as drops become \nArchangels, and in the Subtle world as drops become Angels, but the actual conscious \nprogression of its thought to experience the infinite first starts from the stone form in the \nGross world. The conscious experience of infinite thinking by Infinite Intelligence begins \nwith the first human form, and conscious infinite thinking begins as man enters involution. \n... \nOriginally there is nothing, absolutely nothing, the pure nothing, the formless, bodiless \nNothing. When this Nothing comes out and manifests through innumerable forms, then \nthrough false knowledge it becomes everything. Nothing is ignorance, and this ignorance \nalso comes out in countless forms. To take Nothing as everything is false knowledge, and it \nis this false knowledge that gives ignorance I-ness. Thus the combination of false knowledge \nand ignorance continues - the jeevatma (individualised soul), falsely thinking, takes itself to \nbe 'I' and takes Nothing to be everything. \n... \nIn the beginning, it was the breeze of the infinite whim, which from the most finite point \nstirred all that is unconscious and all that is conscious within infinity to find a way to itself. \nAnd from beginning to end, the interminable progression of imaginary forms remains as the \neternal constant. \n... \nThe universe and bodies (Gross, Subtle and Mental) are illusion, and cause imagination to \npersist (impress), but the soul does not know this because it does not know itself. The \nuniverse and bodies, 50,400,000 pre-human forms and 8,400,000 human forms, have come \ninto being out of each soul's not knowing itself. But on the basis of their existence, and \nthrough them, each soul can know itself. Through the medium of millions of bodies that \ncome out of the infinite unconsciousness of each soul, each soul knows itself. \nThus the creation goes on spreading out ad infinitum, for each soul creates infinitely out of \nits unconsciousness, out of its own unconscious Infinite Intelligence. The universe and the \nbody have come out of the nothing, and in the end the soul has no connection with them. \nSoul is the reality. The universe and its experience are a medium for the soul to know itself. \nNo sooner the soul knows itself, than creation and body are at an end, for as it is, they are \nnothing and soul is everything. For the soul to know itself, it has to experience everything \nthat is nothing (the total nothing experienced in Nirvan) before it can experience itself as \neverything. When the soul experiences itself as everything (the total everything experienced \nin Nirvikalp) it achieves its reality - its infinite effulgence, its infinite knowledge, its infinite \nintelligence. \n... \nPran is energy, the motion and power created by the process of infinite thinking. Akash is \nmatter, the material and substance which is created by energy, the force of thought. When \ninfinite thinking comes out of infinite mind, movements begin to surge, and the formless \nimagination (the formless creation) manifests in Mental, Subtle and Gross forms. \nThe most fine formless universe is made up of energy and matter linked together. The fine \nMental world is energy and matter together in seed form, and the Subtle and Gross worlds \nare the acting of energy (motion) on matter (material), that is, matter moves. As energy acts \non matter, each self creates Subtle and Gross worlds; in this condition, energy and matter \nare self-creating the Subtle and Gross forms constantly. The Gross body then is the same \nSubtle body in Gross occupation of physical action, which is Subtle energy in action (a \nmaterial form moves) \n... \nThe combination of energy and matter is the formless imagination or thinking state. When \none thinks, imagination (the formless creation) manifests in Mental, Subtle and Gross forms. \nThis means the original matter (Akash), which is the original imagination, becomes Mental; \nthe Mental becomes Subtle, and the Subtle becomes Gross. The thought of the Mental \nbecomes the energy of the Subtle, and the Subtle energy becomes Gross thinking. \nInfinite thoughts fill the Mental world, infinite energies fill the Subtle world, infinite \nmaterial forms fill the Gross world, and all this is the result of thinking. It is the motion and \npower created by thinking that is Pran, energy being the power of the thought or the motion \nof the thinking. It is thinking that creates creation; the Subtle and Mental worlds are the \nmanifestation of universal energy and universal matter through the infinite thinking mind, \nIshwar. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \n1968, Meherazad \nNE p203, 205, 214-215, 279, 282, 289,   291-292, 305-306 \nFor more on Creation, see 'Shri Meher Baba, His Philosophy and Teachings,' 'Discourses,' \n'God Speaks,' and 'The Nothing and the Everything.' \nCreation Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

This is an \nexcerpt: \n\"In the beginning, either show an ocean of dazzling light without any shore, or a deep, deep \ndarkness which gradually vanishes into hollow emptiness. From this darkness, or dazzling \nlight, comes a point of projection - a tiny point of light appears. From this point come Akash \n(full space) and Pran (primal energy). These two come together with a clash. \n(Here Baba gave four diagrams \n- see LM5 p1874) \n\"From this whirling chaos, the Subtle sphere comes into existence; then the primal elements \nof fire, water, air and earth, nebulae, and millions of heavenly bodies.

Then our solar system and our earth is formed, bubbling over with very, \nvery hot gases and liquids. \n\"The earth is to be shown forming a crust as it cools, and uneven rocks, gaps in the middle, \ngas liquefying, and all the liquids evolving into oceans. From the ocean, evolution begins \nwith algae and seaweed. Show the different forms for evolution: from electrons, minerals, \nalgae, to the vegetable kingdom and the formation of the major species - seaweed, \nmushrooms, grass, neem trees, spinach; then fish, birds, animals, the 'missing link.'

    "text": "DEATH \nMeher Baba \nThe greatest warriors, scientists, doctors and astrologers, without exception, have to bow to \nnature's common law, death. \nOctober 1922, \nLM2 p431 \nLower spirits are those beings without physical forms whose sanskaras remain to be wiped \nout. They cannot progress after death until their unfinished sanskaras are worked out. As a \nconsequence, they wander about on the lower Astral plane. For this reason, they are a \nsource of harassment to living people. \nSuppose a man is destined to have a life span of forty years, but he commits suicide when he \nis thirty. Consequently, for the remaining ten year period of unexpressed sanskaras, his \nspirit inhabits the lower planes, and at times is seen by some people as a spirit or ghost. To \nhold seances or to talk with the dead is no great thing, because such spirits are always \namong us on this living plane. \nThere are advanced yogis and munis who converse with these ghosts who have committed \nsuicide, as well as with the spirits of the higher planes. These advanced souls communicate \nwithout using a medium. They live on both levels. \n2 June 1925, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p720 \nMeher Baba discussed the death of his brother Jamshed with his men Mandali: \nBaba: I often told Jamshed not to leave Meherabad, but he persisted, and now he has really \nleft. Do you feel badly about his death? \nThey said yes. \nBaba: All this grief is false. It is meaningless. It is hypocrisy. It is not genuine at all and is \nselfish. \nQ. But from the worldly point of view, everyone feels sorry when someone dies. \nBaba: But why? That is where the mistake is made. Death is false. \nQ. But he was your brother. Is he not dead? \nBaba: He was indeed my brother. But he is not dead. On the contrary, he is at peace, resting \nwithin me. Hence I don't feel sad at all over his death. \nQ. But how are we worldly people to know and appreciate this fact? \nBaba: You can know, but only by trusting, having deep faith, and believing those who know \nthe secrets of life and death. All say that by submitting to death, my brother Jamshed has left \nthis world, and that is quite true. But all this hustle and bustle and noise of the world is \nmomentary, and when the show is over one has to depart. \nBelieve me, Jamshed is not dead. His body has died. Everyone thinks he is dead, but I say he \nhas taken birth. The joy expressed by people at the birth of a child should be expressed \nwhen a person breathes his last, instead of all the show of sorrow, grief and sympathy. This \nis sheer ignorance, and those who understand the secret of birth and death feel sorry at this \nhypocritical pretense. \nIf you had divine sight, you would be fully convinced, and see for yourself that after the \ndropping of the physical body, the soul, which is always immortal, is always there. And \ndeath does not make the slightest difference in this as you believe. \nEveryone is feeling that Jamshed left this world in the prime of life. But one has to go sooner \nor later, and no one but God knows the right moment. How can you say he was young? He \nwas thousands of years old, and God knows how many births he will take on this earth. \nWhatever you saw before your eyes was only the Gross form of Jamshed, and its absence \nmakes you weep with sorrow for him. If you wish me to be a partner in your dense \nignorance, forget it. \nDeath is common to all, and it is a necessary step forward toward real life - eternal infinite \nexistence. The soul merely changes into a new abode; thus dying is nothing more than \nchanging your coat. Jamshed has changed it after experiencing life in it on this plane. It is \nlike an actor who plays different parts in different dramas, or changes costumes in the same \nplay behind the curtain, and then reappears on stage in a different garb; or it can be \ncompared with sleep. \nThe difference between death and sleep is that after the former state, one awakens in a new \nbody, while in the latter state, one becomes conscious of the same body. Worldly-minded \npeople do not become upset when a person goes to sleep at night, simply because they \nexpect to see him awaken alive again the next morning. Then why not exercise the same \nindifference when he sleeps the sleep of death, since he is bound to awaken alive sooner or \nlater in a new body? \nYou at times travel in a train, and other passengers, without a care in the world, depart at \ndifferent stations such as Lonavla, Kalyan and Dadar, all according to their tickets. In the \nsame way, Jamshed was traveling, and when he reached his destination, according to his \nticket, he departed from the train - left his body. His station was nearby. But according to \nyou he has passed away in his youth. The trains go on running day and night, and \nnumberless passengers travel in them, and depart at different stations according to their \ntickets. How many are you going to weep over? \nThus it is the selfishness of not being able to satisfy their minds in the absence of the sight of \ntheir dear ones that makes people weep and wail, and not so much the death itself. After the \ndeath of a person, a hue and cry is raised from all sides: 'My beloved father or mother is \ndead! The source of my life is gone! The light of my eye is dimmed! Where is my sweetheart? \nMy support has disappeared!' Such exclamations are heard in the house of death. But in \nspite of a great display of grief and pain, my and mine remain uppermost, rather than \nconsideration for the welfare of the one who has passed away. \nThe sword of death has been swinging freely since the beginning of man's history. Every day \nI see hundreds and thousands of my brothers dying, without feeling anything for it, and \nJamshed's death is no exception to this. All admit that death is unavoidable, the unavoidable \nend, and though the fact is universally acknowledged and experienced, at the time of its \nhappening, people immediately start crying. It is either madness or weakness of the mind. \nNothing lasts, everything is indefinite in this world, except the jeevatma (individual soul) \nwho is subject to births and deaths. Even Perfect Masters and Avatars leave this world when \ntheir duty is over, so what to say of ordinary souls? This come-and-go game, the alternating \nexperiences of life, and gathering and spending of sanskaras, is really quite difficult to \nunderstand. \nMost people generally do not believe in the principle of karma, and are firmly convinced \nthat there is no other body. The very thought of reincarnation, of another body, makes them \nshudder and shake. They say that once one is dead, he is dead, and there is no rebirth, in the \nsame way that dry wood does not turn green again. \nIt will be a pleasant surprise if Jamshed is really dead. But he is not. If he were really dead, \nall should rejoice over it, since it would mean real life for him - eternal, infinite existence. \nUnless we really die, meaning our ego is annihilated, we cannot realise divinity. So all this \nexpressing of sorrow and regret is bunk. \nAlthough you find me moving about among you, playing with you, and in fact doing all that a \nsupposedly living man does, I am really dead. I am truly and really dead, though I seem alive \nand active to you. If you die once, truly, there will be no more life and death for you, since \nyou become one with God. Because I am dead I am alive. As Kabir says, \nEveryone says, 'I am dying' but none of them die. \nOnly he who is dead before dying has not to die again. \nThese are the words of Kabir. Die such a death that you will not have to die again. Die, all of \nyou, in the real sense of the word, so you may live ever after. The stopping of breath and the \nabsence of pulse are not real dying. It is no use letting your earthly body die; all your desires \nand longings should die. That is, seek out the death of maya first and become sanskara-less. \nThen alone you will have died the real death and have been born into eternity. \nAn earthly being who realises God can be said to have earned real birth. All the wise ones, \nholy ones, Sufis, saints, Pirs and Prophets, by surrendering every worldly thing to God, have \nreached the goal, union with God. So do such acts that will earn you freedom from the \nrecurring rounds of births and deaths. \nWhen you understand this, what is the use of sorrow and weeping? If you have love for the \ndead, it should be selfless. The dead do not want your expression of sadness. Manifest such \nlove for them that they would be pleased and at peace. If you want the consciousness of \ntheir souls to progress, express selfless love. Do not make them unhappy by your weeping \nand wailing. \nJamshed was my brother, but I am Jam Sheth - the Master of Death. The same death has \nbrought Jamshed to his Master. Jamshed is near Jam Sheth. So give up this worthless \nconduct and be absorbed in your duties. Do not have the idea that because Jamshed is dead \nthe world is dead. \nHe who is convinced that after death there is birth again never worries or sorrows. What is \nthe use of sorrowing over dried up crops in the field? By dying after death, and thereby \nannihilating the mind, you will gain both worlds. Otherwise it is a never-ending cycle of \ntaking birth and dying. There is no escape. It is a matter of luck, fate. \nWhat can we do when our last day dawns? It is not in our hands, so what can be done? We \nall have to go one day. So what is the sense of weeping? One can do nothing except submit to \nGod's will. \n27 February 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p779-783 \nOther versions: \nPM p95-96, SW p272-273, \nAv p103-104 \nWhy should we Sadgurus feel for the shocking wounds and mutilations that are horrible to \nlook at? Do you feel anything while killing an ant, gnat or mosquito? Not a bit. Do you feel \nbadly when a hen's neck is being cruelly wrung by a butcher? No. Then why fear and shiver \nat this human murder, the wounds, blood and pain? The ant, fly, hen and goat all have lives \nas humans have. Why feel for one and not for the other? \nJust as you consider the lives of these animals quite insignificant as compared to human \nbeings, so do the Sadgurus consider human deaths trivial and insignificant. For them, the \nwhole world is a small thing, just a point. Then why worry for a man being dead? Besides, to \nSadgurus, the dropping of a body is no death at all. It is simply dropping one form and \ntaking another. \nThe body is a coat covering the soul. Thousands and hundreds of thousands of such bodies \nfall daily, and the same number take bodies again simultaneously. The Sadgurus are really \ndead to illusion, and so are really living in eternity. So what is this dropping of human \nbodies and changing coats to them? \nThe mind must die, not the body. The body may die a thousand deaths; the atma (soul) is \nthere, alive; it never dies. Even when body and mind both are dead in the Realisation state, \nthe atma is there living forever. \nThe body lives, works and suffers for the mind, and the mind lives for the soul. \nFor example, take the cloth to be the body, the body to be the mind, and the mind to be the \nsoul. Now suppose a young, well-dressed maiden comes and stands before you. As long as \nthe clothes cover all parts of her body, the mind pays no special attention to her and is \nchecked. But suppose a part of her clothing flutters in the wind, uncovering her legs for a \nmoment. It immediately affects the mind, and several undesirable ideas begin to surge into \nit. \nNow what did this? The cloth - the body. Similarly, as cloth is to the body, so the body is to \nthe mind. That is, the mind is affected by the body, as the body is affected by the cloth. \n19? July 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p828 \nIn sound sleep, there is consciousness but no ego, while in the state of death, there is \nconsciousness plus ego. After the death of the physical body, the soul remains, together with \nthe limited ego, the mind, and the Subtle body. Only the outer garment has been left behind. \nFrom one to three days, the Subtle retains its connection with the Gross body, but never \nlonger than that. \nThere are four main conditions of existence after the final severance with the Gross body: \n1. Upwards \n2. Immediate reincarnation \n3. Heaven or hell \n4. Downwards \n1. Upwards: Only the spiritually advanced beings go upwards, that is, beyond and above the \nlunar sphere. There they stay until such time as they can reincarnate upon earth, since \nPerfection can only be realised in the Gross human form. During the interim, however, such \nadvanced beings can and do utilise the bodies of earth beings to work out a certain kind of \nsanskaras. \n2. Immediate reincarnation: Those whose good and bad sanskaras almost balance each \nother, but are not exactly equal - because if they were, such souls would at once attain to \nGod-realisation - reincarnate immediately on earth in human form. \n3a. Heaven: The person who has accumulated a large portion of good sanskaras, and few \nbad ones, experiences through the Subtle body the state called paradise or heaven. Here the \ncapacity for enjoyment is increased tenfold, and the sensitivity to suffering as the result of \nthe few bad sanskaras is proportionally diminished. In other words, in this condition there \nis practically no suffering at all, but only enjoyment, until all the good sanskaras are spent. \nHowever, the impressions of these sanskaras remain, and ultimately impel the soul to take \nanother body on earth. \n3b. Hell: One who has contracted many bad sanskaras during his earth life experiences after \ndeath the state called hell, wherein the susceptibility to suffering is increased tenfold, and \nthe capacity for enjoyment is proportionately diminished. In the hell state there is only \nsuffering, until all those sanskaras which induced this state are exhausted. The impressions \nremaining compel the soul to rebirth in a human body. \n4. Downwards: Those who have acquired extremely bad sanskaras, resulting from deeds \nlike murder for lust or greed, after death go downwards into the region of animal spirits, to \nawait a suitable Gross form for earth life. \nThe condition of one who arrives at death through suicide requires special explanation. \nSuch a one goes neither upwards nor downwards, neither does he immediately reincarnate, \nnor pass into heaven or hell. Such spirits remain suspended closer to the earth plane, \ninasmuch as no entry is possible for them in any of the aforementioned states. Their \ncondition is pitiable in the extreme, because they too feel the pull of their sanskaras, but \nunlike those on earth, they have no Gross body in which to fulfill their desires. These are the \nones which in common parlance we call ghosts or disembodied spirits. It is these spirits \nwhom mediums sometimes contact, and they prove a souce of harm as well as good. \nSometimes such a spirit tries to possess a human body with which it feels an affinity due to \nsimilarity of sanskaras. \nIf, for example, a person who is otherwise eligible for the heaven state commits suicide, he \nremains suspended near the earth plane, and if he comes in contact with a human being \ndoes him no harm. But if one who, through his bad sanskaras, was eligible for hell dies \nbefore his time, then he may become a source of harm and pain to those whom he contacts. \nThe relatively good spirits, however, usually seek redress through yogis, or they seek to \nserve a Perfect Master in the darkness of night. Yet, owing to the karmic law, it takes many \ncycles for such suspended spirits to have the chance of reincarnating again in human form \nthrough the aid of the Master. The evil spirits run as far away as possible from a Perfect One. \nBoth good and bad suspended spirits can sometimes work out their sanskaras through a \nhuman being, if they can find one with similar sanskaras and suitable past karmic \nconnections. However, the ignorant victims of such possession by a suspended spirit may \nsuffer physically and materially, though spiritually they are benefitted to the extent of \ndispensing with three or four incarnations. \n1926? \nMeherabad? \nAv p105-107 \nA person dies when his sanskaras are exhausted, spent in full. After a person dies, his \nsanskaras snap the mind's connection with the Gross body. And at that time he receives \nsuch a shock that he forgets every incident of his past life. But, even though the Gross body \ndrops, the mind and the Subtle body remain full of sanskaras. For the next forty to seventy \nhours after death, the attention of the sanskaras is centered mostly on the place where the \nbody is kept. But, after that, there is no connection whatsoever between the dead person \nand that place. Within the next eight or ten days, the spirit of the dead person experiences \nthe Subtle state of either heaven or hell, according to his sanskaras. \nAfter a person dies, many people perform rites and ceremonies for a long time. But all these \nare useless. No ritual is necessary after ten days. However, the best rites would be to feed \neither dogs or crows near the body, because they have Subtle sight and can see the spirit of \nthe dead person. Crows and dogs are not Subtle-conscious, but they have Subtle faculties of \nperception, and draw towards themselves the sanskaras of dead people. \n22 September 1926, \nLM3 p848 \nWhat the Astral body of an ordinary man sees and experiences after death, the yogis see and \nexperience during physical life. \nFour days after death, the Astral body rises up to gain pleasure or pain according to its good \nor bad actions in physical life. When the store of virtue (poonya) and vice (paap) is \nexhausted, the soul, in accordance with the faint impress of the sanskaras, takes another \nGross body - that is, is reborn in the physical world - which process goes on until the soul is \nfreed from the chains of birth and death. \nRarely, yogis of the fourth plane misuse their spiritual powers, and are reborn  in the stone \nstate, and have to go through the whole process of Gross evolution before again getting the \nhuman form. Otherwise no human being experiences a fall in the evolution of forms. \nThe human form is the best of all physical forms. It is the only form in which God can be \nrealised, and until God is realised, the soul must continue with births and deaths. \n28? February 1927, \nMeherabad? \nGM p69 \nYou eat food, and to keep yourselves healthy and fit, you pass out the residue as excrement. \nBut do you ever shed tears for the waste you eliminate? Do you ever think about it, or feel \nregret over it? Not at all. Then, if someone dear dies, why do you weep for that discarded \nbody, which is like food to the soul? \nYou preserve and protect your body to feed your soul. The body is the medium for the soul's \nprogress. When your excrement is eliminated, you eat fresh food. Similarly, with the \ndisposal of the old body, you take a new body. So why worry and weep over that which is \nthe law of nature and cannot be altered? \nSadgurus and the Avatar consider human death to be absolutely unimportant. They do not \nfeel sad about anyone's death. For them, the whole universe is a very, very small thing, a \nsmall point. The human body can be compared to the fibers on the outer shell of a coconut. \nHundreds of such hairs fall off, but the coconut water remains safe inside. Similarly, \nthousands of human bodies may fall, but the soul is immortal. It never dies. It is always \nliving and eternal. \nDecember 1927, \nMeherabad \nLM3 p994-995 \nSuppose a person dies, and his greater number of good sanskaras take him to the Subtle \nstate, to heaven. There he experiences, without a physical body, the result of his good \nsanskaras of his past life. Similarly, if he has a greater number of bad sanskaras, they take \nhim to hell, and he experiences those sanskaras without a body. In both cases the Grossness \nof either good or bad sanskaras is wiped out, either in heaven or in hell, and still the faint \nstain of these sanskaras remains in the mind. These are Subtle impressions. \nSuppose a dish of food overturns in your lap, and your clothes become soiled with spots. \nYou immediately remove or throw away the food, the Gross impressions, but the stains \nremain. These stains are like Subtle impressions. \nSanskaras remain connected with the environment where a person dies for two or three \ndays after death. Although they are disconnected from the environment after two or three \ndays, they are not spent either in hell or heaven for ten to twelve days after death. They \nremain unspent during this period. \n6 March 1929, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1147 \nIf a person dies by a sudden accident before he would have died naturally, he immediately \ntakes birth again and completes the remaining time of his past life, after which he dies. \nSome live for one, two, three, four or five years. And after finishing the period remaining \nfrom their past life, they take another body according to the sanskaras of the life which \nended suddenly by accidental death. However, they cannot live longer than it takes to \ncomplete this remaining time. This is why some children die, some in a few days, some in a \nfew months, and some after a few years. \nNovember 1929, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1255 \nIn a way, even an ordinary dream is also a subconscious experience of the Subtle, because \neveryone necessarily makes an actual use of one's Subtle body in the dreaming state. But be \nit noted that through that body one experiences different sensations and experiences \npertaining to the Gross only. In other words, the ordinary dreaming state is the \nexperiencing of the Gross through Subtle means in the subconscious state. \nOf course, the case regarding communications with the spirits of the dead is not the same as \nthat of the dreaming state. Just as a man in the ordinary dreaming state uses his Subtle body \nsubconsciously, and thereby experiences different sensations pertaining to the Gross \nsphere, so in certain cases a man can consciously use his Gross organs to get the \nexperiences of the Semi-Subtle sphere. And this amounts to being in a position to have \ncommunications with or get glimpses of the spirits of the dead. \nLet it be noted that spirit communication is the experience of the Semi-Subtle through the \nGross means in the conscious state. It is not at all a mark of advancement on the divine Path, \nas it has nothing to do with the gnosis, the Subtle sphere and the planes. \nThere lies a world of difference between the Subtle and the Semi-Subtle... The Semi-Subtle \nsphere is the link between the Gross and the Subtle spheres. The spirits of all human beings \n(with the exception of those who have gone beyond the fourth plane) come to this Semi-\nSubtle sphere, and according to sanskaras either go to heaven or to hell, from which they \nagain return to it, or directly await a new Gross body without necessarily being aware of \nthis, to reincarnate in the Gross sphere. \nIt is the spirits that are waiting in this waiting room of a Semi-Subtle sphere that are likely \nto enter into communications with those who are in the Gross sphere. They may be either \non the point of going to heaven or hell, or may have finished their terms of pleasure and \npain in heaven or hell, as the case may be. Or they may be directly awaiting reincarnation \nfollowing the last physical death. But it is only these spirits that can be communicated with, \nthough not quite always with a mathematical precision as believed by many. \nAs to the various descriptions of the conditions prevailing in the Semi-Subtle sphere and in \nheaven or hell that are purported to come from them, some of these are in some way or \nother true, but it is not proper to attach importance to them. The Semi-Subtle sphere, and \neven heaven and hell, and the respective happiness and sufferings in them, are not of real \nexistence. The experiences in the Semi-Subtle are like those in a dream. And heaven and hell \nare nothing but states in which the jivatma (individual soul), according to its good or bad \nsanskaras, experiences Subtle enjoyments and miseries respectively through the Subtle \norgans. When jivatma gets Self-realised, heaven and hell are found to have been imaginary \nexistences, just as one who in the dreaming state enjoys and suffers, finds the dream \nexperience devoid of reality when one gets up. \nIt goes without saying that worldly people can never enter into communication with higher \nspirits, i.e. spirits belonging to the Subtle, Mental and Super-Mental spheres. For though the \nspirits of the Subtle and also, in some cases, of the Mental sphere, have to reincarnate, they \ndon't have to stay in the Semi-Subtle sphere at any time. Spiritually advanced persons can, \nof course, communicate with advanced disembodied spirits, but they do not do so, for it is \nunnecessary. Spirituality has nothing to do with spiritism or communication with the spirits \nof the dead. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba before March 1930, \nIL p18-20. \nOther versions: ST p8-9, Tr p176-178. \nAs a result of ordinary physical death, although the Astitwa (Subtle body) and the Jiva (life) \ndo get separated from the Gross body completely, the connection of the mind is closely \nmaintained with the corpse for the first three days after death, and slight connection goes \non for seven days more. \nbefore July 1930, \nIL p40 \nIf anyone is executed by the government, he enters a state of samadhi. It is temporary. For \ninstance, when a person is being hanged, there is a clash during the execution between the \nfunctioning of inhalation and exhalation. Becoming lifeless, the person enters a samadhi \nstate. \nThis type of samadhi has nothing to do with anything spiritual, for as soon as this state is \nover, and according to the sanskaras of his past life, the soul takes rebirth. If he has \nmurdered anyone, he must pay for those sanskaras of murder. If the person is innocent, yet \nis executed, he is then freed from the sanskaras of murder. \nIt is quite different in the case of people who commit suicide by hanging. When a suicide's \nsamadhi finishes, he remains 'hanging' - waiting between the Astral and Gross worlds. The \nperson becomes a ghost, and does not acquire a physical body for ages to come. \n13 January 1931, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1353 \nDeath is like sleep. And as sleep is essential to man, so also is death a necessary part of life. \nIn reality, no one is born and no one dies. This is all a dream. And what worth does a dream \nhave? \n21 December 1933, \nMeherabad, \nLM5 p1853 \nSuicide is not the solution. It only entails rebirth with the same problems all over again. The \nonly solution is God-realisation, to see God in everything. Everything is easy then. \n31 December 1934, \nHollywood, California \nto Mercedes Acosta, \nLM6 p1940 \nAll want to die and to live. Ordinary dying is nothing serious or wonderful. It is like passing \nfrom one adventure to another, and every adventure needs a suitable medium - the body. If \nyou go to a party, you wear a dress suitable for the occasion. If you go to a wedding, you \nwear different clothes. If to a funeral, something suitable for that, and so on. So each \nadventure requires a suitable garment. Who takes death as very serious or awesome? \n... Just before death it is peaceful. Death appears so fearful, but it is usually the fear of the \nunknown, like an abyss you cannot gauge... But it is so ordinary, so simple. Every night you \ngo to sleep, you are dying, but you are not scared to enter this unknown, for at the \nbackground is the thought of waking up again. Death is also sleep, but you wake up in \nanother form, and the background of this death is complete uncertainty. When you sleep \nsoundly, the body is a corpse, but the link with the body remains, so you wake up in the \nsame form. When you die there is no longer the link with the body, so you wake up in \nanother form. This goes on from one adventure to another till you realise me. \nc.1937? LA p312 \nThose who die thinking of me come to me. They are Liberated from the chain of birth and \ndeath, and see me perpetually. \nMarch? 1939, \nLM7 p2409 \nAt the time of death, the soul drops its physical body. Therefore, after death, there is \ngenerally no consciousness of the Gross world, since Gross consciousness is directly \ndependent on the physical body. Though the consciousness of the Gross world is thus lost, \nthe impressions of the experiences of the Gross world are retained in the Mental body. And \nthey continue to express themselves through the Semi-Subtle sphere. During the interval \nbetween death and the next incarnation, the consciousness of the soul is turned towards \nthese impressions, with the result that there is a vivification of impressions, and the revival \nof corresponding experiences. The average man does not become aware of the Subtle \nenvironment. He is wrapped up in complete subjectivity, and he is absorbed in living \nthrough the revived impressions. \nIn life after death, the experiences of pain and pleasure become much more intense than \nwhat they were in the earthly life. And these subjective states of intensified suffering and \njoy are respectively called hell and heaven. Hell and heaven are states of the mind. They \nshould not be looked upon as being places. And though, from the subjective point of view, \nthey mean a great deal for the individualised soul, they are both illusions within the greater \nillusion of the phenomenal world... \nBut hell and heaven are both states of bondage subject to the limitations of the opposites of \npleasure and pain. And they are both states whose duration is determined by the nature, \namount and intensity of the accumulated impressions. Time in the Subtle world is not the \nsame as time in the Gross world, owing to the increased subjectivity of the states of \nconsciousness. But though the time in the Subtle world is thus incommensurable with the \ntime in the Gross world, it is strictly determined by the impressions accumulated in the \nGross world. However, the important fact is that the hell-state and the heaven-state are far \nfrom being lasting. And after they have served their purpose in the life of the individualised \nsoul, they both come to  an end... \nThus the hell-state and the heaven state become instrumental for the assimilation of \nexperience acquired in the earthly phase, so that the individualised soul can start its next \nincarnation in the physical body with all the advantages of digested experience. The lessons, \nwhich are learned by the soul through much stock-taking and reflection, are by the power of \ntheir magnified suffering or happiness confirmed on the mind-body. And they become for \nthe next incarnation part and parcel of the intuitive make-up of the active consciousness, \nwithout in any way involving the detailed revival of the individual events of the previous \nincarnation. The truths absorbed by the mind in the life after death become, in the next \nincarnation, a part of the inborn wisdom. Developed intuition is nothing but consolidated \nand compressed understanding, distilled through a multitude of diverse experiences \ngathered in previous lives... \nLike the earthly career and its experiences, the states of hell and heaven in the life after \ndeath are integral parts and incidents of that journey of the individualised soul, which is \nultimately meant to get to the source of all things. \nc.1942? Di, \nHell and Heaven, \nv4 p51-58 \nThe soul remains untouched and unscathed by the loss and the destruction of material \nthings and possessions; and death is only a gateway to further life. Those who would play \ntheir part in the divine game shall remain unmoved by any bereavements or losses; and \nthey shall also impart to others the spirit of cheerful resignation to the divine will. \nFebruary 1942, \nLM8 p2775 \nAlthough I am the formless one, I am destined to assume a human form again and again, and \nso I am here. But I wish for you to become free from the wheel of births and deaths, of being \nborn again and again: growing, maturing, marrying, enjoying, procreating, decaying and \ndying. \nGod is just as soft as he is hard, as compassionate as he is harsh. Just remember that when \nyou call on him or invoke him, if he is touched even once, the impossible then becomes \npossible and you become free. \n2 November 1952, \nMeherabad, \nGG3 p133-134 \nPeople die in all sorts of ways, but it is nothing to be upset about. They are born again and \nagain in different Gross bodies. But during one's lifetime, one should do whatever one \nhonestly feels without getting attached to actions. \nChanging bodies between lifetimes is similar to changing a coat. Some die young, such as \nthose who died at the time of the partition. Some live long lives, they do not change their \ncoats soon, like Gustadji. \n5 November 1952, \nMeherabad, \nGG3 p162-163 \nI am never sorry for anyone who dies. He who dies with my name on his lips, with me in his \nheart, never dies. I never worry about them, for theirs is no loss. If I am ever worried, it is \nfor those that suffer through the death, which they might allow to alienate them from me. \nThat would be their loss indeed. Why suffer unnecessarily? My dead live in me. That should \nmake you happy... \nKnowing this, any mourning you may do therefore must be for yourselves only, from selfish \nmotives. You don't know how fortunate they are who die with my name on their lips and in \ntheir hearts. \n1955, \nAL p94 \nAlthough I am taking my own name continuously, I have come to hear it repeated by my \nlovers. And even though I were deaf, I would hear it if you repeated it only once with all \nyour heart in it. If you cannot remember me constantly, then always take my name before \ngoing to sleep and on waking up. At least remember to remember me when you breathe \nyour last, and you will still come to me. But how will you remember at the last moment, \nunless you start to remember me right now? \nKammu Baba, whom many revere as a saint in Bombay, recently sent me word asking to be \nrelieved of his duties and to return unto me. I advised him also to take my name when \nbreathing his last. In his last moments, Nozher took my name. So did my brother Jamshed, \nand many others who have come to me. But it is only the heroes who come to me in their \nphysical form. To these, death itself surrenders ultimately. \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p45 \nNozher = Nozher Dadachanji \nIn reality, there is nothing such as death or birth. I know this, and I say it with the authority \nof my conscious knowledge. We are all in eternity, and we will always be there. Really, none \ncomes or goes, none is born or dies. But to experience this truth, we must first free \nourselves from the bondage of our ignorance. \nAfter a hundred years or so, you will all have dropped your bodies, and yet you will still \nexist. Do not think about your bodies, but think only about me. Then, before you drop your \nbodies, you will be able to remember me. My miracle will be to make you become me. \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p86 \nThe seers of all times have had direct access to the truth about life and death, and they have \nrepeatedly given a suffering and groping humanity useful information on this point. Their \nexplanations are important because they protect man's mind from erroneous and harmful \nattitudes towards life and death, and prepare him for perception of the truth. Although \ndirect knowledge of truth requires considerable spiritual perception, nevertheless even \ncorrect intellectual understanding of the relationships of life and death plays an important \npart in restoring mankind to a healthy outlook. Above incarnate life in birth and beyond \ndiscarnate life after death, the soul is one indivisible, eternal existence... \nEach incarnate life is an opportunity for the realisation of one's true self. Each death or \ndiscarnate life is an opportunity for achieving a semblance of balance to start another birth, \nwith its further chance at self-realisation. If the opportunity were fully taken, one incarnate \nlife could be sufficient to make the individual realise this goal. But it is well-nigh impossible \nto attain the initiative and longing to do so without getting involved in the illusory maze of \ninnumerable opposite experiences. The contact of a Perfect Master is invaluable in calling a \nhalt to the dizzy gyrations of incarnate and discarnate lives in illusion, and awakening the \nindividual to the real knowledge of self. \nFrom the psychological point of view, death entails no slightest curtailment of individual \nexistence. This does not mean that the surviving mind remains unaffected by the kind of \ndeath which severed the individual from the body. Both the condition of the mind, as well as \nits capability to progress further in the life after death, are often substantially determined \nby the conditions surrounding the death. \nFrom the standpoint of its psychic after-effects, death can be classified into three broad \ntypes: normal, abnormal, and supernormal. Normal death follows an illness which \nultimately renders the physiological functioning of the body impossible. Generally it \ninvolves some kind of warning to the individual, for if the illness is severe, he often \nanticipates that death is at hand. Although by no means true of all deaths caused by illness, \nwhen the individual has some anticipation of impending death, he usually has a chance to \ntie up loose ends and prepare his mind for this new crisis. \nThe second or abnormal type of death is that which results from accidents, murder, war and \nsuicide. In accidents and murder, there is generally no anticipation of impending death. \nBeing unexpected, death involves in such instances a shock which can shatter the very roots \nof the sanskaras seeking expression through the physical incarnation of the individual. In \nunanticipated accidental death, the ordinary ego-mind has a moderate tendency to gravitate \ntowards the Gross sphere and cling to it because of the ego-mind's attachment to the Gross \nworld. \nIn anticipated (abnormal) death, when resulting from murder or war, the ego-mind can \nbecome bound to the Gross world by the chains of unfulfilled revenge. There is less \ntendency for such binding to occur in death due to war, than in that resulting from murder. \nIn war the combatants on both sides are often impersonal in their actions, and aware that \nthey are fighting for some cause, rather than through personal enmity. If this awareness is \nclear and steady, death in war does not yield the mental reaction of revenge. \nAmong abnormal kinds of death, suicide deserves special attention. Suicide may be divided \ninto four grades: lowest, low, high and highest. The lowest type is a last measure in escaping \npunishment or ignominy or utter frustration after the individual has tried unscrupulously to \nsatisfy his own selfish desires. Thus one who has committed murder for lust or power may \ncommit suicide when he is caught. Even after leaving the body, such a person does not \nsucceed in severing his link with the Gross world for hundreds of years. \nThese individuals live literally as ghosts in the Semi-Subtle sphere, which lies between the \nGross and the Subtle world. They experience agonising suffering because of their unfulfilled \ndesires. Due to the link which they preserve with the Gross world, they continue to desire \nvarious Gross objects keenly, a desire which can never be fulfilled. This suffering is even \nmore acute than the intense sufferings in the hell-state* that the individual experiences \nafter he severs his connection with the Gross world. \n*Neither hell nor heaven should be regarded as places. They are mental states, and \nimaginary in the same sense that the world of duality also exists in the realm of illusion. \nA somewhat less acute class of suffering in imagination is experienced in the hell-state by \nsuicides who have been slightly better motivated, but who are still classified as 'low.' In this \ngroup are those motivated by sheer disgust with life. Thus a person suffering from bad \nhealth, or stricken by a loathsome disease, or one who is poverty-stricken and ashamed of \nbeing a burden on others, might put an end to his life through lack of will to live. Since the \ncause of such a suicide is revulsion from earthly life, the ego-mind does not continue to \nmaintain any enduring link with the Gross world beyond the normal three or four days \nfollowing death. After that normal period, the link is snapped, and the ego-mind then begins \nto experience the intense suffering of its bad sanskaras, usually termed the hell-state. \nAlthough a ghost caught in the Semi-Subtle sphere suffers even more acutely than does the \nego-mind experiencing the hell-state, the latter achieves some exhaustion of evil sanskaras, \nwhile the former does not. Further, the sufferings of the ghosts who maintain their link with \nearthly life are more tantalising, because the link constantly holds before them the prospect \nof fulfillment of Gross desires, without actual means for their satisfaction. \nThe general belief that suicide is bad is due to the fact that it is usually the result of low \nmotives and a cowardly attitude towards life. When suicide is employed as an escape from \ndilemmas brought on by failure to cope with the needs of life, it is not only ignoble, but far-\nreaching as well in its demoralising effects upon the victim. \nThe third or high type of suicide is in no way rooted in inferior motives, and is therefore free \nof their deteriorating effects. It is inspired by altruistic motives alone, and is a sacrifice \nmade to secure the material or spiritual well-being of others. One who meets death through, \ne.g. a hunger strike, in order to better the welfare of the masses, is a suicide of this high type. \nThe motives of such a suicide are not far different from those of martyrs who lay down their \nlives on the battlefield for country, society or religion. The total absence of base motives in \nthis high type of suicide makes it entirely different from the lower grades. As in other noble \nacts of self-effacement, such highly motivated action entitles the departed individual to the \nprivileges and pleasures of the heavenly state, and also constitutes a definite asset in his \nspiritual ongoing. \nA suicide inspired by ordinary altruistic motives is not the highest type. The fourth or \nhighest class results from intense desire to see God or to unite with him. This is an \nextremely rare occurence. In most cases in which suicide is believed to have been \ncommitted for the sake of God, there is an admixture of other motivating factors, such as \ndissatisfaction with conditions in earthly life. \nIf and when suicide is embraced purely for the sake of attaining God, it can have the effect of \nachieving Liberation or Mukti. The Masters have always warned aspirants against resorting \nto suicide in the intensity of their longing for union with God, for there is too great room for \nself-deception and inadvertent mixture of inferior unconscious motivation. \nRegardless of the abnormality of the circumstances which may lie back of it, no type of \ndeath can really damn the individual forever. It is never more than an incident in his long \nspiritual journey. \nThe third or supernormal type of death consists in leaving the body voluntarily. This is done \nby the advanced yogis who wind up their earthly careers after fulfilling their mission, much \nas the student locks up his textbooks after passing his examination. The supernormal or \nvoluntary death of the advanced yogi is definitely anticipated and willed, but is entirely \ndifferent from suicide insofar as motives, results and manner of leaving the body are \nconcerned.* \n(*Meher Baba explained later that there was one other kind of death, 'circumstantial death.' \nFor more about it, see 'Death' in Book Two.  -- Editor) \nFriends and relatives of a departed one often are seriously upset by his death, because the \ndissolution of the form may seem to them to be the extinction of life itself. All of their \nattachments had been related to the form. It was because of the form that they had contact \nwith the soul, and  it was through the form that their various physical and emotional needs \nwere fulfilled. The disappearance of the body that had acted as the vehicle of the soul is \ntherefore often interpreted by them as the annihilation of the individual himself. From the \npurely physical point of view, death does not involve annihilation of even the body, but \nphysiologically it has become unfit to be the continued dwelling place of the spirit, and has \ntherefore lost all importance. \nFrom the point of view of the individualised soul as mind, death does not involve any loss \nwhatsoever, as the mind and all its sanskaras remain intact. The individual in essence is \nthus in no way different. He has only cast off his external coat. Nevertheless this severance \nfrom the physical body is fraught with two important consequences. It is a means of \nintroducing the individual to a new type of existence, and it is also in itself an incident of the \nutmost importance because of side effects of the greatest practical consequence. \nWhen others die, the individual loses only one, or at most a few friends who have played an \nimportant role in his earthly existence. But when he dies, he loses at one stroke all the \npersons who had entered intimately into his own life. He also loses all his possessions, and \nis broken away from the achievements on which he had built the very foundations of his \nsense of accomplishment in life. As the crowning touch, he must also leave behind the very \nphysical body with which he had identified himself so completely that he was rarely capable \nof imagining himself as anything but that physical body. This complete annihilation of the \nentire structure of the individual's earthly existence is therefore a crisis without parallel in \nhis life. \nThis critical turning point, which occurs at death, is attended by both advantages and \ndisadvantages. The greatest disadvantage lies in the fact that the individual must leave \nincomplete all the undertakings of his earthly life. He must leave the entire chessboard \nwithout taking any further interest in it. The scene of his life is blotted out, and the chain of \nhis mundane interests is hacked apart. \nFrom the standpoint of objective achievement, the continuity of his undertaking has \nundergone an abrupt break. Advancement of the projects he has left behind must come \nfrom his previous associates, and can no longer be his concern. It is rare for the individual to \nbe drawn back through a sanskaric linking to the identical task which he had begun in a past \nincarnation, to develop it on from the point where his successors had left it. \nIt would be a mistake to think that death brings nothing but disadvantages. Death also \nbrings about a general weakening of attachments by shattering all the sanskaras which \nwere fed by the earthly objects, because the mind is now torn away from them. While it is \ntrue that many of the sadhanas undertaken by the individual during his earthly life have the \neffect of unwinding previous sanskaras, still it is only in extremely rare instances that he \nsucceeds in completely erasing the present and future effects of these sanskaras. This \nerasure is effected within certain well-defined limits by the sudden transplanting of the \nindividual that occurs at death. \nIf the lessons inherent in a single death were to be thoroughly assimilated by the individual, \nhe would benefit by the equivalent of several lifetimes of patient spiritual effort. \nUnfortunately, this does not happen in most cases, because after death the individual \nusually tries to revive his accumulated sanskaras. Through these revived sanskaras he \nrecaptures the experiences through which he has already lived. The period immediately \nfollowing death usually becomes, therefore, an occasion for the repetition of all that has \npreviously been lived through, rather than a period of emancipation through understanding \nall that has been lived out... \nIf death has any value, it is to teach the individual the true art of life. It would be wrong for \nthe aspirant to seek death with the hope of making further progress thereby. On the other \nhand, he should not fear death when it overtakes him. A true aspirant neither seeks death \nnor fears it. And when death comes to him, he converts it into a stepping stone to the higher \nlife. \nSome people are particularly afraid of the exact moment of death because they anticipate \nunbearable pain at that instant. In reality, all physical suffering experienced during illness \nor just before death terminates at the moment of death. The process of the actual dropping \nof the body is quite painless, contrary to the superstition that a person experiences \nindescribable agonies in death. \nHowever, the severing of the individual's emotional entanglement in the Gross world is not \nfound to be easy. The various religious rites observed after a death have primarily the \npurpose of helping the departing individual disentangle himself from these ties. For \ninstance, the repetition of the name of God or of scriptures, often practised after the death of \na person, has a wholesome effect both on those who have been left behind as well as on the \none who has passed away, because they help to free both parties of their mutual sanskaric \nattachment to form. On the other hand, the lamentation and wailing that is often observed \nhas a degrading and depressing effect both on those left behind as well as on the person \nwho has passed away, for it tends to strengthen mutual attachment to form. \nThe thought or wish the dying individual holds at the moment of death has special \nimportance in determining his future destiny. If the last thought is of God or the Master, the \nindividual achieves Liberation. \nIt is quite common for an individual not to have any specific thought at the moment of \ndeath. Even if he has had thoughts or wishes before death, he will tend to forget them at the \ntime of death. At that moment some people hope they may not return to earthly life, but \nthey are not exempted from rebirth by mere wishing. They are reborn, but exhibit a \npronounced disgust for life, and tend to lead the lives of ascetics or recluses. \nIf the good and evil sanskaras* of the individual are almost balanced at the time of death, he \nmay take on a new physical body almost immediately. He may even enter a new incarnation \nas early as the fourth day after death. In such urgent cases of rebirth the individual can \nenliven a ready fetus any time between the sixth and seventh months of embryological \ndevelopment. It is important to note that both father and mother give only prana or vital \nenergy to the fetus. In addition to receiving prana, it must be enlivened by some \nindividualised soul. Ordinarily this takes place during the later stages of embryological \ndevelopment. \nWhen the individual is ready for reincarnation, he is automatically drawn to his future \nparents by sanskaric links. The parents act as a magnet due to their previous connections \nwith the reincarnating individual. Occasionally the strongest sanskaric or karmic link which \nthe reincarnating individual has with incarnate individuals is not with the parents, but with \na brother or sister. It is this link, then, that determines the family in which he takes birth. \nIn times of emergency, as in wars or epidemics, when thousands of individuals may seek \nimmediate reincarnation, it is not always possible for all to be born into families having \nstrong previous links with them. But if the sanskaric status of the individual is precipitating \nhim towards incarnation, his taking on of a body is not postponed merely because parents \nare not available to provide a suitable previous link. It is possible through the intervention \nof the Masters to make infinite adjustments through mutual exchanges. \nDeath is like throwing away clothes which have become useless through wear and tear. Just \nas a traveller may stop at different places, and at each halt may change clothes according to \nhis needs, so the individual goes on changing his bodies according to the needs of his \nsanskaras. \nDeath may also be compared to sleep. When a man goes to sleep, he wakes up in the same \nphysical body. When he drops his physical body at death, he wakes up in another physical \nbody. \n*Good actions leave sanskaric residues in the individual's subconscious as surely as do bad \nactions. Therefore the individual may be bound just as surely by the 'golden chains' forged \nby good actions as by the 'iron chains' of bad actions. \nFor most persons the period between death and birth is one of absorption in subjectivity. As \nmentioned before, after death the ego-mind of the individual normally retains its tie with \nthe remnants of the physical body for three or four days. After this period the connection is \ncompletely severed, and the individual then exists entirely in the subjectivity of his mental \nstates. This subjective phase is brought about by the resurrection of all the sanskaras which \nthe ego-mind has brought along with it after death. \nThe sudden transplanting of the ego-mind from one sphere to another does wear out the \nscars of the sanskaras to some extent, but for the greater part they remain intact. If death \nhad resulted in the complete wiping out of all the sanskaric scars on the mind, it would have \nresulted in emancipation of the individual from all limitation. But this does not happen. Not \nonly are the sanskaric imprints retained after death, but they may unroll unhampered in the \nlife after death... \nThe true death of the individual occurs at that moment when he transcends his limited \nindividuality or separative consciousness by being taken up in the truth-consciousness of \nthe unlimited and undivided being of God. The true death of the individual consists in the \ncomplete disappearance  of  the  limiting  ego-mind  that has created the sanskaric veil of \nignorance. True death is a far more difficult process than physical death, but when it occurs \nthrough the grace of the Master, it takes no longer than the twinkling of an eye. This \ndissolution of the ego-mind and the freeing of the soul from the illusion of separative \nlimited individuality are known as Liberation... \nTrue immortality is not the survival of the limited individual in the period following the \ndeath of the physical body. It is true that the ego-mind persists unscathed through death, \nbut the individual cannot and does not thereupon attain to final freedom from birth and \ndeath. Survival should not be confused with deathlessness, which is true immortality. The \nchain of alternating incarnate and discarnate life is only a survival of consciousness plus \nignorance, and ignorance makes true life impossible. \nLife in ignorance is the very negation of existence in Truth. It is so basic a curtailment of \ntrue existence that when judged by the standards of the true existence in eternity, it had \nbest be termed a continuous death. Only in Realisation is consciousness emancipated from \nthe tyranny of this continuous death which nullifies the true life in eternity. And only in \nLiberation can consciousness arrive at that true immortality which lies beyond all \ncurtailment and obscurity. \nbefore 1956, \nLH p97-111 \nLife does not end with death. Survival after death is as true as death after life. \nTo live in order to die, or to die in order to survive, would be a poor proposition indeed. \nThe death that follows life is not a lifelessness, nor is life after death a deathlessness. \nLife is a positive manifestation of the true existence, which negative death cannot \nextinguish. \nTo end the ceaseless succession of lives and deaths, death itself has to be annihilated in life. \nOn annihilating death in life by completely freeing consciousness of all illusion, man \nbecomes God in the naked truth of his own true existence. He remains infinitely conscious \nGod, irrespective of his keeping or dropping the Gross, Subtle and Mental bodies, just as \nman remains man whether he is dressed or undressed. \nc. 1956, LB p17 \nI say with my divine authority to each and all that whosoever takes my name at the time of \nbreathing his last comes to me. So do not forget to remember me in your last moments. \nUnless you start remembering me from now on, it will be difficult to remember me when \nyour end approaches. You should start practising from now on. Even if you take my name \nonly once every day, you will not forget to remember me in your dying moments. \n24 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, \nGM p320 \nThere is one real birth and one real death. You are born once, and you really die only once. \nWhat is the real birth? It is the birth of a drop in the ocean of reality. What is meant by the \nbirth of a drop in the ocean of reality? It is the advent of individuality, born of individuality \nthrough a glimmer of the first most-finite consciousness, which transfixed cognizance of \nlimitation into the unlimited. \nWhat is meant by the real death? It is consciouness getting free of all limitations. Freedom \nfrom all limitations is real death. It is really the death of all limitations. It is Liberation. \nIn between the real birth and the real death, there is no such reality as the so-called births \nand deaths. What happens in the intermediate stage known as births and deaths is that the \nlimitations of consciousness gradually wear off, until consciousness is free of limitations. \nUltimately, consciousness, totally free of limitations, experiences the unlimited reality \neternally. \nReal dying is equal to real living. Therefore, I stress: die for God, and you will live as God. \nYou are first a child, then grow old and drop the body, but you never die and never were \nborn. In the East, Vedantists believe in reincarnation, in innumerable births and deaths until \none attains Godhood. The Muslims believe in one birth only, and one death only; the \nChristians and Zoroastrians the same. All are right. \nBut Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, Zoroaster, all meant what I mean by real birth and real \ndeath. I say you are born once and die once. All the so-called births are only sleeps and \nwakings. \nThe difference between sleep and death is that when you sleep, you awake and find yourself \nin the same body. But after death, you awake in a different body. You never die. Only the \nblessed ones die and become one with God. \n26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina, \nGM p328 \nBaba said of Mrs. Bahejian, a woman who had come to see him: \nShe resembles my aunt. My name was on her lips when she dropped her body. \nMy brother Jamshed, when we were boys, used to quarrel and fight with me. As he grew \nolder, Jamshed began to love me. Later on, in Meherabad, he couldn't sleep because he \nthought all the time about me. When he went to Poona, all of a sudden he had a splitting \nheadache and the heart felt heavy. And just before an attack of apoplexy, he felt very \nblissful. He shouted my name, and then fell in a coma. And during those three hours, his lips \nwere moving with the rhythm 'Baba, Baba, Baba.' Mani was there. Then he died. He came to \nme. \nAll my relatives, my school friends, you haven't any idea how difficult it was for them to \naccept me as the Avatar after quarreling with me, playing marbles with me. \nCharles Purdom: Will you comment on what you mean by 'to come to me? \nBaba: To come to me means Liberation, experiencing me as I am. No more bondage of births \nand deaths. But it does not mean the state of a Perfect Master, of Perfection. That is only to \nbe attained in the Gross body. So if you are not blessed with this state of Perfection, at least \nyou can have Liberation. If you just take my name, just at the moment of dropping your \nbody, you will come to me. Yes, anyone. \nIt's not easy to take my name at the very moment of leaving the body. Then you individually \nexperience bliss, infinite bliss. After Liberation, you continue to experience infinite bliss \neternally. Why? Because it belongs to you eternally. You experience what belonged to you \neternally. Even spiritual ecstasy cannot be compared with divine bliss. Remember this. \n28 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina \nGM p337 and LA p529 \nThe physical body (of the mind) is the means of experiencing the sanskaras, and when this \nphysical body becomes enfeebled after using up the old sanskaras, the body drops (dies). At \nthat time there is the union of new sanskaras with the mind, and one is ready for new \nexperience to use up the sanskaras Subtly or Grossly. For this purpose the mind takes \nanother physical body. In this way old sanskaras are wiped out, and as this experience \noccurs, new sanskaras are produced. According to the new sanskaric makeup, a new body is \nthen taken to experience the sanskaras. As the old sanskaras are spent, the mind loses \nimpressions and the body weakens, to eventually drop off at death. \nHowever, in the process of spending the old sanskaras while alive, the new sanskaras that \nare produced are imprinted in the mind in seed form. By these imprints, the new sanskaric \nmakeup of the mind forces the old physical body to drop, and a new Gross body is thereby \nformed after the Gross sanskaras are somewhat equalised during the experience of Heaven \nor Hell. Thus the mind continues gathering new sanskaras and, accordingly, new bodies \nduring reincarnation. \nThe infinite intelligence in its original form of the soul without sanskaras never changes; it \nremains always formless. But sanskaras change, and accordingly the human bodies change. \nTo spend new sanskaras through the experience of birth and death is for the body and not \nfor the soul; it has no birth or death. Rebirth is due to the sanskaras which form a Subtle \nbody, and according to the change of the Subtle body in Heaven or Hell, the Gross body \nchanges and is joined to the Subtle body when it takes birth in the Gross world. The new \npsychic or sanskaric makeup in the Mental body from the newly accumulated sanskaras \nfrom the previous life changes the Subtle body while in the states of Heaven or Hell, and this \nchange requires that the Subtle body have a new Gross body. \nThe meaning of death in reincarnation is the changing of the old body according to the new \nsanskaras gathered by the mind. The meaning of birth is the taking of a new body according \nto these new sanskaras. The new sanskaras gathered in the present cannot be used up by \nthe present body, as this body is suitable only for using up the new sanskaras of the \nprevious lifetime. The death of the body is in accordance with the requirements of the new \nsanskaras. Death is necessary because the new sanskaras cannot be spent by the present \nbody, as that human body was formed for spending the then new (now old) sanskaras of the \nprevious body. \nPhysical death and the daily sleep that human beings experience are the same states (of \nmind). No thoughts are active in deep sleep - one does not think, but one awakens in order \nfor the mind to experience thoughts. When awakening, the mind first experiences the \nMental world (ordinary man is unconscious of this), then the Subtle body experiences the \nSubtle world (ordinary man is unconscious of this also). When an ordinary man is \ncompletely awake (conscious), he experiences the Gross world through his physical body. A \nMental conscious person awakens in the Mental plane, as a Subtle conscious person \nawakens in the Subtle plane. Once this involved consciousness becomes active, then, \nautomatically, the Gross body, like a shadow, becomes active. \nEvery time the mind is in sound sleep, its experience of the Mental, Subtle and Gross worlds \ncomes to a stop, but this stop is temporary. When the person awakens, again mind becomes \nactive (thinks). The mind experiences the world Mentally, Subtly or Grossly through the \nMental, Subtle or Gross bodies, and it is the sanskaras that awaken the person. \nEvery time the mind is in the dream state (semi-consciousness) the Gross conscious man \nexperiences his sanskaras Sub-Subtly, and for the time being Gross experience is at a \nstandstill. Every time the mind is in the state of sleep, meaning when the mind stops \nthinking and is inactive, the sanskaras remain in a dormant state to be experienced again in \nthe awake state (action). And every time there is a death, the mind goes to sleep (the \nthinking stops) and the sanskaras are temporarily left behind, since the experiencing of the \nsanskaras awakens the mind, makes it conscious, and forces it to begin thinking again. \nAfter death the mind does not immediately awaken in a Gross body, but in its Subtle body, \nand the individual experiences Gross sanskaras through his Subtle body. This heaven or hell \nexperience is according to the newly gathered sanskaras. While in the states of heaven and \nhell, the mind is awake, and during the experience the good and bad sanskaras balance to \nsome extent in the mind. After this heaven or hell Subtle experience, the mind adopts \nanother Gross body according to the new structure of the Subtle body, and this new \nstructure of the Subtle body is determined by the balancing of the good and bad sanskaras \nthat were left behind in the mind when the person died. \nThe similarity between sleep and death is that in both cases the sanskaras first awaken the \nmind in the Subtle body (to either experience a dream, or heaven or hell). In the Sub-Subtle \nstate while dreaming, the nature of the opposites is still there (because of good and bad \nsanskaras), and through a person's good or bad sanskaras he has the Astral experience of a \nsweet dream or a nightmare. In both sleep and death states the mind stops thinking \ntemporarily, and sanskaras then wake up the mind to experience them Subtly. In the sleep \nstate the sanskaras wake up the mind to the Subtle body, and after the experience of dream, \nto the Gross body to experience the Gross world. But in the case of death, sanskaras wake \nup the mind in a new physical body to experience the sanskaras Grossly as the old body has \nbeen given up. \n1968?

The disciples saw nothing, and \nstood beside him in silence, not knowing what he was doing. One day, at the lane in the back \nof his parents' house, the Master stopped, and started gazing intently at the ground. \n\"After a few minutes, he stood erect and asked, 'Do any of you know what I am doing?' No \none answered. 'Every minute, bodies are dying and coming back again. Every second this \nprocess is occurring. I was watching and directing it all.\"' \nBhau  Kalchuri, \n(April? 1922) \nLM2 p360 \nDiscussing the death of Lewis Charles Nelhams, one of the Mandali, Baba explained, \n\"By dying, Nelhams has done away with his Gross body, but his mind is still living, and very \nsoon this mind will take another suitable Gross medium and again come into contact with \nme. \n\"Those souls who are Liberated have their egoistic minds annihilated, while those who take \nbirth again retain their minds, and those souls who after Liberation return to normal \nconsciousness have universal minds.\" \n27? July 1925, \nMeherabad, \nGM p54 \nWhen Mehendarge received news that his brother had died, Baba took him aside and told \nhim: \n'This life, body and death are all maya, and to weep over the death of someone is ignorance. \nRemember, maya does not mean this world and its affairs. The illusion that this world and \neverything in it is real - and of feeling happy or unhappy over certain conditions - is maya. \n\"See how maya charms and deceives humans and how it entwines itself around them. Daily \nthousands die. Recently in America many died due to floods. In the war in Abysinnia so \nmany were killed. The earthquake in Quetta alone killed 30,000 people. But though these \nthousands and thousands perished, you did not feel upset for them - those thousands of \nmen, women and children who were healthy and strong, who were expected to live a long \nlife, and had various hopes, plans and ambitions. Compared to them, your brother was old, \nunfit and suffering much. And for him, your tears are useless. He is free from his suffering. \nYou should be glad.\"' \n21 March 1936, \nMysore, \nLM6 p1991-1992 \nBaba (to Ragho Patel of Saoner): Would you offer your neck to me? Would you sacrifice your \nlife for me? \nRagho Patel (to Pophali of Saoner): Pophali, you have brought me here for darshan, and \nBaba wants my throat! What will happen to my wife and children? (laughter) \nBaba (smiling): Are you afraid of death? \nRagho Patel: What if I am? When I have a wife and children to look after... \nBaba: To die is not easy. Thousands and thousands die daily, but it is not dying. Dying \nshould be such that it is complete death. Then it becomes life eternal. \nRagho Patel: If I offer my neck in your cause, would you keep me alive eternally? \nBaba: When you are worried about your wife and children, how can you offer your neck? \nRagho Patel: Now I am ready, Baba. \nBaba: Quite ready? \nRagho Patel: I offer you my neck. Slash it. I don't care now if you keep me alive or not. \nBaba (laughing): Now you have become very brave. \n15 May 1943, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p2870 \n\"Baba always encouraged us to face the death of our loved ones, not with undiluted sadness, \nbut with an alloy - a mixture of happiness and sadness. Sadness for our loss, but happiness \nfor their gain.\" \nKitty Davy, LA p312 \nHarjiwan Lal's wife died March 6, 1954. Their daughter cabled Baba: \n'Mother died today. Marriage also today. Whether marriage should take place.' \nHer mother had died that morning, and her daughter's marriage ceremony had been set for \nthat evening. \nBaba cabled back: \n'Marriage should take place. My blessings. Baba' \nGG6 p5-6 \n\"Harjiwan wrote a very heart-rending letter to Baba. In it he expressed his concern that \nperhaps he had failed in his duty to provide the best medical treatment for his very dear \nwife, a soul that had lovingly surrendered to Baba. He was often tormented by remorse at \nthe thought that she had died a 'premature death' because of his negligence... \n\"Baba... in answer dictated several points to Kishan Singh to be conveyed in a letter. In his \nconsoling reply, Baba... assured Harjiwan that there was no such thing as 'premature death.' \nNo amount of medical assistance or neglect could alter the divinely ordained moment of \none's coming to Baba. Harjiwan's wife was destined to come to Baba on that day, so there \nwas no need for Harjiwan to worry. Rather, he should feel happy at her return to him -- the \neternal life.\" \nBal Natu, GG6 p6-7 \n\"In the book 'Listen, Humanity' Meher Baba enumerated the different types of death. Later \nhe said that there was one more type of death that had not been included in 'Listen, \nHumanity' - this he called circumstantial death. \n\"There is only one case of circumstantial death among the Perfect Masters, and that is with \nDnyaneshwar. \n\"Dnyaneshwar was very beautiful physically. His personality was also dynamic and \ncaptivating. His presence was such that everyone flocked to him. They could not be \npersuaded to leave him, even though Dnyaneshwar would take great care to tell those \npeople who had a connection, a link, with other Masters, to go to them and not stay with \nhim. \n\"As Baba explained, in spirituality, the most important point is the link that one has with the \nMaster. You may go to any Master, and, of course, you will derive benefit from the contact, \nbut if you have no connection with that Master, you will eventually have to go to the one \nwith whom you do have a link. This ensures further progress on the spiritual path. \n\"So Dnyaneshwar would dissuade people from staying with him when this was a barrier to \ntheir spiritual progress. But his beauty, his language, and the expression of his personality \nwere such that they persisted in staying with him. Eventually, so his personality would no \nlonger be a hindrance in the spiritual development of some people, he asked that he be \nsealed alive in a small crypt. That is the one case of circumstantial death among Perfect \nMasters. \n\"It is said that many years later, a certain person had a persistent dream of Dnyaneshwar \ntelling him to open the crypt. The dream or vision continued to occur, and so, in time, the \nelders of the time decided to open the crypt. Dnyaneshwar was still there inside, but a root \nof a nearby tree had entwined itself around his neck and was choking him. It was cut off. It \nis also said that Dnyaneshwar said that the crypt was not to be opened again. \n\"But then we might ask, do not all Perfect Masters have appealing personalities? Why \nshould one have more appeal than another? It seems from the story of Dnyaneshwar, that \nsome do. \n\"The answer is that our Gross eyes see the surface, but not that which is inward. So some \npersonalities are more appealing than others, even though all are one in consciousness.\" \nEruch Jessawala, \nbefore 1985, IT p44-45 \nEruch Jessawala was asked about this statement by Meher Baba: \n\"4. Downwards: Those who have acquired extremely bad sanskaras, resulting from deeds \nlike murder for lust or greed, after death go downwards into the region of animal spirits, to \nawait a suitable Gross form for earth life.\" \nEruch wrote: \"Going downwards into the region of the animal spirits does not mean that it \nis a case of retrograde consciousness, or the soul's having a particular type of negative \nsanskaras. Just as the consciousness of some of the good spirits (disembodied souls) is said \nto hover in the place inhabited by human beings, so also the consciousness of the souls \nmentioned in the passage you cited from 'Avatar,' 'go downwards into the region of animal \nspirits...' \n\"This does not mean that they become animals! The word 'downwards' is used to indicate a \nstate of experience of the consciousness of a disembodied human spirit more accentuated \nthan the experience in hell. (All souls under the process of gaining consciousness, or those \nwho have not yet realised Reality are indeed spirits. These spirits, when they realise the \nOver Soul (Reality) are truly the Soul.) Again, the words 'animal spirits' might have been \nused by Beloved Baba to differentiate them from an environment of disembodied human-\nconscious spirits.\" \nEruch Jessawala, \nLF2 p17 \nAbout the quote dated 5 November 1952 in the chapter DEATH: \nPartition was the division of the Indian subcontinent into India and Pakistan in 1948, which \ncaused much violence and death. \nAbout Gustadji, Bal Natu wrote: \"Gustadji was in the habit of wearing a tattered old coat \nwith patches. He was always reluctant to change his clothes. After this teasing, Baba told us \nthat when Gustadji was with him in the West a few months back, he had been a well-dressed \nperson, although he retained his other unusual characteristics.\" \nFor more about death, see Di (7th ed.) p301-306 and LH p93-115. \nFor more about heaven and hell, see Di (7th ed.) p307-312. \nDeath Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "DESTINY \nMeher Baba \nDestiny is the divine law of will which guides one and all from the starting point of evolution \nto the ultimate goal, God-realisation. \nLA p4 \nThere is a course of experience through which every being must pass to realise God... \nIn fact, there is nothing such as happiness and misery, virtue and vice, or good and bad. Only \nbliss exists. The experiences of happiness, misery, virtue, vice, good and bad are nothing. \nBut they are the necessary stepping-stones on the course to higher things, which, though \nillusory, everyone has to pass through. \nOnly the Sadguru can alter, divert or destroy this course. That is, he can change the course \nof a person's destiny. This automatically occurs once a person comes in contact with such a \nMaster. Unless all the experiences and sanskaras of this course are wiped out totally, there \nis no chance of Realisation for the disciple; and only a Perfect Master can do that. \n21 August 1929, \nDhulia, \nLM4 p1203 \nLaw is good. This universe is based on the divine law of love, which pervades all existence. \nbefore 1936, \nPM p251 \nQ. What is destiny, luck, fate, etc.? \nBaba: Destiny means the divine will guiding the lines of sin and virtue, resultant in suffering \nand happiness, experienced by the soul from the beginning of its evolution till its end in \nRealisation. Fate or luck is the means or process of spending the impressions the soul \ngathers while passing through innumerable evolutionary stages, which, in other words, is \nthe law of karma, or the automatic forming of luck or fate in the next life, according to the \nsanskaras in this life. The impressions of each life build the fate of the life coming after. \nAs a simile, suppose every soul has to bear a burden of 700 tons, i.e. a certain amount of \nsuffering and happiness, which every soul has to pass through from the beginning of its \nevolution till the end in Realisation. But as the burden of these 700 tons varies in kind and \nform, the impressions of lives vary too, and the fate of every new life is formed according to \nthe impressions gathered in the past life. \nThus the soul's present experiencing of the impressions of the past life means fate. The soul \nhas to pass through a number of lives and forms, but as the experiences of every life vary, so \nthe fate varies. Hence, destiny is one, but fate or luck is different. \n4 May 1937, \nNasik, \nAw 10:2 p23 \nOther versions: \nAw 2:1 p12 and LA p189-190 \nGod is not kind, he is the ocean of mercy. But it is all according to law. And law is not \ncomplicated, it is simple. You sow a seed, you water it, you have a plant that grows - it is so \nsimple. Law gives you all this from one seed, because all this was latent in the seed. \nLaw deals individually, and also in multitudes of the same type. Your taking birth at a \ncertain time, your giving up the body at a certain time, is all according to law, which shapes \nyour actions. You are not responsible. \nBut what about those who all die at one and the same moment, like thousands in an \nearthquake? Law gathers all of the similar types in one country, and ends it in one time. \nWhen the plant grows into a big tree, it is not conscious of it, not responsible, but law \nshapes it, brings out of it what is there. When you were a baby, you were not conscious how \nyou grew up. It is so natural because law does it. From childhood to old age, you feel the \nsame yourself.  Only when you look in the mirror, you know it (that you are old), and most \nof the time you forget you have got old. \nThis law so establishes itself that there is no escape. It grows into a habit which can never \nbe shaken off. Law asserts itself as soon as you are born. The puppy does not open its eyes \nwhen it is born. It feels hungry and searches for its mother's milk. \nLaw's grip is eternal till you go beyond law. Then you are free. Shams says, \nYou think binding to a Master is binding, and all life is free to do what you like. But you are \nbound by hunger, sleep, etc., and have the body-binding, the greatest binding. But this one \nbinding of faith and love to the Master is sure to free you from all  universal bindings. \nBeing good is a good binding. You must either be good or bad. Bad is like bound wrists. \nGood is like bound feet. Kabir writes beautifully about this: \"Good keeps your hands free, so \nthat you can even unbind your feet.\" \nBe good. It pays. Bad makes you mad (insane). Good takes you to God. And the best way to \nbecome good is to serve others and try to make others happy. The climax of good is loving. \nBad is anger, getting excited. Good is forgiving. Biting is bad, but to be bit is good. If you \noffer your cheek, knowing you could easily wring their neck, that is excellent. \n26 January 1939, \nAgra, India, \nGl Feb. 1994, p6-7 \nShams = Shams Tabriz (d. c.1246) a Perfect Master of Persia \nThe growth of the physical body is worked out by the operation of natural laws. Whereas \nthe progress of the aspirant towards self-knowledge is worked out by the operation of the \nspiritual laws pertaining to the transformation and emancipation of consciousness. \nThe physical body of the child grows very gradually, and almost imperceptibly. And the \nsame is true of the spiritual progress of the person who has once entered the Path. The child \ndoes not know how its physical body grows. The aspirant also is, in the same way, often \noblivious of the law according to which he makes headway towards the destination of his \nspiritual progress. \nc.1940, Di v2 p37 \nBefore karma is created, the individual has a sort of freedom to choose what it shall be. But \nafter it has been accomplished, it becomes a factor which cannot be ignored, and which has \neither to be expended through the results which it invites, or counteracted by fresh and \nappropriate karma. \nThe pleasure and the pain experienced in the life on earth, the success or failure which \nattend it, the attainments and obstacles with which it is strewed, the friends and foes which \nmake their appearance in it, are all determined by the karma of past lives. \nKarmic determination is popularly designated as fate. Fate, however, is not some foreign \nand oppressive principle. Fate is man's own creation pursuing him from past lives. And just \nas it has been shaped by past karma, it can also be modified, remoulded, and even undone \nthrough karma in the present life. \nIf the nature of the karma in earthly life is determined by the impressions stored in the ego-\nmind, the impressions stored in the ego-mind are, in their turn, determined by the nature of \nkarma in earthly life. The impressions in the ego-mind and the nature of karma are \ninterdependent. The karma on earth plays an important part in shaping and reshaping the \nimpressions in the ego-mind and giving it a momentum which decides the future destiny of \nthe individual. \nIt is in the arena of earthly existence that creative and effective karma can take place, \nthrough the medium of the Gross body. The proper understanding and use of the law of \nkarma enables man to become a master of his own destiny through intelligent and wise \naction. \nEach person has become what he is through his own accumulated actions. And it is through \nhis own actions that he can mould himself according to the pattern of his heart, or finally \nemancipate himself from the reign of karmic determination which governs him through life \nand death. \nc.1941? Di v4 p89-90 \nGood actions lead to good results, and bad actions lead to bad results. \nIt is through the systematic connection between cause and effect in the world of values that \nthe moral order of the universe is sustained. If the law of karma were to be subject to any \nrelaxation, reversals or exceptions, and if it were not strictly applicable in the domain of \nvalues, there would be no moral order in the universe. And if there is no moral order in the \nuniverse, human existence would be precarious from the point of view of the attainment of \nvalues. \nIn the universe where there is no moral order, human endeavor would be perpetually \nfraught with doubt and uncertainty. There cannot be any serious pursuit of values if there is \nno assured connection between means and ends, and if the law of karma can be set aside. \nThe inflexibility of the law of karma is a condition of significant action. Significant human \naction would be utterly impossible if the law of karma could be safely ignored or flouted. \nIn being inviolable, the law of karma is like the other laws of nature. However, the \nrigorousness of the operation of karmic laws does not come to the soul as the \noppressiveness of some external and blind power, but as something which is involved in the \nrationality of the scheme of life. Karmic determination is the condition of true \nresponsibility. It means that man will reap as he sows. What a person gathers by way of his \nexperience is invariably connected with what he does. \nIf a person has done an evil turn to someone, he must receive the penalty for it, and \nwelcome the evil rebounding upon himself. And if he has done a good turn to someone, he \nmust also receive the reward for it, and enjoy the good rebounding upon himself. What he \ndoes for another he has also done for himself, although it may take time for him to realise \nthat this is exactly so. The law of karma might be said to be an expression of justice, or a \nreflection of the unity of life in the world of duality. \n1941? \nIndia, \nDi v4 p91-92 \nGod has ordained certain laws for the universe. They are followed by the Sun, Moon and \nstars, and everything that breathes. These laws are not binding for the God-realised ones. \nBut they nevertheless respect and observe these God-ordained laws, because they have \nbecome one with God. \nIn a sense, there is no such thing as a violation of any laws. The so-called miracles are \nperformed using the hitherto unknown powers and forces, which operate according to their \nown laws. The Masters do often perform miracles, but they do so strictly for spiritual \npurposes. And while doing so, they do not throw off the spiritual laws of the universe. They \nare above all laws. But even their super-ordinary achievements are according to the eternal \nlaw of Truth. \nThe whole universe with all its laws is subject to the supreme law of Truth. It is ever being \nadministered impersonally, as well as through the spiritual hierarchy. To the superficial \nobserver, it may seem that there is no reign of Truth in the universe. The Truth does reign, \nand reigns unceasingly and unfailingly. \nEven the insignificant business concerns and other private and public institutions have their \nlaws, and cannot function without laws. Much more so is it true of the universe. This vast \nuniverse, with all the multitudinous occurrences within it, is subject to some self-justifying \nlaw. Sometimes it does appear as if sincere toil is lost, or the virtuous are condemned to \nsuffering and the vicious are enthroned with power or endowed with success. But all this is \neither a fractional view of the realities or an illusion in the garb of judgment. \nTo one who can take a complete and unclouded view of occurrences, the inexorable reign of \nTruth in all happenings, great or small, individual or collective, is a clear and \nunchallengeable fact. The reign of Truth may be described in different ways as the law of \nGod, or the law of justice, or the law of karma. It is the law of cause and effect, or the law of \ndivine love, according to the angle of vision or the limiting perspective given by the \nparticular standpoint of the intellect. \nBut the important fact is that whatever may be the manner in which this law of Truth is \napprehended by the intellect, it unchallengeably exists. It is a supreme and self-justifying \npower that unfailingly and irresistibly reigns in the universe, and it has no exceptions. All \nseers have announced the reign of this law of Truth. It operates both impersonally, and \nthrough the conscious working of the divine hierarchy of Masters and their Agents. \nThough dwelling in the universal mind, with its seat as the universal body, the Truth-\nrealised Masters do not neglect the coordinative and organised working required for the \nexecution of the divine plan. Their plans for the world are made far in advance of the times, \nsometimes centuries before the time when they are intended to be executed. They dwell in \neternity, and they have in their view the past, the present and the future. They are the \ncustodians of God's process of self-fulfillment, working itself out through the march of the \nvariegated incidents in time. \nThe cooperative and organised working of the Perfect Masters expresses itself through the \nfunctioning of the spiritual hierarchy. The Masters, as one with the supreme Godhead, \nconvey the divine will and impulse to the advanced souls or Mahayogis or Pirs of the Mental \nworld. The advanced souls catch the impulse originating in the shoreless Truth, and pass it \non from the Mental world to those who control the Subtle world. In the Gross world it may \nmanifest itself through many natural upheavals, e.g. earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, \nfloods, changes in the  structure of the earth and of the ocean-bed. It may also manifest itself \nthrough the upheavals in the life of mankind (e.g. the rise and downfall of empires, wars, \nepidemics, births, deaths, catastrophes, and other major episodes in the history of \nhumanity). All happenings in the history of humanity are subject to the divine plan, as \nreleased and implemented by the Perfect Masters through their Agents in the different \nworlds. \nThe causes of what becomes patently manifest in the Gross world are to be found in the \ncommotion in the Subtle world. And the causes of the commotion in the Subtle world are to \nbe found in the directives that obtain from the Mental world. And the origin of the directives \nof the Mental world is seen as being none other than the will of God as released by the \nMasters who are consciously one with God. \nThus the Masters are indirectly in charge of the execution of the divine plan. They make use \nof the infinite power and understanding to further that plan in all the three worlds. And \ntheir working gets particularly accelerated and coordinated during the Avataric periods, \nwhen the Avatar, as the inspiring force of the divine hierarchy, assumes the principal \ndirective role in the divine task of giving a spiritual push to humanity. \nbefore August 1949, \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, ST p57-60 \nLaw equally binds all, except those who become free. One principal binding appears in \nvaried aspects, like the uniformity of two hands, one head, and two eyes, running through \nthe differences of human features and figures. According to law, the number of lives and \ndeaths, with their measure of suffering and happiness, is fixed. Until the total number of \nincarnations are gone through, and the amount of experience is earned and unlearned, no \nfreedom can be attained.* But all this experiencing is nothing. When I say this, you will \ngrouse. Since you do not know the law of nothingness, you may even think that there is \nnothing like justice in the world. But that is not so. \nWhen one escapes law and merges in God, who is beyond law, one becomes God. There is no \nbinding. He is Majzoob-e-kamil. He is merged in God, has no normal consciousness, and is \ncompletely disconnected from the world. If he comes down, he brings God on earth. Law \nexists on earth. However, he brings law-exceeded God down as law-abiding God. As \nJivanmukta, God in the Beyond state is conscious of his infinite attributes. Law cannot touch \nhim, because law-exceeded God is infinite, mighty and powerful. The Jivanmukta is God-\nrealised and has normal consciousness, but has no concern with the world, and is \nunaffected by the world. His state is unique. He does everything and yet does nothing. He is \nMajzoob-e-kamil, and also has normal consciousness. \nThe Sadguru (Qutub) is law-exceeded God. He is all-powerful. He comes down from the \nBeyond state to normal consciousness. He is concerned with the world and its people, and \nyet is completely detached from them. He has to work with the sins and merits of the world, \nand is concerned with everyone and everything. He extends his hand of love and grace \nunder a glove that keeps him unaffected by the world. Law cannot touch him, but he touches \nlaw. He acts like an ordinary human being, but uses his infinite power, knowledge and bliss \nto make others free from the law of opposites. \nfrom notes taken of a talk by Meher Baba, \nJuly 1953, Dehra Dun, GG4 p91-92 \nAnother version: GT p267-268 \n*Bal Natu wrote, \"The only exception Baba referred to is through the \ncontact and grace of a Perfect Master or the God-man.\" \n(GG4 p92) \nOnly when God is perfectly individualised, as most Perfect Dnyani or most Perfect A'riff, can \nhe impart Knowledge to other individuals. The question may yet be asked as to why should \nthe Master then not impart Knowledge to all individuals, instead of giving Knowledge to \nsome, and not giving it to others. \nThis is a question of law divine, commonly known as the law of karma, or law of bindings, or \nlaw of cause and effect. Except the Perfect Dnyani or Perfect A'riff, no other individual can \nunder any circumstances escape this law and its consequences. \nTherefore when the Master gives Knowledge to certain individuals and does not give it to \nall, that is not because of the Master's incapacity to give to all, but because of the incapacity \nof one and all to receive Knowledge. The latter incapacity is due to the lack of a sufficiently \ndeep and strong connection with the Master, or for want of complete surrender to his will, \nor on account of the absence of the required degree of preparedness on the part of the \nindividuals concerned. Under these circumstances it would be like throwing pearls before \nswine for the Master to offer Knowledge to one and all irrespective of the individual's \nreceptivity. \nWe are all, in a way, hypocrites, inasmuch as we always try to justify ourselves, right or \nwrong. According to the Vedantists and the Sufis, God does everything. Everything is done \naccording to his will and in accordance with his laws. In a way, that is all right.  But, being \nshort of the truth, the whole of it is not right. And the lack of truth is the lack of experience \nbehind the assertions. \nWithout having gained the actual experience, to act according to facts of experience is not \nonly silly -- like a tutored parrot expressing love to a girl - but such assertions, based on \nmere reasoning and logic, lead to lust and dust. The reactions of the actions based on such \n'ignorance of knowledge' are too terrible to contemplate, apart from other consequences \nlike lunacy or nervous breakdown. \n1950s? Aw 10:4 p 3-5, \nalso PL p35-36 \nAlthough the whole universe is illusion, yet it is governed by a law, a definite law, and that \nlaw deals with every detail. We cannot escape from the law of karma. But when we \ntranscend illusion, the law does not bind us any longer... \nKrishna said the same thing to Arjuna: 'Kill your relatives, kill your friends,' in the battle of \nKurukshetra. You must have heard about that famous battle. \nArjuna refused, saying, 'How can I kill my own kith and kin?' \nKrishna then said, 'I am above the law. The whole creation is from me, has come out of me. \nObey me, and you will not be bound.' \nIf here and now I tell you, there is an ant, and suddenly Don kills it, of course, a binding is \nthen created - the impression of the act of killing. You cannot be free from that binding. You \nare bound because you killed one ant. \nEvery action that you do binds you, every action, every little action, whether good or bad. \nThe good action also binds you, but you are bound then, let us say, by a chain of gold. And if \nthe actions are bad, then you are bound, say, by a chain of steel. \nChrist said, 'Leave all, and follow me.' What did that mean? \nDon Stevens: I assume it means literally to leave everything and follow Christ within \nyourself. \nBaba: But the meaning behind it was not to leave all these things, not to renounce the world. \nIt was to obey. \nLeave all thoughts, your own thoughts, your selfish thoughts, and simply obey me. Then you \nare Liberated, then you are free. But if you cannot, then more and more bindings are \ncreated, for every action creates a binding. \nYou are very old, Don, ages old. And you are bound. And you will be bound, and you'll go on \ngetting bound age after age. Age after age the same bindings will be created, you'll try to \nfree yourself, and in so doing, get rebound. \nBut once you are Liberated completely, then you'll realise that there was no binding at all. It \nwas just imagination, a dream... you were seeing and experiencing only a dream. \nAll of you here are very old - ancient ones. All are God. God is within each one, and God is \nnot bound by time - he is eternal. You are all eternal. Now you are bound. You feel you are \nbound, and you continue to get bound. But there will be a time when every individual gets \nfreed, gets Liberated. Then that individual realises that all his bindings were just in a dream \n- he was seeing a dream. \nChrist took upon himself the sufferings. Why? To Liberate humanity. And the bindings are \nstill there. Mankind is still bound. Yet Liberation doesn't require time. You are bound for \nages, but when you get Liberated, it is instantaneous - it comes in a flash. \nJust think of it: God is within all, in everyone, and he is infinite. God is all powerful, God is all \nbliss. And yet, though God is in each one, how helpless we feel. We weep, we feel pain, we \nfeel sorrow, although God, who is so infinitely powerful and blissful, is there. Why? It is \nbecause of our own bindings. But there is one way to get Liberated from these bindings, and \nthat is through love... \n26 July 1956, \nMyrtle Beach, \nAw 4:3 p38-39 \nThe mystery of the universe is hierarchic in structure. There are graded orders, one \nsupervening upon the other. The spiritual panorama of the universe reveals itself as a \ngradient with laws upon laws. Superimposition of one type of law over the other implies \nelasticity and resilience of lower laws for the working out of higher superseding laws. \nInstead of lawlessness, it means a regime of graded laws adjusted with each other in such a \nmanner that they all subserve the supreme purpose of God, the creator. \nThe lower laws are  subsumed under the higher laws. We have first the law of cause and \neffect reigning supreme in nature. Such natural laws seem to be mechanical, rigid and \ninexorable. But by acting and interacting with life-force, they lead to higher laws of \nsanskaric or impressional determination, and become superseded by them. Impressional \ndeterminism is not an exception to causal laws, but is their finer and higher form. It \nsupervenes upon mechanical causal laws. \nLet us take an example to illustrate the functioning of supervening orders in the spiritual \npanorama. The days of every incarnate soul in the Gross world, and what they bring, are \nboth definitely determined by the accumulated impressions of past lives. But this \nimpressional determinism does not work itself out independently of, or in defiance of, \nordinary causal laws. On the contrary, it works through established causal laws. \nFor example, wrong diet or gluttony or any other disregard for natural physiological laws \nwill definitely affect the duration of the life-term in the Gross body. In the same way, \nintelligent use of known laws will affect happenings during this term of life. But whether or \nnot there is going to be a disregard of such laws on the part of some particular soul, is itself \nimpressionally determined, i.e. it is dependent upon his gathered dispositions. Thus \nphysiological and other causal laws are subsumed by higher karmic laws, and lend \nthemselves as pliant fabric-work for them. The law of karma supersedes and uses the other \nlaws of nature without violating them. \nNor are the natural laws in any way violated by what are called miracles. No miracle is an \nexception to the existing laws of the universe. It is an overt result of the impersonal working \nor conscious use of the established laws of the inner spheres. It is called a miracle because it \ncannot be explained by the known laws of the Gross world. Here known laws are \nsuperimposed by unknown laws. It is not a case of chaos or lawlessness. \n1957? Be p33-35 \nEverything happens according to divine will, and it is a mistake to think that God has a rival \nin the form of a devil. \n1956? Be p57 \nWhatever is to happen will happen. This is the principle, or as I call it, the Law of Must, the \nlaw on which universal illusion thrives. It is as if the ready and complete film of illusion, \nfrom the beginningless beginning to the endless end, is being projected continually. \n8 September 1957, \nMeherazad, \nLC p82 \nWe start with the birth of a child, one human child, for example. The birth of this human \nchild is due to his past karma. No sooner has he taken birth than he begins to experience the \nsanskaras acquired out of his past lives. So what will be the nature of the child? The nature \nof the child will, of course, be his past sanskaras. That child must act, feel and think \naccording to his sanskaras accumulated in past lives. There is no way out, and he must \nexperience them. That is the Law of Must. \nTo add to this principle of Must, the environmental circumstances are such that they help \nthe child to act, feel and think according to his past sanskaras. No sooner does the child see \nthe light of earth, whether it be male or female, it begins to grow older day by day. It has to \nweep as soon as it is born. It must be given milk-diet. The child must grow bigger and \nbigger. It must have a name. Its sex, etc., are determined by the principle of Must. \nThe child knows not whence he or she has come from. It has no thought of all that. It takes \nfor granted that it is born, and it begins to live. It gets a sex and a name, cries, eats, drinks, \nlater studies in school, and enjoys life - all this because of his or her nature... \nIt is your very nature that makes you think that you are a man or woman, that you have a \nbody (sickly or healthy, beautiful or ugly, etc.) It makes you think that you are hungry, \nrobust, unwell, etc. \n23 February 1958, \nMeherabad, \nAw 7:2 p24 \nIt is in God's plan to awaken everyone from the dream of creation, and make him live in him \nand experience his infinite bliss. The law of opposites operates unfailingly to stage the so-\ncalled good and bad times. And in his compassion, God leads everyone and everything \ntowards himself, who is beyond good and bad. So there is really nothing to worry over. \n1960, \nPoona, \nDH p66 \nGod's existence is infinite. God's dnyan (knowledge) is infinite. God's power is infinite. God's \nbliss is endless. God's mercy is unbounded. God's mercy is closely linked with sanskaras. \nThe law of illusion governs sanskaras, and illusion is governed by sanskaras. \nThere are no sinners as such. According to the law of illusion, sanskaras give rise to so-\ncalled sins. The law of illusion is different from the divine will. Nothing can supersede the \nlaw of illusion except divine will. \nThe deaths of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi and John Kennedy had been so because of \nthe law of illusion which governs sanskaras, and had nothing to do with divine will. \nAO p172 \nAccording to the law that governs the universe, all suffering is your labour of love to unveil \nyour real self. In comparison to the infinite bliss you experience on attaining the I am God \nstate, all the suffering and agony you go through amounts to practically nothing. \nc.1961, \nIndia, \nEN p48 \nThere is a king who has vast possessions. But he is a worthless king. He spends all his \nenergy and money in selfish pursuits and luxuries, and has no care for his subjects. In his \nnext birth, he is born blind, and becomes a beggar, and thus compensates for his wrong \ndoings. \nNow this king has a servant who is honest and faithful and hard-working. In his next birth, \nbecause of his merits, he is born into  a cultured and well-to-do family. One day when he is \ngoing along the street, he hears a pitiable cry from the pavement. It is from the blind beggar \nwho was the king in his previous life, crying aloud with outstretched hands, 'Have pity, give \nme a penny in the name of the Lord.' And because all actions, however trivial, are inwardly \ndetermined by the sanskaric ties, creating claims and counter-claims, the rich man is \nunconsciously drawn towards the beggar, and gives him a few copper coins. \nA king crying out for alms, and a servant taking pity on him - what a comedy, what an irony \nof fate. This is the working of the law of karma, the expression of justice in the world of \nvalues. \nThe law of karma is impartial and inexorable. It knows no concessions, gives no \npreferences, makes no exceptions. It dispenses justice. \nBy the divine law you are shielded from remembrance of past lives, for it would not help \nyou in living your present life, but would make it infinitely more complicated and confusing. \nc.1961, \nIndia, \nEN p53-54 \nTo you, what you see is absolutely real. To me, it is absolutely false. I alone am real and my \nwill governs the cosmic illusion. It is the truth when I say that the waves do not roll or the \nleaves do not move without my will. \nThe moment the intensity of your faith in my will reaches the apex, you bid adieu to worry \nfor good. Then, all that you suffered and enjoyed in the past, together with all that you may \nexperience in the future, will be to you the most loving and spontaneous expression of my \nwill. And as the lover places the will of the beloved above all else, there is nothing which can \ncause worry. \nc.1961, \nIndia, \nOL (Aw?), \nanother version: EN p62 \nThere are two things, Truth and law. Truth belongs to God, law belongs to illusion. Illusion \nis infinitely vast, yet it is governed by law. The law of cause and effect, which none can \nescape, belongs to this law. \nLaw is bondage. Truth is freedom. \nLaw upholds ignorance. Truth upholds reality. \nLaw governs imagination, which binds you to illusion. \nTruth sets you free from illusion. \nAlthough it is the nature of imagination to run riot, it is restricted to the definite and \nminutely precise pattern of bindings created and upheld by the law of bondage. The \nmoment imagining ceases, the shackles of the law are broken, and freedom is experienced \nin the realisation of the Truth. \nIt is impossible for one, of oneself, to overcome the operation of the law and merge in the \nTruth. Only those who are one with God can take you beyond the bounds of the law, and \ngive you the experience of the freedom which is the Truth. \nc.1961, \nIndia, \nEN p97 \nEverything in the universe is, and from the beginning has been, a materialisation of the \ndivine original whim, working out irrevocably without default, deflection or defeat. It is the \nunfolding upon the screen of consciousness of the film of creation, sequence after sequence, \naccording to the pattern that issued from the original whim. \nHowever, when God as God-man plays the role of audience, he can alter or erase at his \nAvataric whim any thing or happening which was destined from the original whim. But the \nvery arising of the Avataric whim was inherent in the original whim. \nThe Sufis distinguish between qaza, destined occurrences, and qadar, happenings which are \nimpulsive or accidental. The Avatar's or Qutub's actions are impulsive, and arise from their \ninfinite compassion. And the functioning of this whim relieves and gives beauty and charm \nto what would otherwise be a rigid determinism. \nThe Qutub's actions bring about modifications in the previously determined divine plan, but \nthey are limited in extent. But the Avatar's interventions bring about modifications on a \nuniversal scale. \nFor instance, suppose that it was divinely ordained for a war to occur in 1950. It must take \nplace at the appointed time, and the train of events which follows will punctually meet the \npresent timetable. However, if the Avatar is in the world at the time, he might, in his \nexercise of qadar, ward off the catastrophe by some particular action on the Gross plane. \nAnd so, in the relentless working out of the laws of nature, there can enter the inexplicable \ndivine caprice, spelling out peace instead of war in the diary of man. \nKabir has said: \nKabir rekha karam kee kabhee na meete Ram, \nMeetanhar samarth hai para samajh kiya hai kam. \n'O Kabir, the lines of fate are never effaced by Ram. He is all-powerful, and can undo destiny, \nbut he never does so, for he has given full thought to what he has planned.' \nThe Avatar does not, as a rule, interfere with the working out of human destinies. He will do \nso only in times of grave necessity, when he deems it absolutely necessary from his all-\nencompassing point of view. For a single alteration in the planned and imprinted pattern, in \nwhich each line and dot is interdependent, means a shaking up and a re-linking of an \nunending chain of possibilities and events. \nThe least divergence from the pre-drawn line of fate not only requires infinite adjustments \nwithin the immediate orbit of the individual concerned, but involves in its interminable \nrepercussions all those connected by the bond of past sanskaras. \nThe Avataric whim is also part of the divine destiny. Qaza provides for the absolute \nnecessity of the Avatar's chance intervention, and the very unpredictability of this \nintervention is predicted in qaza, for his infinite compassion, because of which his \nintervention occurs, may not be denied. \nIn the working out of the Avataric whim, there is not the least element of chance. The aim of \nthe whim's action is perfect, and its result is precise. An ordinary person's whim, when \nexpressed, may have consequences quite outside itself, as illustrated by the following story: \nA drunken man was passing by a wood-apple tree, and had a whim to taste one of its fruits. \nAs a rule, a drunkard has a distaste for sour or tart things, because they nullify the effect of \ndrink. So this man's wanting a wood-apple was purely a whim, independent of thought or \nreal desire. \nHe picked up a stone and threw it at the tree. The stone missed any of the apples, killed a \nbird, scared away many others, and fell on the head of a traveller resting beneath the tree. \nThus the haphazard expression of the drunkard's whim not only failed to accomplish the \nwhim, but brought about results completely outside it. The whim was merely an unrelated \nfancy, and the action stemming from it had no connection with its object. \nThis sort of thing can never happen in the exercise of the Avatar's whim. Arising from \ncompassion, and the expression of Perfection, it is perfect in its aim and results. \nc.1960, \nIndia, \nEN p106-107 \nKeep happy and cheerful, and never worry about the environment in which you find \nyourself... \nEverything is in its place according to the divine plan, and because of the love of the God-\nman for his creation. \nAw 19:2 p2 \n(individual instruction) \nThere is no free will. Everything is in accordance with the working out of one's own \nsanskaras, and even this depends on the preordained plan set in execution with the \nemergence of the original whim of God, which gave the original urge to know 'Who am I?' It \nis the primal impression that works itself out as one's destiny and as apparent free will. \nThus, in fact, there is no free will. \nWD p29 \nDestiny Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

Separateness implies fear. Fear causes worry. The way of \noneness is the way to happiness. The way of manyness leads to worries. I am the only one \nwithout a second, so I am eternally happy. You are separate from your Self, so you always \nworry. To you, what you see is absolutely real. To me, it is absolutely false. I alone am real \nand my will governs the cosmic illusion. It is the truth when I say that the waves do not roll \nor the leaves do not move without my will. \n\"The moment the intensity of your faith in my will reaches the apex, you bid adieu to worry \nfor good. Then, all that you suffered and enjoyed in the past, together with all that you may \nexperience in the future, will be to you the most loving and spontaneous expression of my \nwill. And as the lover places the will of the beloved above all else, there is nothing which can \ncause worry. \n\"Live more and more in the present, which is ever beautiful, and which really stretches far \nbeyond the limits of the past and the future. If at all you want to worry, let your only worry \nbe how to remember me constantly. This is worth worrying about, because it is the antidote \nfor worry. Think of me more and more, and all your worries will dwindle into nothing, for \nthey really are nothing. And my will works out to awaken this in you and in all.\" \nc.1960, India, OL, \nanother version: EN p62 \n\"The judges of the world bring guilt to the guilty and punish them.

    "text": "DIET \nMeher Baba \nTo eat meat is detrimental to some extent in controlling one's sexual nature. The main \ndisadvantage is that eating meat increases sexual desires. \nConsciousness exists in stones, but there is so very little consciousness in stones, almost \nnothing. It is in vegetation that the evolution of consciousness begins. And consciousness \nincreases as an animal form evolves into another animal form. In man it is complete. \nWith the advance in consciousness, sexuality also increases. The more the consciousness, \nthe more the sexual longing, and the less the consciousness, the less the sexual longing. So if \nwe eat meat, the degree of sexuality increases in us. But if we remain on vegetarian food, \nthen it neither increases nor decreases. \n26 April 1924, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p626 \nAnother version of the same explanation: \nThere are many disadvantages of flesh-eating. The chief one is that it increases passion. \nThere is very little chaitanya* in the stone, so little as to be nil. The manifestation of \nchaitanya has its beginning from vegetable life. It increases in animals, and reaches its \nclimax in the human form. Now, passion increases with chaitanya. The more chaitanya, the \nmore passion, and likewise, the less chaitanya, the less passion. \nTherefore if we take animal food, the element of passion increases in us, while it neither \nincreases nor decreases when we take vegetable food. \nRD p319 and SW p202-203 \n*chaitanya = consciousness, intelligence? \nThe word 'passion' seems to be used here to mean sexual desire, rather than intense \ninterest or excitement. \nStrong tea provides a very good stimulant to tired nerves. But it causes no real \nimprovement in health. On the contrary, the general health is usually undermined with \nstrong stimulants. \n26 November 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p982 \nThere are three things that are good for increasing and purifying the blood: pomegranates, \ngrapes and tomatoes. But grapes have one defect: they create bile. \nOkra is good for people with backaches. \nPotatoes give strength, but create gas. \nLentils are good. \nBeans, pumpkins, cabbages and cauliflower are not nourishing, but are tasty. \nEggplant is the worst possible thing for you. To eat eggplant is to commit suicide, because it \nspoils the blood and turns it into water. \nRadishes create gas, but they are good for the intestines. \nSpinach is also very good... \nWe are not talking of sanskaras, but of the quality of things. Among non-vegetarian food, \nfish is the best for the brain because it contains phosphorus. \nEggs are good but are hard to digest. \nAmong all foods, milk is the best, because nothing is killed in obtaining it. The next best are \nvegetables, because life in them is not fully developed. The worst impressions lie in non-\nvegetarian food. By eating meat, a person at once contacts animal sanskaras, which \nstimulate anger and lust. \n10 October 1928, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1107 \nAnother version of the same explanation: \nOut of all foods consumed, milk is the best, because there is no loss of life in it. Then comes \nvegetable kingdom, because in it life is not complete. And worst is animal food. By eating \nflesh, we at once catch the sanskaras of the animal, and our anger and lust are provoked. \nGl August 1973, p2 \nI must ask all aspirants to remember once and for all, that if they are desirous of rapid \nprogress and quick enlightenment, they should live up to the following four laws: \n1. If possible, observe celibacy. If already married, keep as little sexual intercourse with \nyour partner as possible. Consider, if you are a man, all other women as your sisters; if you \nare a woman, all other men as your brothers. \n2. Avoid all animal food, except milk and the products of milk. Don't partake of even eggs. \n3. Avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea is not an intoxicant, provided it is weak.  But \nbe moderate in your habit of tea drinking. \n4. Curb yourself, and never give way to anger. Whenever you fly into a passion, you contract \nred sanskaras, which are the worst of all. \nFebruary 1930, Ms 2:2 p8 \nFor years I have been a vegetarian... \nMy Mandali have also been eating only vegetarian food for years now. I would rarely make \nany of them fast on milk. However, once... I kept over twenty of my Mandali fasting on just \nmilk for two or three months, but none of them felt any discomfort. A Parsi named Pleader \nhas been living only on milk for the last two and a half years. He is quite healthy and happy... \nThere is another devotee of mine named Dixit in Kolhapur, at a school there. He has also \nbeen on milk for the last twelve years, although he takes bananas with it. He is quite fit and \nworks all day... \nMilk is the best food. It sustains the body and purifies the mind. And the more the mind \nbecomes pure, the more it can be controlled. Desires become less, which is necessary for \nspiritual aspirants, as there is no progress on the Path without the mind being under \ncontrol. So long as desires and longings persist, the mind cannot be controlled. From that \nstandpoint, therefore, milk is the best food. \n... The Parsis defame me and call me shaitan - devil - simply because I do not eat meat and \nfish. I don't drink liquor, and have never been to a brothel. Their definition of a Parsi is that \nhe should be a non-vegetarian, drink wine, and lead an immoral life, while at the same time \nwearing the religious symbols of the sadra and kusti, visiting the fire temple, and paying \nheed to the priests. Thus by their behavior, they themselves have become devils, in fact. \nto Mahatma Gandhi, \n8 September 1931, \non board the Rajputana \nen route to Marseilles, \nFrance, \nLM4 p1394-1396 \nVegetarian food and milk assist the development of the divine nature in man, whereas eggs, \nmeat, alcoholic drinks and fish tend to excite the animal nature in man. \nSa (1933) p8 \nTea or coffee, though injurious, is not so injurious as tobacco, alcohol, bhang-ganja, and \nother strong intoxicants. Rather these - tea or coffee - are in some cases beneficial, \nparticularly when medically advised and taken in mild form. Excessive use of these, and in \nstronger forms, is as injurious as tobacco, alcohol, etc. \nbefore March1934, \nMG 3:1 p22 \nQ. When did you openly become vegetarian? \nBaba: After Realisation. \n1930s, A p54 \nWhat is the use of a body which resists the dictates of the mind? It is no use clinging to the \ncomforts of the body, which one day must be given up. It is only an instrument, and one \nshould take maximum work from it. \nImpressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines, because \ntherein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more \nsusceptible to lust and anger. \nST p26 \nI have abstained from fish, eggs and meat, not for my benefit, but to create and impress \nupon humanity an example, which, later, when I speak, will become an established law. \n31 October 1937, \nCannes, France, \nLM6 p2232 \nAlso Gl August 1970 p16, and LA p216 \nNo one can eat meat or fish in my ashram. \n1939, Jabalpur, LM7 p2406 \nElderly people should not eat eggplant. \n1939, Bangalore, LM7 p2490 \nFood is a direct necessity of life, and its continued denial is bound to be disastrous to health. \nTherefore, external fasting should be periodical, and only for a short time. \n1938-1939, \nIndia, \nDi v1 p51 \nAbdul Ghani: Flesh-eaters, similar to lions and tigers, are very powerful and energetic \ncreatures. Their stomachs are never bloated. But the grass-eating bullock has a big stomach \nwithout the strength, power and courage of the carnivores. So if the Mandali become non-\nvegetarians, we will be strong like lions. \nBaba: The elephant is also a vegetarian, and just see how strong he is. Why don't you be like \nan elephant instead? \nGhani: But the elephant carries a big stomach. \nBaba: Then let your stomach grow. Your stomach should be as big as your head. Then you \nwill look fine. So take plenty of vegetarian food while you're here. \n10 February 1940, \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2514 \nThe body can make up for its deficiencies by the assimilation of the right sort of food... \nIt is necessary to attend to the balancing of the diet, even when we have satisfied ourselves \nabout the nutritive value of the different components of the diet... \nA faulty diet can upset physical health... \nThe wrong type of food can ruin health instead of nourishing it... \nGood health requires constant elimination of the waste products and poisonous \nsubstances... \nc. 1941, Di v4 p46-47 \nThe body will survive for 95 days if one remains only on water. Just as the body feeds on \nfood, so the mind feeds on desires, and indulgence in these desires feeds the mind and the \nego. So by starving the mind of these desires, the ego becomes very thin and weak. \nIn a physical fast, taking only water, as you did yesterday, lust is lessened, but anger and \nhope are increased. During the first three days of a fast, hunger is marked, depression is \nstrong, anger is strengthened, and lust is diminished. From the third to the seventh day, \nthere is a fluctuation in feelings: hunger, depression, anger and lust are all lessened, while \nhope - for everything - is still strong. \nOn the tenth day, the feelings again swing back, and there is increased hunger and anger. \nThis lasts until the fourteenth day, when the feelings again become calm and remain calm. \nThus, after the fourteenth day, a fast has no spiritual value. \n13 January 1942, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p2757 \nI want 25 men who can, under proper circumstances, fast on water for seven days, from the \n25th to the 31st of July. By proper circumstances, I mean the person should be free of any \nresponsibility. Otherwise, as Ghani would say, 'It would make his wife weep,' and that \nwould hinder my work. In short, I want those who can fast freely and undisturbed. Either \nfast or keep silence. \nEven if you were to fast for 40 years, you would never be able to realise God. Otherwise, \nevery dumbbell in the world would be God-realised. Adi Sr. has remained on water for 28 \ndays. Pilamai of Karachi has lived on water for 31 days, and throughout the time was active \nin performing her household duties. Only when I sent an order from here did she begin \ntaking food. Kitty and a boy Ernest lived on water in London for 40 days, and similarly \nothers. \nBut all this fasting and silence has nothing to do with God or even the Path. The reason for \nthis is, as you will know tomorrow, that good and bad both are binding. Not eating binds \njust as well as eating. In short, fasting and not fasting are both binding. God is beyond both. \nHe is even beyond hope. \nWhy do you fast? With some hope, of course, whether it is material or spiritual. The fact is \nthat the very thought of fasting or beginning a fast is binding. One fasts either because one is \nill or has no appetite. None could be prepared to fast without a motive. Even if you think of \nfasting to death, that thought of fasting itself is a binding. 'I will fast to death to see God.' \nThat thought is always there. But only a very few rare souls can see God by such a threat. It \nis heroic, but very rare. \n15 May 1943, Meherabad, \nto 125 men devotees Baba \nhad invited for a special work, \nLM8 p2872 \nBy walking one stimulates good appetite, and returning on foot after eating is good for the \ndigestion. \nAugust 1948, Ahmednagar, \nto Elizabeth Patterson \nLM9 p3298 \nI allow vegetarians to follow their diet, and non-vegetarians to eat meat, fish, etc. \n1 March 1953, \nRishikesh, \nLC p20 \nIn the morning in  India we have one cup of tea. For lunch we have curry, rice and gravy. In \nthe evening we have four chapatis (Indian bread) and one vegetable. On Friday, I ask them \nto eat only once, and keep a fast the rest of the day... \nMost of the people of the world, all they have is one square meal a day. In India, many don't \neven have that. \nAugust 1956, \nSan Francisco, \nAL p43 \nThe days of every incarnate soul in the Gross world, and what they bring, are both definitely \ndetermined by the accumulated impressions of past lives. But this impressional \ndeterminism does not work itself out independently of, or in defiance of, ordinary causal \nlaws. On the contrary, it works through established causal laws. For example, wrong diet or \ngluttony, or any other disregard for natural physiological laws, will definitely affect the \nduration of the life-term in the Gross body. In the same way, intelligent use of known laws \nwill affect happenings during this term of life. \nBut whether or not there is going to be a disregard of such laws on the part of some \nparticular soul, is itself impressionally determined, i.e. it is dependent upon his gathered \ndispositions. Thus physiological and other causal laws are subsumed by higher karmic laws, \nand lend themselves as pliant fabric-work for them. The law of karma supersedes and uses \nthe other laws of nature without violating them. \n1958?  Beams p34-35 \nBaba: Do you eat meat? Are you a non-vegetarian? \nBal Natu: Baba, mine is a buffer state. Personally, I do not relish meat. I prefer a vegetarian \ndiet. \nBaba (smiling): Some make much about diet. Everything has its merits and demerits. \nc.1960, \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nGG1 p318 \nHere are some who dislike meat, and here are others who like it the most. Dislikes bind as \nmuch as likes. My concern is to free you from both. Love alone frees. But where self is, love \nis not, and where you are not, love is. \nGG1 p319 \nIt's not what goes into your mouth that counts, but what comes out. \n1960s, \nIndia, \nto Ed Luck \n\"Always eat well and dress well.\" \n\"Eat well means not too much, and not too little. Dress well means don't be a dandy, and \ndon't be shabby.\" \n1960s, India, \nto George McCuen \n(Two separate quotes, advice sent to \nGeorge McCuen in letters to Adele Wolkin) \nDiet Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

He remarked to \nthe Mandali, \n'Yesterday I watched all of you eat too much. The rich food should be properly digested, or \nelse you will fall sick.' \nAll cringed at the thought of another march, and Ahmed Khan was anxiously waiting for the \nMaster to signal the order. Instead Baba said, \n'There is only one cure that will help. Today we must all laugh a lot. Heartly laughter will \ndigest the food.' \nAll were delighted at this novel suggestion, and many humorous anecdotes were told. Baba \ntoo shared in the jokes, and made the Mandali laugh.\" \nFebruary 1923, \nManzil-e-Meem, Bombay, \nBhau Kalchuri, LM2 p487 \nBaba visited Chanji's father Hormusji Dadachanji. Hormusji had been diagnosed with cancer \nof the throat, and was unable to eat or even to drink water. He had been a strict vegetarian. \nBaba told him to eat fish. Hormusji was able to eat a small amount of fish, and thereafter he \nwas able to eat. He experienced less pain, but was still very weak. He died peacefully not \nlong after. \nLM4 p1307 (27 or 28? \nApril 1930, Bombay) \nHerbert Davy was going to China to work as a professor of Literature for the League of \nNations. Baba gave him these instructions, among others: \n\"Be a vegetarian. Do not smoke or drink. Meditate for one or two hours daily... Never take \nopium. \n16 September 1931, \nDevonshire, England, \nLM4 p1421 \nMr. Vivian: Any instructions about food? \nBaba: If you can possibly give up eating meat, do that.* But don't let it disrupt your day-to-\nday activities and health. \n29 September 1931, \nLondon, \nLM4 p1440 \n*According to Bhau Kalchuri, Baba told Vivian \nto stop eating meat at Meredith Starr's suggestion. \nThe wife of a composer told Baba, \n\"I was a skeptic, but after meeting you, my illness, which has troubled me for years, has left \nme. I feel mentally perplexed and physically stiff at times. Perhaps it is because I eat meat.\" \nBaba: It is not a question of food, or eating meat. You may eat it. Your heart is pure, and that \nis enough. Do one thing - stop worrying. I shall help you and your husband. \n29 September 1931, \nLondon, \nLM4 p1440 \n\"... Until 1932, Meher Baba did not allow his Mandali to have eggs, so they could not even eat \ncakes or chocolates. Because of that restriction, during Baba's first visit to the West, the \nMandali who accompanied him had to appease their hunger mostly with bread and butter, \nand it was Winter. Nevertheless, Baba gradually granted them permission to have eggs, and \nafter a few years, fish and meat if they so desired.\" \nBal Natu, GG1 p316 \nKitty Davy wrote about a trip of nine women and one man to stay with Meher Baba in India, \nleaving London March 24, 1933, and arriving in  Bombay April 8th: \n\"Baba had sent us definite orders not to sunbathe when on the Red Sea, and about taking \nplenty of iced lemonade, etc. Until leaving London we had been allowed to eat fish. After \nleaving London, no fish allowed. Not one detail was left for us to settle. He thought out \neverything beforehand.\" \nPM p193 \nCharles Purdom wrote about Baba around 1936: \n\"He is a strict vegetarian, takes no alcohol, and does not smoke. \n\"Though his tastes in food are simple, he is often difficult to please. Sometimes in Italy the \nhousekeepers would plan a delicious meal of rice, vegetables cooked with hot spices, lentils, \ngrapes, peaches, green figs, and orange juice. To make happy those who had prepared the \nmeal, he would say it was delicious; but afterwards it would be noticed that he had barely \nnibbled at a few dishes. The only evidence of eating would be a slice of bread with a hole in \nthe centre. He eats, but seems to have no desire for eating.\" \nPM p231 \n\"Do not eat flesh or fish. Eggs, vegetables, milk and fruit should be the diet. Do not take \nintoxicating alcohol or liquor.\" \nMeher Baba, February 1937, individual \ninstruction to Garrett Fort, LM6 p2117 \nA Swiss man fasted three days to prepare himself to meet Meher Baba. Baba told him: \n'You must be hungry. Spirituality is as normal and natural as that chair you are sitting on. \nYou need not fast. Only love is important.\" \nAugust 1937, \nCannes, France, \nLM6 p2205 \nA fourteen year old boy, Suloo Meshram, read about Meher Baba in a newspaper. He wrote \nto Baba, got permission to see him, and traveled by train from  Nagpur to Panchgani, about \n700 miles. Suloo told Baba that he wanted to offer his life to Baba and obey him implicitly. \nHe stayed three days with Baba and the Mandali. \nMeher Baba said of Suloo, \"Fit for this path.\" Baba gave him these instructions: \nHe should never tell a lie to anyone. \nHe should abstain from lustful actions, smoking and alcohol. \nHe should not eat meat, fish or eggs. \nHe was to meditate for an hour every day; and to write 'Om Parabrahma Baba' for another \nhour daily.\" \nGG6 p65-66 and LM7 p2277 (April 1938) \n\"Preparations began for another mast trip. Often pure drinking water was unavailable \nduring these travels. On January 24th, while discussing with Adi Sr. the precautions to be \ntaken during the trip, Baba commented, \n'When thirst is intense and bad water is drunk, it does not affect your health. But when \nthirst is not intense, if bad water is drunk, it will have a detrimental effect.\"' \nBhau Kalchuri, LM8 p2844 \n(24 January 1943, Meherabad) \nIn the 1940s, Norina  Matchabelli lived in  New York. Baba told her to eat no meat, with one \nexception: she could eat turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas. \nNorina told Ivy Duce, who had not yet met Baba, that she felt Baba would also want her to \ngive up meat-eating, except turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas. So for two years Mrs. \nDuce stopped eating meat. She decided to eat fish instead, although she 'loathed fish.' \nWhen Ivy Duce visited Baba in India in January 1948, Norina was also present, and Baba \ntold Norina to tell Mrs. Duce that she could eat meat, but not to eat fish. Ivy Duce later \nwrote, 'I assumed that it was so that I should learn to be indifferent to whether I ate this or \nthat.' \nLater, Baba told her, in reference to teaching Sufism, \n\"Do not stress pork, alcohol or tobacco in the West.

    "text": "DREAMS \nMeher Baba \nIn a way, even an ordinary dream is also a subconscious experience of the Subtle, because \neveryone necessarily makes an actual use of one's Subtle body in the dreaming state. But, be \nit noted, through that body one experiences different sensations and happenings pertaining \nto the Gross only. In other words, the ordinary dreaming state is the experience of the Gross \nthrough the Subtle means in the subconscious state. \nc.1933, \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \nSi p8 \nQ. What are dreams? \nBaba: Dreams are subconscious experiences which are always linked with your Gross \nexperiences of the past. Sometimes in your dreams you see persons you never saw in this \nlife. This link is from the past. It is all based on illusion and imagination. So everything \nexcept the Real Self is based on illusion. \nElizabeth Patterson: How was it that when I was twelve years old, I dreamed of you three \ndifferent times in succession, and when I first met you, years after, I recognised you as the \none I had known in the dreams. Was that an illusion? \nBaba: What I mean is that everything except your being infinite is illusion. I am very ancient, \nvery very old, and always young. \nDecember 1936, \nNasik, \nLA p158 \nI will one day explain all about dreams. There are seven kinds. Some are due to indigestion. \nThe sixth has no meaning. The seventh has significance. \nDecember 1936, \nNasik, \nAw 10:2 p10, \nalso LA p158 \nSubconscious experiences, although of the same plane, vary. Some are mere dreams, some \nvisions, some the foretelling of the spending of impressions. But even the subconscious can \nbe hallucinated. Now what is hallucination? This is very interesting. It is not a dream, it is \nlike delusion, but the difference can be understood by examples. You sit relaxed, and in your \nmind, pictures of your home, your mother, etc., come to mind. And you speak to the pictures \nthat you can bring before your mind. This is imagination. \nYou imagine yourself being in America. Now, in your imagination, you think that you can \nactually see your home, your mother, etc., and feel their presence. This is hallucination. As \nanother example, I asked one man to fast for forty days on water only. On the fortieth day he \nsaw figures with ten heads, twelve hands, speaking. He thought this was a spiritual \nexperience, but it was hallucination. \nNow what is the difference between hallucination and spiritual experience? In hallucination \nyou see things, extraordinary things, but never feel blissful or peaceful. This is the only sure \nsign of differentiating between hallucination and spiritual experience. When it is \nhallucination, bliss and peace are impossible. In delusion, too, bliss and peace are not \npossible, but the confusion as to whether it was hallucination or spiritual experience does \nnot remain. \nIn hallucination, you see strange figures, and yet doubt as to whether they exist or not. In \ndelusion, you take things as existing which really do not exist, but you feel sure they do \nexist. Hallucination is like a conscious nightmare. \nSometimes in your dreams you see events that occur years after, and all of a sudden you \nremember having dreamt it. Sometimes you see such funny things, things that have no \nmeaning, or persons whom you have never seen in this life. But you have either seen them \nin the past, or will see them in the future. \nEvolution progresses from the atom towards the infinite, and the soul gathers its \nimpressions from imagination. Your soul has been through this process for millions of years \nthrough every form. So what you can imagine includes, and has as its basis, all that you have \npassed through. And every soul has to pass through negative and positive experiences. \nYou cannot imagine things that you have not seen. You cannot now imagine being in Persia, \nbecause you have never been there. But you can imagine being in England as you have seen \nEngland. So whatever you see in dreams is hallucination, or the projection of imagination. \nBut it is always something you have seen or will see in the future. \nIn a dream, when you sleep, this body (the physical) is not used, and yet you see, smell, hear, \ntaste, etc. You do it all with the Subtle body, but not consciously. When you do it consciously, \nyou actually experience being aloof from the body. You smell, you eat, you hear, you feel, \ndoing it all as concretely as you do with the Gross body, not vaguely as in dreams. You can \nactually feel the body as a cloak. You put it off and on like a garment, actually, not just in \nyour imagination. \nMarch 1937, \nIndia, \nLA p180-181 \nGarrett Fort: How can you imagine things you have never seen? \nBaba: You have seen things far back, ages back. You can never produce what you have not \nseen. Imagination is infinite. But sometimes you see in your dreams events that occur years \nafter, and all of a sudden you remember having dreamed it. Sometimes you see such funny, \nweird things, having no meaning. Or you see persons you have never seen in this life. But \nyou have either seen them in the past, or will see them in the future. \nFort: When you have dreams of future events, have you seen that? \nBaba: You will see it later, even if you have not seen it yet. Imagination is always something \nyou have seen or will see in the future. \n14 March 1937, \nNasik, \nLM7 p2137-2138 \nAnother version, LA p181 \nThe Master usually helps the aspirant through ordinary means, and prefers to take him \nunder the veil. But when there is a special indication, he may also use an occult medium to \nhelp him. Special types of dreams are among the common media which are used for \ntouching the deeper life of the aspirant. Masters have not infrequently first contacted the \naspirants by appearing in their dreams. Such dreams, however, have to be carefully \ndistinguished from ordinary dreams. \nIn ordinary dreams, the Subtle body is active in exercising its functions of seeing, tasting, \nsmelling, touching and hearing, but the soul is not using the Subtle body with full \nconsciousness. As these experiences of ordinary dreams are received subconsciously, they \nare in most cases purely subjective, relating to physical activities and concerning the Gross \nliving, being the creations of the nascent sanskaras stored in the mind. In some cases, \nhowever, a dream which is indistinguishable from ordinary dreams may be the reflection in \nthe subconscious of some objective experience of the Subtle body, and not merely a product \nof fancy. \nMost dreams are purely subjective and subconscious experiences of the Subtle body, and \nthey have no special spiritual significance, except that they can be the occasions for the \nforging of new sanskaras or the spending up of old ones, and that occasionally they shed a \nlight upon the hidden complexes and unfaced problems of personality. But such dreams can \nnever include something which is not in some way a part of the past experience of the \nperson. And they allow scope for novelty only in respect of new combinations of the items \nwhich have already appeared in past experience. \nThe rare types of dreams are the dreams of persons and things which have been known to \nthe man, not in this life, but in some past life or lives. And even still more rare are the \ndreams of persons and things which have never appeared in his life or lives, but are going to \nappear in his life in the future. Ordinary dreams are thus utterly different from dreams \nwhich have occult significance. \n1941? Di v3 p11-12 \nIn rare cases, in spite of the resistance offered by the brain, some memories of past lives \nleak into the present life in the form of dreams which are entirely unaccountable by means \nof the present life. A man may see in his dreams persons whom he has never seen in his \npresent life. It often happens that the persons who appeared in the dreams were persons \nwhom he had met in his past lives. But of course, such dreams, when they are of the \nordinary type, cannot be treated as memory of the past lives. They merely indicate that the \nimagination which worked in dreams was influenced by materials taken from the past lives \nof the man. \nThe real memory of past lives is clear, steady and sure, like the memory of the present life; \nand when it comes to a man, he has no longer any doubt about his having existed in several \nlives, along with many others. Just as he cannot doubt his own past life in the present \nincarnation, he cannot doubt his life in his past incarnations. \n1942? Di v4 p61 \nAs compared with dreams, the physical life is indeed a reality. Similarly, compared with the \nreality of the Path, the world and all worldly life is vacant dreaming on the part of man. But \nas the world and all of its experiences are illusory, so is the spiritual Path that leads to \nreality. The former may be termed false illusion and the latter real illusion. Nevertheless, \ndespite the vast difference between them, they are both illusions, for God alone is the only \nreality. \nc.1952? GS p73 \nThe dream of a man is but a drama enacted by the projection of man's own dormant \nimpressions. These impressions, when projected through man's subconsciousness, create \nthings and creatures of the dream, as Sub-Subtle forms. Man in the dream state not only \nbecomes involved in the drama of his dream, and plays the roles of both the creator of that \ndream and of the hero in the drama of that dream, but in this drama man also gets closely \nassociated with the things and the creatures in their Sub-Subtle forms, which are of his own \ncreation in his dream state. This creation of Sub-Subtle forms comes entirely as a result of \nthe manifestation of man's own past and present impressions. Thus man in his dream state \nassociates subconsciously with forms in Sub-Subtle states. \nWhen recollected by a man in the awake state, these very forms, which he has seen and \nassociated with in the dream state, remind him of his conscious associations with the Gross \nforms as things, creatures and beings associated with in his day-to-day life of the present, \nand link them with his connections and contacts established in his life of the immediate and \nsometimes distant past. But more often than not, a man also recollects in his conscious \nawake state that a particular Gross form, whether of a thing, creature or being, with which \nhe closely associates, and which he actually seeks, reminds him of having witnessed that \nsame object in his dream at some time in the past, either some days, months or years ago. \nThus it actually happens that a form of the future, which he happened to witness in his \ndream of the past, reappears to the man as a Gross form in his life associations of the \npresent. After a lapse of time the same object, that the man was totally ignorant of ever \nhaving seen or contacted before in his lifetime, appears to him now in the awake state, \nexactly as he had witnessed it before in his dream. Experiences of a similar nature are also \nrecorded in which a man witnesses certain incidents in his dreams years in advance of their \nactual occurrence. \nc.1954, GS p94-95 \nWhen you sleep and dream, you experience association with people, speaking with them \nand doing actions in relation to them, see all manner of objects in your surroundings, and \nfeel happiness or unhappiness in regard to them all. Where do all these people and objects \ncome from? Not from outside yourself, but from within you. You create them for your own \nexperiencing, and no one but you sees, knows about and experiences what you are seeing, \nknowing and experiencing. They exist only for you. \nIn like manner, you are sitting in this room seeing these other persons and the objects in the \nroom, and in like manner, no one but you is seeing them and experiencing them - that is, \nseeing and experiencing them as you are seeing and experiencing them. They exist solely for \nyou, and have come from nowhere but from within you. You have created them for your \nexperience of them. \nWhat is called your awake state, your daily life with all its associations and experiences, is \nonly you dreaming, and in your dream creating all the persons and objects in that dreaming \nfor your experience of them. What is called your dreaming when asleep is but another \ndream within this dream. \nWhen you awake from your asleep-dreaming into your awake dream, you know that the \nasleep-dreaming was only a dream. When you awake from your awake-dreaming, you will \nknow that you were the sole creator of both the dreams, and all the people, objects and \nsituations contained in them - that they existed only in you, and were for no one but you, \nand were nothing but dream experiences of your own dreaming - and that you alone have \nreal existence. When real light appears, this darkness, which you think is light, disappears. \nc.1955, SG p167 \nWhen a Gross-conscious person has a dream, he has, as in his waking state, an experience of \nsome place, and also of some mental state and experience associated with it. But the place, \nmental state and experience with which a person is confronted in his dream do not have the \nsame externality or separateness which characterise them in wakefulness. It will be very \nartificial, and even misleading, if we try to separate the place in the dream from the state \nand the experience connected with it, though such separateness presents us with no \ndifficulty when we are concerned with the place, state and experience in Gross-conscious \nwakefulness. \n1956? Be p85 \nAlthough the most important work of consciousness is always done during the waking state, \ndreams also play their part in helping consciousness through the maze of problems which \nbeset it. As a rule, consciousness passes through the dream-state during the transition from \nwaking to sleep, and while returning from sleep to waking. The dream-state serves as a \nbridge between sleep and waking, but it is not an inevitable phase. The mind may swing \nbetween quiescence and waking without subconsciously passing through the dream phase. \nIn the dream-state, consciousness is not completely dormant as in sleep, nor is it fully active \nas in waking. The dream-state is midway between these two phases, and it marks a \ntransition from latent consciousness to active consciousness. The unique virtue of the \nordinary dream-state is that experiences in it are relatively free from the act of willing, as \nwell as from the rigid social demands which prevail in conscious life. \nDespite the seeming lawlessness of the dream-state, it is nevertheless subject to the \naccumulated mental and emotional impressions (sanskaras) which function as inexorably in \nthe dream state as in the waking. Many inclinations and desires which cannot find \nfulfillment in waking life, seek and find gratification in the self-created subjective world of \ndreams. Likewise, many fears and conflicts buried in the subconscious mind inflict upon the \ndreamer a diversity of suffering which the conscious mind would seek to avoid. \nThus dreamland also invites the experiencing of the opposites. The unique characteristic of \ndream experiences is that they afford an opportunity to work out a number of sanskaric \nimpressions without creating any new physical bondage. Many dreams have the same force \nand directive value that inhere in experiences of the waking-state, but these latter are \nalways accompanied by the simultaneous creation of new emotional and mental \nimpressions (sanskaras) that prove to be just as binding as the age-old impressions that \nlimit man's consciousness. Dream experiences, however, result in no such creation of \nfurther bindings. \nAnother interesting aspect of ordinary dreams is that, regardless of what the dream entails, \nit has no direct effect upon any mind other than the dreamer. This is quite contrary to \nexperiences in the conscious waking-state. These invariably involve and affect many other \nsouls as well, thus complicating many life patterns. The activity of consciousness in the \nwaking state creates a bondage of karmic liabilities and assets from which dream \nexperiences are exempt. \nThe dream world is a type of psychic experimental laboratory, insulated from the demands \nof physical life, and thus possessing some advantage over the waking-state. But because it \ndoes not give play to the directive faculty of the will, and isolates the individual soul from \nother souls, it also suffers severe handicaps from which the waking life is free. \nbefore 1957, LH p121-123 \nYou say that you see me in dreams. These dreams arise from your own impressions formed \nthrough your love and faith in me. Do not attribute them to me. I have come into your midst \nto awaken you from the long, drawn-out dream of illusion, not to create more dreams for \nyou. \nc.1960?  India, EN p40 \nYou are really the infinite soul, but you identify yourself with a finite mind, and so have to \nsuffer. You have your moments of happiness and sorrow. Whether your pains outweigh \nyour pleasures or your pleasures outweigh your pains, you worry all day about something \nor the other until your finite existence retreats at night into sound sleep. There you \nunconsciously merge in the infinite. \nIn sound sleep you completely forget yourself and your surroundings, your thoughts and \nemotions, around which are ranged your ideas of imagined happiness and sufferings. But \nthis respite is short-lived. From the sound-sleep state you come down to the normal awake \nstate, and as you come, you have necessarily to pass through a dream state, even though it \nbe only the fraction of a second. \nNow at one time you have a very happy and sweet dream, in which your ideal of happiness \nis fulfilled. But being a dream, it lasts only a little while. And waking pains you so much that \nyou sigh, 'What a pity it was all a dream.' At some other time you have a horrible dream in \nwhich you experience great suffering. Time seems an eternity. As you wake, you feel such \nrelief that you say, 'Thank God it was only a dream after all.' \nIn the dream state you enjoy and suffer. When you wake, you realise that your enjoyment \nand suffering was nothing but a dream, an illusion. But know that your present state of \nconsciousness, which you call being awake, when compared with the real awake state, is \nnothing but a dream state. Your life is a dream within the mighty dream of God which is the \nuniverse. \nc.1960, India, EN p51-52 \n(A man had dreams in which he found himself flying in the air) \nQ. Baba, has this any special meaning spiritually? \nBaba: What meaning? Only that of a dream. We see birds flying. What does that mean \nspiritually? In ancient times some yogis were so powerful that they, too, could fly like birds. \nFor a lover of God such things are neither important nor essential. \n(Baba asked whether anyone present had had dreams of flying. Some raised their hands.) \nBaba: Then such dreams are not uncommon. (Baba pointed at one of the mandali) Even \nsuch a plump person can fly in a dream. What a wonder! Whether you walk on water or fly \nin air, whether it be in a dream as you had, or in the normal awake state, as the ancient yogis \ndid, these things have no meaning spiritually, or very little meaning, worth ignoring. Try \nhonestly to love God, and you will realise that, except love, all other things are meaningless... \nWhere is God? \nQ. God is in everyone and everything, in every particle of dust. \nBaba: Is this not mere book knowledge? Is this your experience? Even a child can make such \nstatements. So unless you have the experience, it is useless to make such statements. If you \nare really keen about the Truth, try to meditate with love on the divine form of your choice, \nor remember the name of God wholeheartedly. Then, with divine grace, a fortunate one sees \nGod face to face, everywhere and in everything, far more clearly and intimately than you see \nthe things in this room now with your physical eyes. \nBefore the real seeing is revealed, one gets many experiences on the Path. If not rightly \nvalued, these experiences prove very alluring and deceptive. If one starts feeling proud \nabout one's flight in a dream, how much pride will the experiences on the Path nourish? One \nhas to be very watchful about the tricky nature of the ego, which tries to maintain its \nseparateness more and more. One thing is certain: the more importance and attention you \npay to such experiences, the more you get bound. Don't run after the experiences, but \nremain steadfast in your love for God. \nGuruprasad, Poona, 1960, DH p1-4 \nHow can a man know that this is only a vacant dream unless he is awakened from it? The \ndream of the universe is ever real until one is awakened. It is simple and easy to say 'It is all \njust a dream. It is all nothing. It is all absurd and meaningless.' But who honestly \nexperiences it as dream, as nothing, as absurd and meaningless? Only the Realised ones. \nEven though consciousness is full and complete in human form, man still thinks that the \nthings he sees with his Gross eyes are real. He takes them to be real when everything is \nfalse. Why? Because of the sanskaras that make the dream appear to be real. \nIt is as if while sleeping, a man dreams he is a king with a royal court, reigning over all, \nsurrounded by grandeur, singing and merriment. This man is enjoying himself, and is at a \ngreat height, for he is a king among men. And were the Ancient one himself, the mischievous \none who is Meher Baba, to tell him, \"You are a fool - a fool. You are only dreaming. You are \nnot a king in the least,\" the man would not believe it. But later, when he awakens, he soon \nrealises that it was a dream and nothing but a dream after all. All that he valued in the \ndream is now meaningless, because it is nothing but the stuff that dreams are made of - \nsanskaras. \nIn the  same way, though awake, the whole world is dreaming. The people of the world do \nnot know that they are dreaming, so deceptive, so binding are the sanskaras, that stuff that \nmakes dreams and more dreams. \nPeople marry while dreaming, have children and homes, work, play, fornicate, fight, love, \nhate, theorise, intellectualise and philosophise, thinking it is all real, when not one \nexperience is real. \nWhen death comes, man leaves his family behind, loses everything that he worked and \nfought for so hard, including his identity, and experiences heaven or hell, but returns again \ninto another man or woman form with a new identity, having forgotten the past. So \neverything and everyone goes on and on - new families, new affairs, different values. \nDeaths and births are as insubstantial as waking and sleeping. The human consciousness \nchanges, not the species, and sometimes experiences itself in the form of a man and \nsometimes as a woman, healthy and sick, sometimes rich, sometimes poor, intelligent and \nstupid, ugly and beautiful, sane and insane, black and white and so forth, 8,400,000 rounds. \nIt is the human consciousness that experiences the diversity of living in one country and \nthen in another, with different beliefs and customs, for ages and ages, before and after \nrecorded history. The diverse human experiences are tremendous, as the sanskaric patterns \ndiffer with each individual; in this sense, the uniqueness makes it an adventure. But the goal \nis to become awakened, and to achieve that state the Jeevatma finally realises, after \ncountless cycles of births and deaths, that it's self is not outer consciousness. \nWhen what one sees has no reality, the inevitable must occur: the consciousness looks \nwithin and begins the inner journey, and the Jeevatma again dreams, but this time the \ndream is divine. \nWhen the Jeevatma begins the inner journeys, it means he dreams the divine dream of \nbecoming God. 'I will become God - I will know him, and thereby become him' ... \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1967, NE p56-58 \nIn the ordinary awake state, energy and matter manifest in Gross form. In the ordinary \ndream state, energy and matter manifest in Sub-Subtle form, meaning the breath is drawn \nwithin (inhaled), and becomes internal in a semi-Gross form. \nIn the dream state, the dreamer has an impression of energy in a Gross sanskaric form; the \nGross sanskaras of the person are in a partially non-functioning state; Gross action stops, \nbut certain predominant Gross thoughts remain. \nThe impressions one has while dreaming are also a result of sanskaras accumulated from \npast lives, which give rise to situations in dreams that are associated with the present. The \npast molds the future; for this reason, dreams can probe into the future but do not fully \nreveal the future. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1967, NE p305 \nDreams Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

In Gujarati we call it chaha, which also \nmeans love. Both these chahas, if confined within material limits, have no spiritual value. \nOne chaha (tea) is injurious to health if taken in excess, and the other chaha (love) may be \ninjurious to spiritual growth if it is for tea and sense-pleasures. \n5 August 1926, \nMeherabad? \nQM p25 \nAlso Ms p1:11 p6-7 \nStrong tea provides a very good stimulant to tired nerves. But it causes no real \nimprovement in health. On the contrary, the general health is usually undermined with \nstrong stimulants. \n26 November 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p982 \nWine is good for both health and the spiritual life. It is an intoxicant and tonic for both. If \nafter drinking wine, thoughts are diverted to spiritual advancement, it is a great push \ntoward the goal. Otherwise it can lead to hell. Wine is such that either it raises you to the \nhighest pinnacle, or makes you fall into the deepest ditch. \nThe main object of intoxicants in the ancient past was spiritual. Seekers then used not only \nwine, but also hemp, heroin, hashish and opium; so much so that even Qutubs would \nindulge in them (You have heard stories that Sai Baba used to smoke a chillum pipe, and \nUpasani Maharaj smoked beedis). But eventually during those times, ordinary people \nindulged in these intoxicants for the wrong reasons. They could not understand their \nproper use, and the effects of the intoxication diverted their thoughts to carnal desires - \nworst of all to lust, the greatest obstacle in the way. In the spiritual Path, lust is the greatest \nobstacle. \nSeptember 1929, \nIsfahan, Persia, \nLM4 p1227 \nQ. Is your aim to help us with our spiritual problems, or our practical problems? \nBaba: Our spiritual problems are our practical ones. \nQ. And just how do you intend to help? \nBaba: The help I will give will produce a change of heart in thousands, and then right \nthinking and living will result automatically. \nQ. Will that solve the depression problem? \nBaba: It will solve every problem. \nQ. Prohibition? \nBaba: Yes, and the problem behind prohibition. I do not believe in drink, and none of my \nfollowers drink. But I know that prohibition should never have been put in effect the way it \nwas. \nQ. All at once? \nBaba: Yes. Spirits should have been barred, but not beer and wine. Then we might have had \na law that could be enforced. As it is, we have a law which makes money for dishonest \nofficials, and increases all vices everywhere. \nI believe in self-control, not in coercion. Coercion is based on oppression, and results in fear \nand hatred. Self control requires courage, and may be induced by love. We will do many \nthings for those whom we love which we would not ordinarily do - which we would not \nordinarily have the strength of mind and power to do. How many habits have we been able \nto break through love, which we would never have had the strength to break without love? \nAnd when the love is universal love, all habits which are detrimental, either to the \nindividual or to the social order, will be dissolved in its light. \nInterview with Frederick Collins, \n18 May 1932, New York \npublished in Liberty Magazine as \n'I Can Hardly Believe it Myself: A Portait of a Happy Man, \nSilent Seven Years, Who is Seeking to Right the World Through Love.' \nAnother (partial) version: LM5 p1621-1622 \nFor all human beings, materialists as well as spiritual aspirants, use of tobacco or wine in \nany form, of bhang-ganja and opium, etc., is injurious, physically, mentally and spiritually. \nTea or coffee, though injurious, is not so injurious as tobacco, alcohol, bhang-ganja, and \nother strong intoxicants. Rather these - tea or coffee - are in some cases beneficial, \nparticularly when medically advised and taken in mild form. Excessive use of these, and in \nstronger forms, is as injurious as tobacco, alcohol, etc. \nMG 3:1 p22, \nMarch-April 1934 \nWhy does a man commit suicide? Because he expects to find happiness in death. Why does \nanother man drink? It is because of the happiness he expects to derive from alcohol. But \nwhat happiness is derived, and how long does it last? So long as the effect of intoxication \nlasts. No sooner does it cool down than he feels broken, dejected and miserable. \n11 July 1934, \nFeldmeilen, Switzerland, \nLM6 p1892 \nRecourse to alcohol for drowning one's sorrows is a perverted form of solace. Solace \nafforded by things outside of you is synonymous with doping, which gives a certain amount \nof relief or relaxation. Real and unalloyed solace is within you. \n1930s, A p26 \nThe only possible means is the spiritual change of heart. That only will make people \nsatisfied. They want to be satisfied. They themselves do not know what they want. When \nthey get that, they will be satisfied. For instance, why do people drink? Those, say peasants \nor laborers, who labor hard all day, when they come home after the day's work, drink for \nstimulation. But if they get something else instead, they would be satisfied with that, and so \non, until the desire for stimulation disappears. So for all material satisfaction created \nthrough desire and want, spiritual upliftment is needed. \n1930s, A p43 \nAlcoholic drinks in ordinary moderate doses act as stimulants and are harmless. If taken in \nexcess they are harmful. Drugs, whether in small or large doses, are injurious. They have a \ncharacteristic of making the users addicts. Starting from small doses and very subtly, they \ntempt the partakers to increase the quantity indiscriminately until they cannot do without \nthem and become addicted. Tobacco and smoking has only the slight advantage of deriving \nsuperficial pleasure, which is temporary. But there are three distinct disadvantages: \nphysical, mental and habitual. Physically, it spoils the system, and mentally, it tortures one \nwhen unavailable. \n23 February 1938, \nLM7 p2267 \nThe state of ecstasy brought about by music or by some extraneous influence like drugs \ndoes not mean spirituality. It is a state in which the mind overpowers itself, and is a \nweakness to be guarded against. Instead of running wild, the mind should be self-composed. \nThis comes through control. \nbefore 1948, \nST p114 \n... It is a fact that once in a great while I give wine to my lovers, and make them understand \nthat it is not this wine of grapes, but the true wine of love, giving divine intoxication, that \nhelps toward union with God. \n1 March 1953, \nRishikesh, \nLC p20, \nalso LB p67-68 \nWine is prepared by the crushing and further crushing of grapes, when it acquires the \ncapacity for intoxication, which usually takes away one's command of understanding. Close \nand repeated feeling of love for God also brings intoxication, but this takes you towards true \nunderstanding. \n1954? \nIndia, \nMD p16-17 \nOne who is addicted to opium (eating or smoking) derives a... feeling of well-being, though \ntemporarily. After a time the opium addict begins to feel the after-effects of opium in severe \nconstipation, loss of appetite, headache, dullness and drowsiness. He then begins to realise \nthat it would have been better had he not become addicted. But unfortunately, he cannot \ngive up the habit. He has become a slave. He realises this too late, and sinks into deeper \naddiction, being tempted to take greater and greater quantities of opium to keep pace with \nthe gradual loss of the feeling of well-being... \nAfter years of addiction, it so happens one day that the opium addict is found lying \nunconscious in a gutter full of filth. An extra overdose of opium proves tragic for the addict, \nwho loses complete control over himself. The passer-by scoffs, ridicules, points at him as a \nconfirmed opium addict... \n... An opium addict has his personal friends who extol the effect of opium and bring into \ntheir fold innocent people... An opium addict feels happy to give a tiny bit of opium to \nanother, and that other, when he gets the taste of it, hands over another small dose to his \nown friend, creating a circle of opium eaters... \nPL p67-69 \nTell those that are (taking drugs) that if drugs could make one realise God, then God is not \nworthy of being God. No drugs. Many people in  India smoke hashish and ganja. They see \ncolors and forms and lights, and it makes them elated. But this elation is only temporary. It \nis a false experience. It gives only experience of illusion, and serves to take one farther away \nfrom reality... \nTell those who indulge in these drugs (LSD etc.) that it is harmful physically, mentally and \nspiritually, and that they should stop taking these drugs. Your duty is to tell them, \nregardless of whether they accept what you say, or if they ridicule or humiliate you, to \nboldly and bravely face these things. Leave the results to me. I will help you in my work... \nYou are to bring my message to those ensnared in the drug-net of illusion, that they should \nabstain, that the drugs will bring more harm than good. I send my love to them. \n17 November 1965, \nto Robert Dreyfus \nThe Glass Pearl, ed. \nNaosherwan Anzar \nGo back to the  U.S.A. Spread my love among others, particularly among the young, and \npersuade them to desist from taking drugs, for they are harmful physically, mentally, \nspiritually. \nNovember 1965, \nto Robert Dreyfus, \nMeherazad, \nLA p638 \nIf God can be found through the medium of any drug, God is not worthy of being God. \nLA p638 \nTaking LSD is harmful physically, mentally and spiritually. But if you take me into your \nheart and love me as your real self, you will find me in you as the infinite ocean of \neffulgence. And this experience will remain continuously throughout eternity. \nc.1966, India, \nfor a printed card to be distributed \nin the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco \nAw 11:3 p4 \nNow in  India, since ages, there are those who have been used to drugs -- they are drug \naddicts. They are the ones who take ganja, then they take charas, and bhang -- and they feel \nuplifted when they take these drugs. And they see colors and signs, and they feel, through \ntheir hallucinations, that they have reached the goal. \nAnd that false experience is also not continuous. There is a break in their experience. And \nthat is the reason why it is not real. \nThose who take ganja and drugs, they get uplifted through the drugs, and then, in the end, \nthey go crazy -- mad... \nNow we come to those persons who have experiences through drugs. They feel that they \nhave realised God because they get certain experiences. But... the guideline is that their \nexperience is not continuous. Even though that is hallucination, even that is not continuous. \nAnd that is the sign that it is not true experience. It is harmful physically, mentally, \nspiritually. Such experiences are harmful physically, mentally and spiritually. \n1967, Meherazad, \nto Louis van Gasteren \ntranscribed from a video of his filmed \ninterview with Meher Baba \nDrugs Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

If possible, observe celibacy. If already married, keep as little sexual intercourse with \nyour partner as possible. Consider, if you are a man, all other women as your sisters; if you \nare a woman, all other men as your brothers. \n2. Avoid all animal food, except milk and the products of milk. Don't partake of even eggs. \n3. Avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea is not an intoxicant, provided it is weak. But \nbe moderate in your habit of tea drinking. \n4. Curb yourself, and never give way to anger. Whenever you fly into a passion, you contract \nred sanskaras, which are the worst of all.\" \nMeher Baba, Ms 2:2 p8 \n(February 1930) \n\"Do not take intoxicating alcohol or liquor.\" \nMeher Baba, February 1937, \nindividual instruction to Garrett Fort, LM6 p2117 \nBaba instructed Suloo Meshram: he should never tell a lie to anyone; he should abstain from \nlustful actions, smoking and alcohol; he should not eat meat, fish or eggs; to meditate for an \nhour every day; and to write 'Om Parabrahma Baba' for another hour daily.\" \nGG6 p65-66 \nand LM7 p2277 (April 1938) \n\"Drunkards, when they get drunk, challenge 'Come one, come all.' It's not the drunkards \nwho say it, but their intoxication.\" \nMeher Baba, 7 July 1940, \nRanchi, LM7 p2579 \n\"Towards the end of World War II, Baba was with the disciples staying in Dehra Dun... On \nBaba's birthday... Baba... said that he would give us a little wine. In all the years I was with \nhim, I do not remember this happening more than three times. \n\"We sat round the room, crosslegged on the floor, and suddenly this wine went to my head. \nLooking at Baba, I felt and saw that he was Easter Sunday. This may sound like nonsense, \nbut as a child that day had always meant for me that light had come after the dark winter. \n\"Baba then called me and I sat on the floor beside his chair, with my head on his knee. After \na time he leaned down and spelled on the board: 'Tonight is heaven.' \n\"I had a moment of truth and stammered out, 'Yes, but tomorrow won't be.' Baba laughed.\" \nMargaret Craske, \n\"The Dance of Love\" p160-161 \n\"Do not stress pork, alcohol or tobacco in the West. Tell them that what comes out of the \nmouth is far more important than what goes into it.\" \nMeher Baba, \n1950s? to Ivy Duce, \ndiscussing the training of her Sufi students, HM p205 \n\"... Meher Baba directs me to send you his blessings and love, and to inform you that he is \nhappy you have been remembering him in the course of your studies. Meher Baba wants \nyou to study the book God Speaks, for it will help you to understand the mystery of life \nephemeral and the truth of existence eternal. The book God Speaks is a very important \ntextbook for all students who are keen to understand the fundamental purpose and \nmechanics of life and the universe. God Speaks reveals to us that all experiences, even of \nspiritual aspirants on the path to God-realisation 'gotten in the natural course of involution \nof consciousness' are of the domain of illusion. \n\"Therefore, how much more distracting are the experiences of a layman in a laboratory who \nexperiments with drugs to induce experiences with the semblance of those of an aspirant on \nthe spiritual path? Meher Baba has said that the one and true experience is the experience \nof Truth, the reality, for once the realisation of God is attained, it remains a continual and \nnever-ending experience. The all-pervading effulgence of God the reality is experienced by \nan aspirant who keeps himself scrupulously above all illusory experimentations, and \nhumbly takes refuge in the love of God... \n\"It is absolutely essential for a spiritual aspirant who genuinely longs for union with God, \nthe reality, to shun false practices of yogic postures and exercises, meditation on other than \nGod the beloved, experiments with certain drugs, and fads for types of food. These things do \nnot uplift the aspirant, nor do they draw him out of the rut of illusion. Experiences born of \nthese practices wear off no sooner than the aspirant withdraws from, or is thrown out of, \nthe orbit of the effects produced by the technique employed. \n\"All so-called spiritual experiences generated by taking mind-changing drugs (such as LSD, \nmescaline and psilocybin mentioned in your letter) are superficial, and they add \nenormously to one's addiction to the deceptions of illusion, which is but the shadow of \nreality. The experience of a semblance of freedom that these drugs may temporarily give to \none is in actuality a millstone round the aspirant's neck in his efforts towards emancipation \nfrom the rounds of birth and death. \n\"It is good to know that there are drugs that alleviate human sufferings, it is better to have a \nknowledge of a specific drug for a particular ailment, and it is best to put to use the specific \ndrug for the benefit of a human body. But there is no drug that can promote the aspirant's \nprogress, nor ever alleviate the suffering of separation from his beloved God. Love is the \nonly propeller and the only remedy. The aspirant should love God with all his heart, until he \nforgets himself and recognises his beloved God in himself and others...\" \nAdi K. Irani, in a letter to Alan Cohen, 10 October 1964 \nLF p98-100, also The Glass Pearl \n\"Tell those that are (taking drugs) that if drugs could make one realise God, then God is not \nworthy of being God. No drugs. Many people in  India smoke hashish and ganja. They see \ncolors and forms and lights, and it makes them elated. But this elation is only temporary. It \nis a false experience. It gives only experience of illusion, and serves to take one farther away \nfrom reality... \n\"Tell those who indulge in these drugs (LSD etc.) that it is harmful physically, mentally and \nspiritually, and that they should stop taking these drugs. Your duty is to tell them, \nregardless of whether they accept what you say, or if they ridicule or humiliate you, to \nboldly and bravely face these things. Leave the results to me. I will help you in my work... \n\"You are to bring my message to those ensnared in the drug-net of illusion, that they should \nabstain, that the drugs will bring more harm than good. I send my love to them. \nMeher  Baba, \n17 November 1965, \nto Robert Dreyfus \nThe Glass Pearl, ed. \nNaosherwan Anzar \n\"Baba asked how I got into drugs and asked, 'Are there many young people taking these \nthings?' I said, 'Yes, Baba, very many.' And he said they were very harmful mentally, \nphysically and spiritually... Baba said that many people in India smoke hashish, that they see \ncolored lights and forget their problems just for a little while, and then they come right back \nto the problems which they still have to face, and that the energy that had been spent, or \nmisspent, in being high was simply wasted. He looked at me very sternly and said 'No drugs. \nNo drugs.' \n\"... Baba said I should go back to the West and spread his message of love and truth among \nthe young people, to tell them about what he had to say about drugs, and not to take drugs. \nHe said if the young people in this country continue using drugs, it would lead eventually to \nmadness or death for many...\" \nRobert Dreyfus, about his visit with Baba at Meherazad \nin November 1965. Meher News Exchange, June 1976 \nAllan Cohen wrote a letter to Meher Baba, asking the following questions: \n'Does brain damage occur when LSD is being used for medical purposes? If so, how severe? \nIs there any way to repair this damage? Did Baba say that LSD was also deleterious to the \nliver and kidneys? Did Baba say that LSD affected the areas of the brain reserved for Subtle \nand Mental consciousness, and that the LSD user could never arrive at Subtle consciousness \nin this incarnation unless he gave himself to a Perfect Master? What are the physical effects \nor dangers of continued LSD use for non-medical purposes?' \nBaba answered through Adi K. Irani: \n1. Baba did say the user of LSD could  never reach Subtle consciousness in this incarnation \ndespite its repeated use, unless the person surrendered to a Perfect Master. To experience \nreal spiritual consciousness, surrenderance to a Perfect Master is necessary. \n2. The experiences gained through LSD are in some cases experiences of the shadows of the \nSubtle plane in the Gross world. These experiences have nothing at all to do with spiritual \nadvancement. \n3. Repeated use of LSD leads to insanity, which may prove incurable even with LSD \ntreatment. \n4. Medical use of LSD helps to cure  in some cases  mental disorders and madness. \n5. There is no such thing as 'areas in the brain reserved for Subtle consciousness,' and the \nquestion of LSD affecting them has no meaning. \n6. When LSD is used for genuine medical purposes, in controlled doses, under the \nsupervision of specialists, there are no chances of brain, liver or kidney  being damaged. \n7. Continued use of LSD for non-medical purposes results in madness, and death eventually. \n1966? India, \nThe Glass Pearl, ed. \nNaosherwan Anzar \n\"No drug, whatever its great promise, can help one to attain the spiritual goal. There is no \nshortcut to the goal except through the grace of the Perfect Master, and drugs, LSD more \nthan others, gives only a semblance of spiritual experiences, a glimpse of the false reality. \nThe experiences you elaborate in your letter are as far removed from reality as is a mirage \nfrom water. No matter how much you pursue the mirage, you will never reach water, and \nthe search for God through drugs must end in disillusionment... \n\"To a few sincere seekers such as yourself, LSD may have served as a means to arouse that \nspiritual longing that brought you into contact with Meher Baba, but once that purpose is \nserved, further ingestion would not only be harmful, but have no point or purpose. Now \nyour longing for reality cannot be sustained by further use of drugs, but only by your own \nlove for the Perfect Master, which is a reflection of his love for you... \n\"And so, although LSD may lead one to feel a better man personally, the feeling of having \nhad a glimpse of reality may not only lull one into a false security, but also will, in the end, \nderange one's mind. Although LSD is not an addiction-forming drug, one can become \nattached to the experiences arising from its use, and one gets tempted to use it in increased \ndoses again and again, in the hope of deeper and deeper experiences. But eventually this \ncauses madness or death.\" \nAdi K. Irani, \nwriting for Meher Baba, 1966? in \nreply to a letter from Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) \n\"The use of intoxicating drugs in general is prohibited by Baba. However, he permits the use \nof wine within limits. As such, wine may be used, within limits, to celebrate Baba occasions \nlike birthdays.\" \nAdi K. Irani, \n9 March 1967, \nin a letter to Ena Lemmon, \nTK p216 For more about wine, \nsee TK p269-270 \nAbout psychedelic drugs: \n\"Now I shall write to you what once I directly heard from Baba about the nature of \nexperience one gets after taking drugs. To understand what Baba exactly said, I should first \nexplain different aspects of consciousness. \n\"Normally a man experiences three aspects of consciousness: sound sleep, in which there is \nneither consciousness nor unconsciousness; dream state, which has dream-consciousness; \nand waking state, which has full Gross consciousness. \n\"An experience is valid when the one who experiences and the objects of experience both \nbelong to the same plane of consciousness, as in the waking-state, in which both the subject \nand object belong to the Gross plane, and so the experience is valid. \n\"In a spiritually advanced state (not of a yogi) of a mast, the subject and object belong to one \nplane of consciousness, whether it is first, second or third and so on planes, and the \nexperience is valid. \n\"In a dream one goes into a Subtle plane, but the objects that he experiences belong to the \nGross plane, and so the experience is not valid, because the planes of the subject and object \nare not the same. \n\"Reverse is the case in a yoga-consciousness. A yogi experiences Subtle plane objects, but \nfrom the Gross plane, and so the experience is not valid. \n\"Now, what Baba said about drug experience is this: After taking a drug, one experiences \nshadow of the Subtle plane objects from the Gross plane, and so the experience is not only \nnot valid, but full of grotesque sights and feelings much more unreal and confounding than \nfantasies, and so harmful spiritually, mentally and physically.\" \nAdi K. Irani, 28 March 1973, unpublished letter \nMeher Baba told Francis Brabazon and Joseph Harb to smoke no more than five cigarettes a \nday. Joseph was unable to limit himself to five, so he quit entirely. \nFor more about smoking cigarettes, see HM p189-190. \nDrugs Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "FOLLOWING MEHER BABA \nMeher Baba \nLove me and you will know me. But I am such a reality that it is extremely difficult to know \nme. The price is love. No repetition of God's name, no penance, and no meditation is \nnecessary. Only love, and such love that it annihilates your ego. This means your love should \nbe so deep that it makes you forget yourself and the world. This experience will leave you \ndesireless, dazed and confounded. This is real love. \nYou have feeling for me in your hearts, and because of it you may remember me often \nduring the day, but you do not continuously. This feeling or devotion, though good, is not \nlove. It should not be mistaken for love, because that real love, which is to see and know \nGod, cannot be created. It has to be bestowed. It is bestowed through the grace of the \nMaster, and such grace is conferred on a very, very lucky few. \nStill, do not be discouraged. Although you do not have the love that is needed, you have deep \nfeeling for me. Try always to remember me and to speak of me. This is the best beginning - \nthe determination to be ready to receive the Master's grace. If this continues, a day will \ncome when you will be the lucky one to receive the great gift - the bestowal of my love. To \nbe ready, perpetuate this feeling in your heart and increase it, making it deeper and deeper. \nHow to begin? Remember me before starting and after finishing any work. Think of me \nbefore doing anything. If you have to write something, remember me before starting, and \nthen mentally say, 'Baba, it is you, not I, who is writing.' \nA tavern-keeper first receives cash from a customer before handing him the wine glass. He \nchecks the coin to ascertain whether it is genuine or counterfeit. Similarly, the Sadguru also \ndemands his price - not in money, but in love, before giving you the gift of love. You can \ndeceive a wine-seller by passing him counterfeit coins, but never a Sadguru. He has no use \nfor false coins - the show of love. With me, before the exchange takes place, one has to pay \nthe full price. The price of knowing me is love - love, pure and simple. \nBut love entails pain - the pain of the pangs and thirst of separation while constantly \nburning. This gradually minimises the strength of the ego, and eventually destroys it, \nbecause love never thinks of or cares for itself. It just burns its victim in love for its beloved. \nThis burning gradually diminishes the ego, and thus it is eventually totally annihilated. In \nthis fire, love makes its victim realise the self. \n30 March 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1293 \nPeople pray to me to solve their difficulties, saying that they love me. But there is a vast \ndifference between love and prayer. \nIn Persian to pray means to beg, to want, to desire something, even the blessings of God. But \nwhen a person really loves, he gives himself over to his beloved completely. This is true \nlove. In that there is no begging, no wanting, and no room for desires. Only the longing to \nunite with the beloved remains. \nLove means the renunciation of the self. Prayer means selfishness, no matter how high the \nprayer may be. So there is a vast difference between when one prays and when one loves. \nJuly 1931, \nKarachi, \nLM4 p1374 \nThose who are united in love know no separation. Wherever I am, wherever you are, I am \nalways with you. My love and blessings to you all. \n15 November 1934, \nIndia, \nMe p7 \nLove the one in the many, and not the many in the one. I am the only friend who will never \nlet you down. \nto Kitty Davy, \n1937? \nIndia? \nLA p165 \nHonestly, there are many ways of testing love and faith. Love always seeks the will, the \nhappiness, the pleasure and the commands of the beloved, always. Love never thinks of \nitself. That is love - that is God. When you say you love me, do you love me? \nDid I ever tell you the story of Ramdas and Kalyan? Ramdas was a spiritual Master at the \ntime of Shivaji. He had many disciples, the favorite among whom was Kalyan. Ramdas \nwanted to test his devotion. He asked all his disciples to come together, and he pretended to \nbe sick to the point of death. He had put a mango over the knee-joint to simulate swelling, \nand bound it up. It seemed to be swollen like a tumor, which Ramdas said it was. Then he \nasked his disciples whether any of them would suck out the poison from the knee-joint, \nsaying that whoever did so would die in his place, but that he would be pleased. While all \nthe other disciples hesitated, Kalyan arose immediately and sucked the knee-joint. But \ninstead of poison, he sucked the juice of the mango. \nThis is love - to be ready to die for love of the beloved, for the happiness of the beloved. All \nthis means love, faith and sacrifice. If you do what I ask willingly, you really love me. If you \nare made to do it, you love me a little less. But if you do not do it, it all comes to today's \nmango business.* \nGod's grace makes you love me. My grace makes you one with me. \n19 May 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p172-173 \nOther versions: \nAw 16:2 p54, Di (7th ed.) p149-150, \n*\"One afternoon when we were with Baba in the sitting room, he distributed mangoes, \npreparing each one himself, laying aside the less good ones and giving us the best. Some \nhesitated, and some refused the fruit.\"    Kitty Davy \nWhat is love? To give, and never to ask. \nWhat leads to this love? Grace. \nWhat leads to this grace? Grace is not cheaply bought. It is gained by being always ready to \nserve, and reluctant to be served. There are many points which lead to this grace: \nWishing well for others at the cost of one's self. \nNever backbiting. \nTolerance supreme. \nTrying not to worry. Trying not to worry is almost impossible - so try. \nThinking more of the good points in others, and less of their bad points. \nWhat leads to this grace? Doing all the above. If you do one of these things perfectly, the rest \nmust follow. Then grace descends. Have love - and when you have love, the union with the \nbeloved is certain. \nWhen Christ said, 'Love your neighbor,' he did not mean fall in love with your neighbor. \nWhen you love, you give; when you fall in love, you want. \nLove me in any way you like, but love me. It is all the same. Love me. I am pure, the source of \npurity, so I consume all weaknesses in my fire of love. Give your sins, weaknesses, virtues, \nall to me, but give. I would not mind even one falling in love with me - I can purify. But when \nyou fall in love with anybody else, you cannot call it love. Love is pure as God. It gives and \nnever asks. That needs grace. \nYogis in the Himalayas, with their long eyelashes and long beards, meditating, sitting in \nsamadhi, they too, have not this love, it is so precious. The mother dies for her child - \nsupreme sacrifice - yet it is not love. Heroes die for their country, but that is not love. Love - \nyou know when you have love. You cannot understand theoretically, you have to experience \nit. \nMajnu loved Leila. This was pure love - not physical, not intellectual, but spiritual love. He \nsaw Leila in everything and everywhere. He never thought of eating, drinking, sleeping, \nwithout thinking of her, and all the time he wanted her happiness. He would have gladly \nseen her married to another if he knew that would make her happy, and die for her husband \nif he thought she would be happy in that. At last it led him to me - no thought of self, but of \nthe beloved, every second and continually. \nYou would not be able to do that if you tried. It needs grace. Trying leads to grace. \nWhat is God? Love. Infinite love is God. \n28 May 1937, \nNasik, PL p76-77. \nOther versions: \nLA p192-194, LM6 p2184-2185 \nThe following instructions, if carried out wholeheartedly by you, will allow you to help my \nwork of spiritualising the world. \nThey are not to be treated like long-established sermons - read, heard and forgotten. They \nare not to be understood in the light of philosophical slogans preached merely for the sake \nof preaching. They are simple, eternal truths which I want all of you to try your utmost to \nlive. \nThe instructions are: \n1. Amidst all your duties and attachments, let the background of all your thoughts be only \nthe one thought that 'God alone is real, and all else is illusion.' \n2. Infuse into others the idea that the ultimate goal of all life is to know God in his true, \ninfinite aspect. \n3. Think less of yourself, and more of others, by trying to make others happy, even if you \nhave to suffer for it. \n4. Learn for yourself, and teach others \nthat recognition of God's will means not to complain of your lot; \nthat control of the mind means not to be upset by misfortunes; \nthat loving all as children of the same one God means not to be jealous of anyone, and not to \nhurt the feelings of anyone. \n15 May 1943, \nMeherabad, to a gathering \nof 125 male devotees, \nLM8 p2873-2874 \nThe spiritual Path is like climbing up to the mountain-top through hills and dales and thorny \nwoods, and along steep and dangerous precipices. But on this Path there can be no going \nback or halting. Everyone must get to the top, which is the direct realisation of the supreme \nGodhead. All hesitation or sidetracking or resting in the halfway houses is but \npostponement of the day of true and final fulfillment. \nYou cannot be too alert on this Path. Even the slightest of lingering in the false world of \nshadows is necessarily an invitation to some suffering which could have been avoided if the \neyes had been steadily fixed on the supreme goal of life. \nIf there is one thing which is most necessary for safe and sure arrival at the top, it is love. All \nother qualifications which are essential for the aspirants of the highest can and must come \nto them if they faithfully follow the whispers of the unerring guide of love, who speaks from \nwithin their own hearts and sheds light on the Path. \nIf you lose hold of the mantle of this guide, there is only despair in store for you. The heart \nwithout love is entombed in unending darkness and suffering. But the heart which is \nrestless with love is on the way to realisation of the unfading light and the unfathomable \nsweetness of life divine. \nHuman love should not be despised, even when it is fraught with limitations. It is bound to \nbreak through all these limitations and initiate the aspirant into the eternal life in the Truth, \nso that the lover loses his separate and false self, and gets united with God, who is the one \nmatchless and indivisible ocean of unsurpassable love. \nThe gateway to this highest state of being one with God is firmly closed for all who do not \nhave the courage to lose their separate existence in the restless fire of divine love. I give my \nblessings to all who are thirsting for the full realisation of divinity, for they shall be the \npillars of the coming era of Truth and love. \n12 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p69-70 \nThere is nothing which is beyond me, and there is nothing without me. Yet I am and can \nalways be captured with love. \n1947, Surat, Aw 7:2 p3 \nWhat does love mean? We find volumes and volumes written. There are very few who have \nfound love and who have it. \nNone present here loves me as I ought to be loved. You are not conscious of my real state, \nbecause you do not love me as I love you. The Mandali are fully prepared to lay down their \nlives for me. Even they do not love me as I love them. Had they that love, they would become \none with me. \nYou and I remain divided by no other veil than you yourself, that is, the 'I' in you. For \nexample, you see a very beautiful girl, and you fall in love with her. There is so much unrest. \nYour whole mind is on that. You forget hunger and sleep, etc. I am talking of real love for \nworldly beings, not mere lust. \nBut love for me expects much more than this, much more than a fish out of water. It is not \neasy for all. Rarely one person can try to cope with that love. Had I been in your place, I \nwould not have been able to love myself as I ought to be loved. That is a fact. \nWhat does 'you' mean? 'I' am hungry, 'I' am unwell, 'I' slept well, 'my' son died. I, me, mine -- \nthese are veils. The moment this veil disappears you realise me as yourself. Difficulties \ndisappear with the touch of love for me. \nRepeat my name not less than 14 times (a day), but more often as you can, 'Baba, Baba, \nBaba...' One day in an instant that veil will be ripped open. Do it with love. I tell you this with \nall authority. Millions of births are not sufficient to remove that veil that love can lift in a \nflash. Otherwise it requires cycles of cycles of births. \nMan cannot possess love by means of anything except the gift of the one who possesses that \nlove. No sooner you are gifted with that love, there is no duality. \nYou can't bargain for love. No amount of penance, meditation, puja, etc. can give that gift of \nlove. Once that gift comes from God, it burns up all veils of sanskaras. \nHe alone knows the real meaning of love who receives the gift of love from God. That lover \nwho so receives it cannot express it to others. His mouth is stitched, and not even smoke \ncomes out. No sooner is love visible, and others can sense that he is a lover of God (e.g. by \ntears, japa, puja, etc.), he is not the lover of God really. I tell you with my authority. \nThe gift of love knows no law. To love me for health, wealth, etc. is not love for me, but love \nonly for all those things. \n1955, Meherabad, LJ p63-64 \njapa: repeating a name of God \npuja: ritual worship \nThose who love me are mine. The whole world is mine. You are all mine. Everything is mine. \nAll are mine. Every individual here is mine. The whole universe is mine. \nI am the one for those who love me. I am only his who loves me. \nWrite these words in your hearts. All are mine. The one who loves me is mine, whether he \nbe sitting near me or staying miles away from me. That is a fact. \nI want you all to be happy. Don't feel worried. Don't feel nervous. I want you all to go \nhappily and cheerfully. I know everything. Take me with you fully. Take as much of me as \nyou can with you. \n1955, Meherabad, LJ p86 \nBaba is eternally happy, yet eternally suffering. He is free here as Baba, but in you as Baba \nhe is bound. If you loved me truly with all your heart, you could be as free as I. Then it would \nbe unbroken eternal bliss. \nMy sister Mani loves me very much. She doesn't worry about anything. She simply obeys \nme. From morning till night she is working for Baba. She knows Baba is God and loves Baba \nas God. Mehera I love very much due to past connections. I love you too. If you love me, you \nare with me. Then you come to me. Through love, you can become one with me. \nMy brother Jamshed loved me very much. He was mad with love for me. Once he was so full \nof love for me that he couldn't contain himself and dropped his body. But just before dying \nhe shouted out loudly, 'Baba!' He has come to me. He is now with me eternally. \nWhat I want to convey to you all is that my brothers and sister love me very much. Some of \nmy school friends, with whom I had played marbles in the street, had disputed mildly and \nquarreled, also love me because I am God. They believe me when I say that. It is not just a \ntheory for them; they see something greater. They have that conviction. They believe that I \nam God. \nYou also believe that I am God. You do love me, I know. But it was very difficult to love me, \nto respect me, to believe in me, to have the conviction that I am God, for one who had played \nmarbles with me, for one who had quarreled with me, who had sat beside me at the same \ndesk in school. Don, do you follow what I say? (Don Stevens nodded) \nIt was very difficult for them, for my old school friends, and my own family, but they love \nme... they are ready to give their lives for me. My father Sheheriarji, such a sweet soul, was a \ngreat lover of God. He roamed about from place to place on foot in search of Truth. Later on, \nhe used to worship me. He had a photo of me in his private room. He used to light a candle \nthere. He used to worship my photo and me. \nI tell you all with authority, as I have been telling others at other places: I am the Ancient \none. When I break my silence, the world will know who I am. Let us play now. \n21 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p25-26 \nLove burns the lover. \nDevotion burns the beloved. \nLove seeks happiness for the beloved. \nDevotion seeks blessings from the beloved. \nLove seeks to shoulder the burden of the beloved. \nDevotion throws the burden on the beloved. \nLove gives. \nDevotion asks. \nLove is silent and sublime, devoid of outward expression. \nDevotion expresses itself outwardly. \nLove does not require the presence of the beloved in order to love. \nDevotion demands the presence of the beloved to express affection for the beloved. \n1958? India? \nFrom a printed calendar \nOther versions: GM p313-314, PL p84 \nA man loves a woman who is living in a distant place. His love causes him to be thinking of \nher all the time, and he cannot eat, and he cannot sleep. His thoughts are only on his \nseparation from her, and he continually longs for her. \nWhen this longing becomes too great, he either goes to her, or he compels her to come to \nhim. This is called Ishk-e-Mijazi, or physical love. \nTo love God, one should think of God, long for God, and suffer the fire of separation, until \none's longing reaches its utmost limits, and God the beloved comes to the lover, and his \nthirst is quenched in union with God. This love is called Ishk-e-Haqqiqi, and is a gift from \nGod. \nBut one who obeys the Master who is one with God need not suffer these things, for in \nobedience is the grace of the Master. \nc.1960? EN p6 \nUnless there is a brotherly feeling in your hearts, all the words that you speak or print in my \nname are hollow; all the miles that you travel in my cause are zero; all organisations for my \nwork are but an appearance of activity; all buildings to contain me are empty places; and all \nstatues that you make to embody me are of someone else. \nNovember 1962, \nPoona, \nLA p710 \nI am the ocean of love. I have only love to give, and all I want is love. \nGG6 p251 \nDon't try to bind my lovers with discipline and regulations. Let them have free scope and \nfree play. \nSuppose you want to write a love letter full of effusion to your beloved. Will you like your \nletters to pass through some old one in the house? \nLJ p2 \nGatherings and meetings in my name should be a channel for the expression of my love, and \nto give them any other importance is to misunderstand my cause. \nHM p238 \nMy love is your light. Let it shine in your home as it shines in your hearts. \nc.1967, India, \ncable to Lyn and Phyllis Ott, unpublished \nTo love me for what I may give you is not loving me at all. To sacrifice anything in my cause \nto gain something for yourself is like a blind man sacrificing his eyes for sight. \nI am the divine beloved, worthy of being loved because I am love.

That is, \nto die before death, which amounts to becoming one with God. \n'To fear' is not to be taken literally. To fear means to be in the state of one created, in spite \nof realising oneself as the creator, or God. This is the state of a normal-conscious Perfect \nMaster, which is more difficult to attain, and spiritually superior to that of a Majzoob - one \nwho remains eternally immersed in the ocean of divinity, intoxicated continuously. \n'To fill' means to fill the hearts of people with the wine of divine knowledge. \n'To do or make' is the highest possible attainment. It means to make others Perfect like \nyourself. To do for others what you have done for yourself. To make them like yourself in \nterms of power, knowledge, authority and duty. This is the most supreme state, the state of \nbeing a Perfect Master. \nThe meaning of my words is that it is better to be one with God than to lead a worldly life; \nbetter to return to normal consciousness after union with God than to remain divinely \nabsorbed; better to fill the hearts of others with divine love than to remain indifferent to \nhumanity; and better to make others one with God than merely to fill their hearts with love. \n24 February 1923, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p488-489 \nThe realisation of the Supreme Being (Paramatma) as our own self is the realisation of \nTruth. The universe is the outcome of imagination. Then why try to get a superficial \nknowledge of the imaginative universe, rather than acquire the knowledge of self (Truth)? \nWhat is knowledge? Knowledge means the experience of Paramatma (Dnyan) - the \nknowledge of the highest that our soul, which is everlasting, gets of the Supreme Being, i.e., \nSelf-realisation. \nWhat is the universal understanding? It is called Vishva Dnyan, or the knowledge of the \nuniverse with which one comes down after realisation of Paramatma (Dnyan), i.e. \nknowledge of God and the Nirvikalpa state. That is to say, knowledge equals experience plus \nuniversal understanding, or perfect knowledge of that experience. Meaning again that he \nwho acquires knowledge must necessarily acquire experience, and then again, he must have \na perfect knowledge of that experience. Otherwise, those who acquire experience and \nremain in that Nirvikalpa state (the state of Ananta Ananda or everlasting bliss) are called \nMajzoobs. Although they are all-knowing and perfect in every way, they are unable to do \nanything for, or give salvation to, the world. \nIn short, the experience of the state of the Supreme Being (God) is the real state. \nNow let us see what this experience is that one gets before acquiring the real knowledge. \nThe Sadgurus or Realised ones take those to whom they are to give this experience through \nthe seven planes absolutely in the dark - either with bandages around their eyes, or with \ntheir eyes closed. That is, those to whom the Sadguru gives the experience have no \nknowledge of these seven planes. They are quite ignorant of that knowledge, though they \nhave already crossed all these seven planes. \nIt is for this reason that when the candidate for this experience is let off by the Sadguru just \nbelow the seventh plane, his state is unimaginable and indescribable. It is as if an \nunexpected current of millions of candlepower of electric light enters or dissolves his Subtle \nbody. He is amazed and stupefied at this new experience. \nThen, before he can properly think of his new, unimaginably wonderful experience, he \nsuddenly acquires the Nirvikalpa state, where he himself becomes one with the Ananta \nAnanda or eternal bliss. \nBut it is useless to realise all this without personal experience. One may listen to years of \nexplanations, or read volume after volume, but one would not get even a glimpse of an idea - \na shadow of a shadow - of the real experience, without experiencing it personally. \nSuch a perfect state is attained by one out of millions, and that too, only by the grace of a \nSadguru. To talk about this knowledge and experience without acquiring it - to realise it \nonly through philosophy or the superficial knowledge of religion - is utter folly - humbug, \npure and simple. \n29 April 1926, \nMeherabad, \nAw 16:1 p3-4 \nThe easiest and shortest way to God-realisation is through the contact of a Sadguru, which \nmeans keeping the company or sahavas of such a Master, obeying him and serving him. This \nremedy is like a special express train which carries you straight to your destination. \nThe second way is to repeat, with all love and in all sincerity, any one name of God, and in \nthe absence of a Sadguru, to serve humanity selflessly. This is like a journey by a passenger \ntrain, which halts at almost every station. \nThe third method takes a very long time. It means performing all the rites and ceremonies \nof one's religion wholeheartedly and faithfully, but not mechanically. This method is like a \nfreight train chugging along very slowly. \nThe Avatars and Perfect Masters carry their special disciples with them by express trains. \nTo those individuals who are inclined toward devotion and service, the Masters have shown \nthe path of selfless service and repetition of God's name. And for the world at large, they \nhave pointed to the path of observing rituals and ceremonies. \n31 May 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p806 \nUpasani Maharaj was a woman in his previous birth, and he will never take birth again. \nGod-realisation is usually obtained while living in a human form, as with the human form \ncomes authority. But there is a special authority that comes with the male human form. \nA Perfect Master has a Circle of twelve men and two female appendages. Of the fourteen \npeople, all the members of the Circle are males, except the two women, who play the roles \nof spiritual mother and sister. \nBabajan is a Qutub, one of the five of this age. From the fifty-six God-realised people, one \nwoman becomes a Perfect Master, and another is also Perfect -- a Jivanmukta or Majzoob. \nThat woman is presently in Tibet. She has a group of disiples, but usually stays in the \nmountains, and very, very few ever see her. \nThe remaining fifty-four God-realised beings are men. \nThe number of God-realised souls on Earth is eternally fixed at fifty-six, and is never altered, \nexcept during Avataric ages, when God directly descends as a man. \nJune 1926? \nLM3 p815 \nIt is not clear whether Baba was saying that there are always two Realised women living on \nEarth, or that just at that time (1926?) there were two Realised women incarnate. I think \nthe latter is more likely. Later, in the 1950s, Baba said that Upasani Maharaj would take \nanother birth in the future, even though he was a Perfect Master in this one. \nEditor \nA Sadguru is like an ocean, a limitless stretch of water. Empty your mind of all mayavic \ndesires, and the waters of the ocean will find a way in - the waters of knowledge, power and \nbliss. \nThe Jivanmuktas and Majzoobs and other spiritual beings on the Subtle and Mental planes \nare the pipelines for the waters of Realisation. They distribute the ocean's waters to \ndeserving candidates who are prepared and who are being prepared. \n22 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p816 \nThese Realised personalities are of two kinds: Saliks or Sadgurus, and Majzoobs or Brahmi-\nbhoots. Both are Realised and enjoy perfect bliss. But outwardly there is a vast difference \nbetween these two types. The Majzoobs, though God-realised, go about in rags or are \ncompletely naked. They remain in dirty surroundings, and are oblivious of the world and of \npeople, to whom they appear to be crazed beggars. On the other hand, Saliks and Sadgurus, \nthough fully God-realised, act just like ordinary mortals. They eat, drink, sleep, talk and \nappear to suffer like any other ordinary man. \nBut how can you recognise them? Among a hundred thousand so-called saints, there may be \nonly one who is real. What is the test? The best test is his company. Maintain your \nconnection with him, stay with him. Then you can know him, and even, in your own limited \nway, judge him by your standards, understanding him to some degree. For example, there \nare two glasses full of water. One glass contains a little salt in it. But how can you know \nwhich is which? For that, you have to taste the water, and only then are you able to know \nthe difference. Similarly, by keeping the close company of a so-called saint or Master, you \nwill come to know who is real and who is false. \n21 August 1929, \nDhulia, \nLM4 p1202-1203 \nLove and self-surrender both lead one to the goal. But generally in the path of love, one \ndrops his body after reaching the final destination. Whereas the one who treads the path of \nsurrender, besides becoming conscious of God, also becomes conscious of the three spheres, \nGross, Subtle and Mental, and thus returns to gross consciousness to serve as a beacon of \nlight to others on the Path. That is why surrendering is better than love. \nA Majzoob has no other consciousness except of God - no Gross, Subtle or Mental \nconsciousness. He is fully and divinely absorbed. After gaining normal consciousness, \nhowever, one can become conscious of the Gross, Subtle and Mental planes. Because of this, \nthe Qutubs are able to lead others on the Path and make them like themselves... Alongside \ntheir state of divinity, the Perfect Masters remain in the dirt of the world, the ocean of life. \nThey work in the maya of the illusory world, though this dirt does not touch them. On the \ncontrary, they lift others from the world and purify them. Therefore, surrender to a Perfect \nMaster is the best method of treading the Path, and there is no better way than that for \nreaching the objective, God-realisation. \nFebruary 18 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1269 \nTo lead men and women to the heights of Realisation, we must help them to overcome fear \nand greed, anger and passion. These are the result of looking upon the self as a limited, \nseparate physical entity, having a definite physical beginning and a definite physical end, \nwith interests apart from the rest of life, and needing preservation and protection. \nThe self in fact is a limitless, indivisible spiritual essence, eternal in its nature and infinite in \nits resources. The greatest romance possible in life is to discover this eternal reality in the \nmidst of infinite change. \nOnce one has experienced this, one sees oneself in everything that lives, one recognises all \nof life as his life, everybody's interests as his own. The fear of death, the desire for self-\npreservation, the urge to accumulate substance, the conflict of interests, the anger of \nthwarted desires, are gone. One is no longer bound by the habits of the past, no longer \nswayed by the hopes of the future. One lives in and enjoys each present moment to the full. \nThere is no greater romance in life than this adventure in Realisation. \n1 June 1932, \nBeverly Hills, California, \nMe p100-101 \nThere are many who have delusions of having realised God. After reading Vedanta and Sufi \nliterature, many genuinely believe that they have attained the state of Aham Brahmasmi or \nAnal Haq, the I-am-God state. \nNevertheless, such delusions are far better and more tolerable than the established \nassumptions of mankind that this world and its affairs are everlasting and real. \nWhat I say is that it is far better to be led into believing that 'I am not other than \nParamatma' than to get established in believing that 'I am only a speck of dust, I am a sinner, \nand I am weak.' \n1 November 1932, \nLM5 p1735 \nThe shortest and easiest way toward God-realisation is that of the seeker who has the good \nfortune to be accepted as a disciple by a Perfect Master. Only a Perfect Master, who is the \nveritable incarnation of divinity, can awaken in the individual the fire of divine love, which \nconsumes in its flames the lesser desires of body, mind and world, all of which must be \ncompletely relinquished before Perfection can be realised. The only requirement is \ncomplete surrender to his supreme will, perseverance, love, courage and trust in him. \n... The ego persists till the last stage of the Path or gnosis. Not until the seventh stage of the \nPath is reached, and God-consciousness is achieved, can the ego be completely transmuted \nfrom finite to infinite. It is only in this stage that the false I (individual ego) disappears for \ngood, and the real I appears for all time. This is the state of Christ-consciousness, to which \nJesus referred when he said, 'I and my Father are one,' and which implies living \nsimultaneously in the infinite and in the finite. \nc. 1930 Si p27 \nIt is never presumptuous for anyone to hope for Realisation. It is the goal of creation and the \nbirthright of humanity. \nBlessed are they who are prepared to assert that right in this very life. \n1936, India, \nto Garrett Fort, \nTr p194, also A p26 \nAll illusion comes and goes, but the soul remains unchanged. What is meant by God-\nrealisation is to actually experience this important thing - that the soul is eternal. \nDecember 1936, \nNasik, \nLA p157 \nImagine your being everything, these pillars, walls, everything. You are, but you cannot \nunderstand. Why? Because the mind is there. Realisation means being fully awake in the \nsound-sleep state. In sound sleep there is no mind, no consciousness. You don't see \nanything, not even dreams of the subconscious. You don't hear, see, or feel. \nBut self exists and there is consciousness also. It is just like the sound-sleep state. The only \ndifference is that you are conscious of it. \nDecember 1936, \nNasik, \nLA p158 \nHow to explain what happens when you become God-realised? No more body, mind, ego, no \nmore universe, only you as God experiencing bliss. You then experience knowledge too, \npower too, but you do not use power. You are one with this power, this knowledge, this \nbliss. When you come down for the world, you take on a universal mind. Now, as God, you \nsee all souls as your own. You see yourself in everything, and your universal mind has all \nminds in it, as one mind. \nWhat every mind suffers comes into your mind. Your mind suffers the suffering of all minds, \nand experiences the happiness of all minds. But as ignorance exists in all minds, the \nsuffering is infinitely more than the happiness of those minds. Therefore, you suffer \ninfinitely. However, your soul, which is fully conscious and enjoys God's bliss continually, \nand which is also enjoying its infinite state, is not affected by this suffering. \nNow you, as soul in your present state, are unconscious of God and God's bliss. Your mind \nnow suffers or is happy according to your impressions. Soul, as it were, is not affected, \nbecause through ignorance your soul is identified with your mind. After attaining \nknowledge, your soul consciously experiences God's bliss. If you come down, your mind \nthen experiences suffering or happiness, but soul is not affected. You are soul. When your \nmission is complete, the universal mind goes, and with it universal suffering goes. Then soul \nenjoys God's bliss eternally. \n19 September 1938, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2318 \nMost God-realised souls leave the body at once and forever, and remain eternally merged in \nthe unmanifest aspect of God. They are conscious only of the bliss of union. Creation no \nlonger exists for them. Their constant round of births and deaths is ended. This is known as \nMukti or Liberation. \nSome God-realised souls retain the body for a time, but their consciousness is merged \ncompletely in the unmanifest aspect of God, and they are therefore not conscious either of \ntheir bodies or of creation. They experience constantly the infinite bliss, power and \nknowledge of God, but they cannot consciously use them in creation, or help others to attain \nto Liberation. \nNevertheless, their presence on earth is like a focal point for the concentration and \nradiation of the infinite power, knowledge and bliss of God. And those who approach them, \nserve them and worship them are spiritually benefited by contact with them. These souls \nare called Majzoobs, and this particular type of Liberation is called Videh-Mukti, or \nLiberation with the body. \nc.1939, Di v1 p 2-3 \nEssentially, we are all one. I am greater than none of you in the soul sense, and, really \nspeaking, none of you have to receive divinity from me - the divinity that is eternally \nexisting equally in us all. But what I have to give is the knowledge and the experience of the \noneness of us all. \n11 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p65-66 \nFrom the point of view of the highest and the only Truth, God alone is real, and is one \neternal, indivisible and unlimited being, which may, for the purposes of intellectual \nunderstanding, be described as an infinite ocean of love, bliss and understanding. \nThe realisation of God as he is necessarily requires the complete surrenderance of the false \nindividuality of the separate I. All separateness and duality is only illusion. And this illusion \nis sustained by the sanskaras (impressions) of the ego-life, which expresses itself through \nlust, hate and greed. \nBut through the pure life of selfless love and service, and through the grace of a God-realised \nMaster, it is possible to brush away these limiting sanskaras, and by transcending the \nillusory veil of separateness, to know oneself to be identical with God, which is the sole \nreality. This God-realisation, which comes on the seventh plane of consciousness, is the goal \nof all life. It is the final reason why the entire universe came into existence. \nGod-realisation is sometimes mistakenly thought to be a selfish purpose of the limited \nindividual. There is no room for any selfishness or limited individuality in God-realisation. \nOn the contrary, God-realisation is the final aim of the limited and narrow life of the \nseparate ego. \nIt not only consists in the attainment by the individual of an inviolable unity with all life, but \nit also dynamically expresses this final realisation of the Truth through a spontaneous and \nundivided life of love, peace and harmony. The life of the God-realised Master is a pure \nblessing to all humanity. \n12 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p67-68 \nThe gateway to this highest state of being one with God is firmly closed for all who do not \nhave the courage to lose their separate existence in the restless fire of divine love. \nI give my blessings to all who are thirsting for the full realisation of divinity, for they shall be \nthe pillars of the coming era of truth and love. \n12 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p70 \nNo one can realise God except through the grace and help of a God-realised Master, who is \nTruth incarnate. Only a God-realised Master can awaken this true love in the human heart, \nby consuming, through the fire of his grace, all the dross that prevents its release. \nThose who have got the courage and the wisdom to surrender themselves to a Perfect \nMaster are the recipients of his grace. The grace of the Master does come to those who \ndeserve it, and when it comes, it enkindles in the human heart a love divine, which not only \nenables the aspirant to become one with God, but also to be of infinite help to others, who \nare also struggling with their own limitations. There is no power greater than love. \n14 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p73 \nThe life in eternity knows no bondage, decay or sorrow, and it is the everlasting and ever-\nrenewing self-affirmation of conscious and illimitable divinity. The clouds of sanskaras have \nto disappear completely before the sky of consciousness is illumined by the \ninextinguishable light of God, who is the real self of all. \nMy mission is to help you to inherit this hidden treasure of the self; and all who earnestly \nseek it have my blessings. \n16 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p80 \nA young man named Keith McGaffney asked Baba 'what was all this stuff about God-\nrealisation?' \nBaba: It's like a headache. Until you have a headache yourself, you can't understand what it \nis like. \nJuly 1952, \nNew York, \nAw 14:2 p19 \nWhen a person becomes God-realised, he drops the body in one to three days. \nOnly a very few keep the body, but they are unaware of the creation. They become \nMajzoobs. \nA very few - and these are decided by God - keep the body, and are also fully God-conscious \nand world-conscious. They become the Perfect Masters. But that is by God's will. \nJuly 1952, \nNew York \nAw 14:2 p20 \nGod is eternally free. To realise God is to attain liberation from the bondage of illusion. \n1954, \nAndhra, \nMD p8 \nWe are already in possession of infinite power and happiness. But it is our way of life which \nprevents us from enjoying these eternal treasures of God. \n1954, \nAndhra, \nMD p12 \nAs long as you remain separated from God and try to understand him, he cannot be \nunderstood. There is no separation between you and God. Lover and beloved are one. You, \nyourself are the way. You are God. \n1954, \nAndhra, \nMD p14 \nThe happiness of God-realisation is the goal of all creation. The real happiness which comes \nthrough realising God is worth all physical and mental sufferings in the universe. Then all \nsuffering is as if it were not. \nThe happiness of God-realisation is self-sustained, eternally fresh and unfailing, boundless \nand indescribable. And it is for this happiness that the world has sprung into existence. \nbefore 1955, GS p139 \nThe Mental-conscious soul, even while retaining a Gross body, remains stationed on its \nhigher planes, without getting entangled even with the Subtle planes. It keeps waiting till it \nmerges with God or Truth in the seventh plane. \nAfter merger, the soul may remain immersed in the bliss of God-realisation and become a \nMajzoob, or come down to the lower planes of duality for work (without losing its \nRealisation of the unitary Truth) and become a Perfect Master. \nWhether a particular God-realised soul becomes Majzoob or a Perfect Master is a matter \ndecided by the initial urge in creation. These varieties of terminal states are not subject to \nsanskaric or impressional determination. In both terminal states there is not trace of any \nbinding impressions. However, the entire fabric of the universe serves but one purpose, viz. \nrealisation of God. \n1955? Be p17 \nQ. Has not the God-realised one an ego? \nBaba: He has. But the ego of the God-realised one is altogether different. When you say, 'I am \nso-and-so,' it is the false ego asserting the false self. When you become God-merged ( a \nPerfect Majzoob or Brahmi-bhoot), you have no mind, and you are conscious only of being \nGod. This is the state of superconsciousness. But when, retaining that state, you come down \nto normal consciousness, you have ego, and it is the real ego. \n1960, Poona, DH p52 \nIt is in God's plan to awaken everyone from the dream of creation, and make him live in him \nand experience his infinite bliss. \n1960, Poona, DH p52 \nThe God-realised soul lives in the world, but the world does not and cannot touch him. But \nto achieve God-realisation is not child's play. For this, one has to surrender all, body, mind \nand heart, to the Perfect Master... \nThe intensity of longing necessary for becoming one with God can never be measured, \nhowever high the Gross standard. Such longing is a rare experience, altogether unique, and \nit is exclusively for the one who is ablaze with a spark of divine love from the Perfect \nMaster. \n1960, Poona, DH p69, 71 \nThe journey seems infinitely long while you are passing through the dream-experiences of \nreincarnation and the six planes of involution, until finally you merge into yourself, to \nemerge as self. But the journey is after all no journey. It is simply the momentum of your \nurge to awaken from the dream, and get established in the reality of the God-state of infinite \nconsciousness. \nTo awaken means to consciously experience the sound-sleep state of God. When you awake \nyou find that the great dream, containing all the varied illusory aspects of dreaming, has \nvanished forever. Heaven and hell, as well as all the planes, vanish within yourself, to \nremain as nothing. In this awakened state, there is no scope for anything besides you, the \nself, the existence eternal and infinite. \nThis is the only experience worth experiencing and aspiring after. To gain this experience, \nyou have to become as dust at the feet of the Perfect Master, which amounts to becoming as \nnothing. And when you become absolutely nothing, you become everything. \nc.1961, India, EN p11-12 \nThe direct knowledge of God is that knowledge (dnyan) had through the experience of \nbecoming one with God, and can only be had by the grace of the Perfect Master. But indirect \nknowledge, such as that obtained through descriptions and pictures, is information for the \nmind only. \nTo know reality is to become it. It is nearest to you, for in fact, it is you. Owing to ignorance, \nGod, who is nearest, appears to be farthest. But when the veil of ignorance is rent by the \ngrace of the Perfect Master, you become you, the real self, which is the innermost reality \nthat you are, ever were and ever will be. \nc.1961, India, EN p36 \nI am infinite knowledge, power and bliss. I can make anyone realise God if I choose to do so. \nYou may ask, 'Why not make me realise God now?' But why should it be you? Why not the \nperson next to you, or the man in the street, or that bird on the tree, or that stone -- who are \nall one in different forms? \nThe more you love me, the sooner you will discard the falsehood you have chosen to hide \nunder, that hoodwinks you into believing you are what you are not. \nI am in all and love all equally. Your love for me will wear through your falseness, and make \nyou realise the self that you truly are. \nc.1961, India, EN p50 \nThe experience of both imprisonment and release is of illusion. But the experience of the \nfinal freedom is of reality. The emancipated soul then experiences continuously and \neternally its own infinite freedom. \nThe world exists only as long as the soul experiences bondage. When the soul realises itself \nas reality, the world vanishes, for it never was. And the soul experiences itself as being \ninfinite and eternal. \nc.1961, India, EN p99 \nAfter Realisation some persons may live only for a few days. Most humans drop the body \nafter three days. Some live a few weeks, a few months, a few years or many years. \nSome human beings are God-realised at a young age -- Dnyaneshwar was 8, the youngest \nSadguru ever, but only lived to 18 -- or at a mature age, or at a very old age.

This meant leaving our families or careers, and a promise to obey Baba \nimplicitly. Although Baba said we would be at the Nasik ashram for up to five years, before \nleaving I had written to Baba for the English group, expressing our concern that he would \nsend us back to the West after a short stay with him in India, as he had done previously. \nWhat was Baba's reply?' \nRahuri \nNovember 26, 1936 \nDarling Saroja, \n... I feel so disappointed that with all their love for me, Kimco wouldn't understand in spite \nof explanations of some important things so clearly given... \nI was so happy you all eventually agreed to come, but the peculiar attitude of Kimco, always \nso typical, of taking all things -- however serious -- so lightly, even if I want them to take it \nseriously and understand, at times causes me great pain... \nYour heart is so wonderful, always feeling so deeply and truly, and responsive to the call \nand understanding, but the peculiar mind of yours at times wobbles and tries to shake your \nfaith, and your love revives it all again and afresh. \nOne moment you feel quite prepared to do and stand anything. The next moment you \nhesitate with ifs and buts, and feel depressed and worried unnecessarily. \nBut I will see that this eternal struggle between the head and the heart, for you as well as for \nall others who suffer from the same weakness, ends eventually in the victory of the heart \nover the head, and brings about a blending of the two. \nIn fact, I am working at it, suffering myself almost all the while of being misunderstood \nevery moment, and in every act of compassion in raising the consciousness and \nunderstanding of humanity to a higher level, even by my own, who have known me, and \nhave been in my closer contact! \nJust a little individual effort to understand and do as I say, and it would save so much \ntrouble and pains for me and for all. \nMy love to all and self, \nM. S. Irani \nsource: LA p142 \nAnother version: LM6 p2052 \nPart of a letter to Garrett Fort from Meher Baba \ndated 3 October 1937, Cannes, France \nNow you know that your earning power, like all your talents, is a grace from me, given or \nwithheld as I deem best for your spiritual evolution. \nYou said in your letter that you have surrendered your life to me, that you have no ambition \nbut to serve me, that you are a soldier ready for the call. But apparently you do not like the \ncall that has been given you. You want the war to be conducted according to your ideas, not \nmine. \nTry to remember, dear Garrett, that you are doing my work, which is as ancient as I am. In \nsurrendering your life to me, you must be prepared to follow my instructions implicitly, \nwithout caring for the results, which are in my hands and depend upon my will. My \npromises are always kept, but in my own way and at my own time. \nI am not a writer, so I do not always express myself as well as you might wish. I am not a \npedagogue, so I do not tell you in advance what the lesson for tomorrow will be. I am God, \nthe Supreme Liberator, and if you knew what strides you have been making toward \nLiberation by the trials through which you have been going since you left me, you would be \novercome with gratitude, instead of filled with discontent. \nIt is true, I use the circumstances of everyday life to Liberate my devotees, but I use them in \na way that is beyond the comprehension of the intellect. So you must not expect me to \nprovide you with blueprints of my plans, either individual or universal. Have faith in me, \nsupreme faith. I am always with you, directing you as my own vehicle, my own son. \nWhatever is accomplished in all that you do or do not do is always my will! \nYou are an instrument in my divine orchestra, an instrument which I need, but which must \nbe Perfected. I shall never fail you, nor will you fail me. You must continue to be brave as \nyou have been. \nLM6 p2141 \nFor more about Garrett Fort, see LM6 p2130-2141 \n\"It's a fantasy. I have been with him for forty years. There is no such thing as spiritual \nprogress. \n\"Hold onto him. Him moving about is the progress. \n\"The cardinal things he has said, hold onto them: \nHold onto my daaman. \nRemember that I love you, so that you can reflect my love. \nBe loving towards all. \nBe honest, simple, natural, childlike. \n\"That's all, that's all we have to do. That is our path, no more than that. That is our \nspirituality. Everything is in holding on to him. There's nothing beyond it... \n\"... True spirituality is total effacement, without giving a thought that we are treading, or \nthat this is my spiritual progress, and this is how I take the next step, and this step and that \nstep. \n\"But then, how will there be total effacement? The practical way is, hold on to him, be \nsimple, be natural - that is effacing yourself. But if just one word is used - effacement - that \ndoesn't convey anything, you see. What do you mean, effacement? Should we get ourselves \nrolled upon by a steamroller or something like that? No. It's a wearing ourselves out by \nholding onto him. It's very difficult. It sounds so simple - mmm - very difficult... \n\"We have nothing to do with the Path. Wherever we are, that becomes the Path. If you turn \naway from him, the Path also follows you there. Then again he gives you another turn \ntowards him - the Path again follows. He is there. He is the pivot. \n\"As long as the concentration on him is there, there is no such thing as Path. What happens \nis that our focus is on the beloved himself. We have nothing to do with the Path. If Path is \nthere at all, Path will follow us, because we are heading towards him. We have no time to \nsee to the Path at all - we are all the time focusing upon him. \n\"That is the greatness of those who come in the orbit of his love. The Path follows him, \nwhereas, for other wayfarers, they have to follow the Path. \n\"We don't follow the Path, because we have got the beloved. We have direct contact with \nhim, so our energies, our might, our soul, our being, our bodies are all focused upon him. So \nthat is the difference between the lover of the God-man and the lover of the Path. \n\"But then there will come a state (for the lover of the Path) when again he will be there. He \ncomes to that place where he focuses on the beloved only. Then the Path disappears for him. \n\"But the spiritual dispensation is there to dispense with the Path. He brings the destination \nin our midst. You follow? What need is there for the Path when the destination is there? Ah, \nmy language falls short, but this is how it is. I hope I can give you the idea that is behind it. \nNo tantalising effects are there for us, you see... \nPath is created by us, you see. But one who is concentrating all his thought and devotion, his \nheart and his consciousness, his everything upon him, for him there is no Path, whether you \nare in involution or evolution, or whatever process is there. He even discards the very \nconcept of Realisation. \nQ. Does the idea of involution apply to us, then? \nEruch: There is involution, it is all there, the Path is there, you see. \nQ. But without the experience of it. \nEruch: Yes, without. It's all there, but you don't experience it. Just as he has used the word, \nyou are led 'blindfolded.' You follow? And that blindfolding is not just mechanical \nblindfolding, because - words fail here. You may call it your heart is set upon him, your \nwhole focus of consciousness is upon him. Whatever you call it, it is just on him. He becomes \nthe Path, the way and the goal. \nQ. You're inattentive to the Path so profoundly that it doesn't exist for you. \nEruch: Doesn't exist - although it is there. The powers are there on the Path, you see. Many \nenchantments are there. All the powers are confronting you, they are just prostrating before \nyou: 'Use me, I am here.' But you, you discard all this. Your attention is always on him. Your \nheart is set upon him: when will I go, when will I see him, when will I be with him, when will \nI be in his company? You don't take any cognisance of this. They don't exist for you, really \nspeaking, let alone don't care. You don't even notice that they are all there. It is so, it's a fact. \nSo that's why the greatest spiritual dispensation is his being in our midst. \nEruch Jessawala, 30 November and 3 December 1978, \nMeherazad, from tape recordings, Aw 19:2 p55-56 \n\"So often Baba told us by his illimitable hand gestures, or perhaps in a treasured letter or \ncable, 'Remember - I am always with you.' \n\"Naturally, it was a phrase that stirred up feelings of love, trust and hope - he is always with \nus. But what does it mean? Especially now that his physical presence is gone? Those who \nmet him, and those who did not, are 'sailing in the same boat now,' as the Song of the New \nLife so aptly puts it. No longer are there cables, letters, messages, circulars from India. \n\"One thing is clear: each one of us has to follow him inwardly. We have to seek his inner \nguidance. \n\"What form will it take? I think it will differ for each of us. I think Baba will work with each \nindividual differently just as he did when in the body. He is the master counselor, friend, \npsychologist. He understands our temperament as well as our needs. \n\"His presence will be 'not in the flesh but in the spirit,' as St. John says. The New Testament \ncalls this inner presence the Holy Comforter - the third part of the Trinity - the Holy Ghost. \n('Ghost' is a strange translation of the Latin 'spiritus.') The essence is the same but each one \nfeels it in a different way. \n\"Some feel it as an actual presence, touch, glance, even image. Others feel it as an \noverwhelming sense of love. Some get 'hints' by the way things happen around them, to \nthem, for them, showing the Master's love and care. A few may actually see or hear him. \nSome contact him in significant dreams. Some feel his love coming to them from others, or \nthey feel it in the way their own heart sprouts love. Many times it happens in communion, in \ngroups. Did not Baba, like Jesus, say that where two or more are gathered together, there he \nwould be? His sahavas is the give and take of love, and love flows always from heart to \nheart. \n\"Most important, what are we going to do to rate his inner guidance? Why is it so often \nblocked? What are we doing so that we don't feel his presence, which he says is always \nthere? The answer is simple, though no one likes to hear it. We are in the way. We cast the \nshadow. Above all, our negative emotions shut off the communion. Fear, hate, greed, need, \nanger, depression, sometimes too much pain or loss, shut him out. \n\"The only remedy is not to cling to these negative emotions, but to cast them at his feet. \nSuch feelings will come, must come, but we have to surrender them to him... trust him to \ndeal with them. Doubt is the worst. Baba says the mind always doubts, but not the heart. It \nis all a test... this seeking for his guidance through our own valley of shadows. \n\"But intelligence and reason are not to be thrust aside. We must use discrimination. We \nmust evaluate what we think is his guidance. Not every dream, not every vision, not every \n'Baba coincidence' is true. The possibility of self-delusion is always there. That is why Baba \nsays we must balance head and heart. \n\"What breaks this dilemma? Sincere prayer. Sincere prayer for his guidance, and the faith \nthat he will respond. Baba said, after all, that his position is so high that he must respond to \nthe call of his devotee, no matter where or when. That is what discipleship is all about. Baba \nnever said to follow him is easy, but the reward is the greatest - our way out of Maya.\" \nFilis Frederick, Aw 22:1 p30  (before August 1985) \nFollowing Meher Baba Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "HAPPINESS \nMeher Baba \nBe mentally free and happy. As is the cause, so is the effect. The cause may be big and \nimportant, or small and insignificant. But the result will definitely be according to the cause. \nThe woes of this world are imaginary, and are the self-created result of our own ignorance. \nHaving no cause, they are therefore unjustifiable. If there is no reason or cause, then it \nnaturally follows that the result is unreal, insubstantial and meaningless. \nSo why worry about the happiness or misery of this world, which has no cause behind it \nexcept imagination? Just go on observing things as a passive spectator as they go on around \nyou, keeping the mind free and happy. As Hafez says, \n'Both the happiness and sorrows of this world will pass away, \nso it is better to always remain peaceful.\"' \nMeher Baba, \nOctober 1922, \nBombay, \nLM2 p439-440 \n\"If you realised but a particle of that knowledge which I know, you would experience \ninexpressible bliss. Every object would impart happiness to you. Every object would tell you \nits part in the story of knowledge, and all the misery that's in the world would shine forth as \nheaven.\" \nMeher Baba, \nMay? 1924, \nHappy Valley, \nSW p204 \nA man who came to meet Meher Baba said he was addicted to drugs. \nBaba: Are you happy? \nMan: No, very, very miserable. \nBaba: Try to be always happy. Never think that life is dreadful, 'I am tired of life.' Such \nthoughts really make life miserable. Life is worth living. If you think like that, all difficulties \nwill appear insignificant. \nI will help you to try to develop love. Never think, 'I am alone,' 'I have so much to do,' 'I am \npoor,' and so on. All are poor. The whole world is poor. Even the millionaires are poor, \nbecause they have greed and want more. Love someone, and I will help you.* Do not worry. \nMy blessings. \n1930s, Europe? A p2 \nAnother version: PM p249 \n*In another version of this interview, Baba is quoted as saying (on the alphabet board): \n\"Love someone, and you will be rich.\" \n(PM p249) \nQ. Oh, I am so happy to see you... I am so tired of life, and very unhappy... don't see how I can \nimprove. \nBaba: Everyone is unconsciously tired of this life, because everyone seeks happiness, but \nknows not how to get it. But life is so beautiful. It is meant to be happy. \nI will help you. Then things will appear changed. You will see it. \nIt is always the outlook that counts, and not the object. Today you feel tired, upset, seeing \nnothing beautiful in things round you in life. If tomorrow you do not feel bored but cheerful, \nin the same things that appeared so black to you yesterday... it is all due to changed \nmentality and outlook. \nThe easy way is not to make much of things. Take them lightly. Say to yourself, \nI am meant to be happy, to make others happy. \nAnd gradually you do become happy yourself, and make others too. Don't suggest to your \nmind, 'I am tired, haggard, depressed.' That will make you feel worse. Always say, \nAll is well and beautiful. I will be happy. \nI will help you spiritually. I can and I will. You will feel it. \n1930s, Europe? A p13 \nQ. How can I have happiness? \nBaba: Everyone in the world, consciously or unconsciously, seeks happiness in one form or \nanother.  You seek it now in your own way. Even a murderer seeks happiness, which he \nhopes to find in the very act of murder, and that is why he commits it. \nWhy or when does a man commit murder? Either through hatred or jealousy. And because \nhe thinks he will find happiness if he commits murder, and takes his revenge for hatred or \njealousy. \nAgain, why does a man commit suicide? Because he expects to find happiness in it. \nWhy does a man drink? Because of the happiness he expects to derive from the drink. But \nwhat happiness does he derive (from the drink) and how long does it last? Only as long as \nthe effect of the intoxication lasts. No sooner it cools down, he feels broken, dejected and \nmiserable. It is the same case with lust and lusty actions. One does it all for the happiness \none derives, even for a moment. \nBut it is all for the time being that one derives happiness from one action or another, and \nwhen it is over, he is miserable again. Real happiness is quite different. It never changes nor \nceases. It is permanent, everlasting, and it lies there, there within you. It is sleeping - latent, \nand must be opened - unlocked. Once it is opened, it is always happiness. \nI am the source of happiness, the sun of all bliss. But there is a cover, a curtain, that veils you \nfrom the sun, and you do not see it. Now, because of your inability to see owing to a curtain, \nyou cannot say there is no sun. The sun is there, shining and spreading its lustre all over the \nworld. But you do not allow its rays to approach you, obstructing them with the veil of \nignorance. Remove that, and you will see the sun. \nI will help you to tear open the curtain, and enable you to find happiness within. I love you. I \nlove all. \nPart of an interview, \n1930s, Europe? \nA p30-31 \nEverything that people do in the world is done to obtain happiness. People seek power to \nderive happiness. They strive after money wishing to find happiness through possessions. \nThis is all right when money is used rightly, but it leads to misery and unhappiness when \nbad use is made of it. \nScience also seeks to promote happiness. Inventions are made for the happiness of others, \nand can be so, if used rightly. But when used for the wrong purposes, they lead only to \ngreater unhappiness and misery. For example, if airplanes are put to use for war, they bring \ndeath and destruction. \nSo what matters is happiness, since everybody seeks to be happy. When we gain God, \npermanent happiness is gained. Happiness based on self-forgetfulness alone leads to \npermanent happiness - to God. When one loses the self in making others happy, one attains \nreal happiness, which is God. All other forms of happiness are fleeting and changeable. \nThis real happiness must be very strong to enable one to support all the suffering that \ncomes to one, or like that which I have to bear. \n24 July 1938, \nAhmednagar, \nLM7 p2297 \nInfinite bliss is bliss eternal and continual, and because it is perpetual, it is without any \nopposite aspects. Happiness, on the other hand, although linked with infinite bliss, is not \nperpetual, and therefore it has an opposite aspect of misery. \n1960s? India? \nEchoes: A Meher Baba Reader \n(1969) ed. \nNaosherwan Anzar, p11 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

Distributing a few to each of us, he asked \nif we liked the taste of it. With the exception of Arjun, all replied in the affirmative. After \nsome five minutes, Baba asked us if the taste of the chocolate that we enjoyed just a few \nminutes ago was still there. On getting an unanimous reply in the negative, he said, \n\"When a good thing is given to it, the mind is pleased, but soon after settles down to its \noriginal state. If some bitter medicine or a purgative, like epsom salts and castor oil, is \nforced upon it, the same mind revolts. But again, after a short while, it reverts to its normal \nstate. This proves that both the pleasures and pains of this world are so very ephemeral and \nshort-lived. \n\"Just now, you ate the chocolates with a sense of enjoyment, but immediately after, the same \nenjoyment and taste has become a thing of the past, since no result thereof has remained. \nSuch is the case with all the earthly pleasures and pains. The highest kind of enjoyment or \npleasurable sensation in this world is sexual intercourse. But how long does it last? Only a \nfew minutes. \n\"Now this, the highest of all the material pleasures, can well be compared with the real \nhappiness as if the former were a shadow of a drop from the infinite ocean of eternal \nhappiness, which when once realised is felt and enjoyed every second forever! From this \ncomparison, you can imagine the hollowness of the world and its pleasures.\" \nRamjoo Abdulla, 12 October 1922, \nBombay, RD p104-105 \nAnother version: LM2 p439 \n\"All Baba asked from each was a happy face and work done cheerfully. To Baba, this \ncheerfulness was a goal most worth striving for, a goal of paramount importance. Baba told \nus, \n\" 'If you don't want to be old before you really ought to be old, be cheerful in thought, word, \ndeed and appearance -- most of all in appearance. \nMaybe you are not happy inside, perhaps gas in your stomach. But you must look happy. I \nalways find half of you garlic-faced. When you eat garlic, it is a smell passed on to all. So \nwhen you appear garlic-faced, that too is contagious. \nIt is a divine art to always look cheerful, it is a divine quality. It helps others. When you are \ngarlic-faced, it makes others unhappy.' \n\"Baba emphasized that no one must expect to get happiness from others, but to be happy in \noneself.\" \nKitty Davy (late 1930s?)

And those souls who, after Liberation, return to normal \nconsciousness, have Universal minds. \n22 July 1925, \nMeherabad, \nGM p54 \nA swine generally lives on refuse-matter. Give it dainty edibles, but it will not even look at \nthem, much less eat them, if it has sufficient refuse matter to partake of. That is why it is \nsaid, 'Cast not pearls before swine.' Materialistic persons are like swine, for they prefer the \nfilth of the world to the pearl of Liberation from the chain of births and deaths. \nMs 1:6 p7-8 \n(June 1929) \nAnother version: Sa p28 \nThis new influx of the creative impulse takes, through the medium of a divine personality, \nan incarnation of God in a special sense - an Avatar. This Avatar was the first individual soul \nto emerge from the evolutionary process as a Sadguru, and he is the only Avatar who has \never manifested, or will ever manifest. Through him, God first completed the journey from \nunconscious divinity to conscious divinity, first unconsciously became man in order \nconsciously to become God. Through him, periodically, God consciously becomes man for \nthe Liberation of mankind. \n1938, India, \nMJ 1:1 p4-5 \nAnother version: \nDi (7th ed.) p269 \nThe Avatar awakens contemporary humanity to a realisation of its true spiritual nature, \ngives Liberation to those who are ready, and quickens the life of the spirit in his time. \n1938, India, \nMJ 1:1 p7 \nAnother version: \nDi (7th ed.) p269-270 \nMost God-realised souls leave the body at once and forever, and remain eternally merged in \nthe unmanifest aspect of God. They are conscious only of the bliss of union. Creation no \nlonger exists for them. Their constant round of births and deaths is ended. This is known as \nMukti or Liberation. \nc.1939, Di v1 p2 \nThose who die thinking of me come to me. They are Liberated from the chain of birth and \ndeath, and see me perpetually. \nMarch? 1939, LM7 p2409 \nAlthough I am the formless one, I am destined to assume a human form again and again, and \nso I am here. But I wish for you to become free from the wheel of births and deaths, of being \nborn again and again: growing, maturing, marrying, enjoying, procreating, decaying and \ndying. \nGod is just as soft as he is hard, as compassionate as he is harsh. Just remember that when \nyou call on him or invoke him, if he is touched even once, the impossible then becomes \npossible and you become free. \n2 November 1952, \nMeherabad, \nGG3 p133-134 \nGod is eternally free. To realise God is to attain Liberation from the bondage of illusion. \n1954, Andhra, MD p8 \nThe thought or wish the dying individual holds at the moment of death has special \nimportance in determining his future destiny. If the last thought is of God or the Master, the \nindividual achieves Liberation. \nIt is quite common for an individual not to have any specific thought at the moment of \ndeath. Even if he has had thoughts or wishes before death, he will tend to forget them at the \ntime of death. At that moment some people hope they may not return to earthly life, but \nthey are not exempted from rebirth by mere wishing. They are reborn, but exhibit a \npronounced disgust for life, and tend to lead the lives of ascetics or recluses... \nThe true death of the individual occurs at that moment when he transcends his limited \nindividuality or separative consciousness by being taken up in the Truth-consciousness of \nthe unlimited and undivided being of God. The true death of the individual consists in the \ncomplete disappearance  of  the  limiting  ego-mind  that has created the sanskaric veil of \nignorance. True death is a far more difficult process than physical death, but when it occurs, \nthrough the grace of the Master, it takes no longer than the twinkling of an eye. This \ndissolution of the ego-mind, and the freeing of the soul from the illusion of separative, \nlimited individuality, are known as Liberation. \nThe sanskara-ridden ego-mind can never attain any real poise. It vacillates in constant \nrhythm to the alternating dominant sanskaras. Consciousness can attain true poise only \nwhen the ego-mind, with all its attendant sanskaras, terminates. This is effected through the \nemergence of the unlimited and ultra-sanskaric individuality that comes into its own upon \nthe inheriting of conscious eternal existence, which is true immortality. \nThe infinite poise of consciousness in Realisation should not be confused with the \nsemblance of sanskaric equilibration that is approached by the limited ego-mind in \ndiscarnate life in the hell or heaven state. Such ineffable poise is unapproachable by the full \nconsciousness in man as long as it remains clouded by the slightest traces of the limiting \nego-mind. \nAt the time of taking on a new physical body, the good and the bad sanskaras of the \nindividual are almost in balance. However, there is always a slight ascendance at this time of \neither the good or bad sanskaras. They are never in perfect balance, nor do they in any \nmanner overlap or cancel one another. Complete poise can exist only when the two \nopposite classes of sanskaras are so qualitatively and quantitatively opposed that they \nexactly cancel one another. \nWhen opposite sanskaras are not only equal in strength, but are also in exact qualitative \nopposition, they cancel each other, and can no longer act as semi-automatic subjective \npropelling forces, but are transmuted into consummate understanding that is free from \nopposing reactions to life. This is the state of Liberation... \nTrue immortality is not the survival of the limited individual in the period following the \ndeath of the physical body. It is true that the ego-mind persists unscathed through death, \nbut the individual cannot and does not thereupon attain to final freedom from birth and \ndeath. Survival should not be confused with deathlessness, which is true immortality. The \nchain of alternating incarnate and discarnate life is only a survival of consciousness plus \nignorance, and ignorance makes true life impossible. \nLife in ignorance is the very negation of existence in Truth. It is so basic a curtailment of \ntrue existence that when judged by the standards of the true existence in eternity, it had \nbest be termed a continuous death. Only in Realisation is consciousness emancipated from \nthe tyranny of this continuous death which nullifies the true life in eternity. And only in \nLiberation can consciousness arrive at that true immortality which lies beyond all \ncurtailment and obscurity. \nbefore 1956, \nLH p104, 108-111 \nI am never sorry for anyone who dies. He who dies with my name on his lips, with me in his \nheart, never dies. I never worry about them, for theirs is no loss. If I am ever worried, it is \nfor those that suffer through the death, which they might allow to alienate them from me. \nThat would be their loss indeed. Why suffer unnecessarily? My dead live in me. That should \nmake you happy... \nKnowing this, any mourning you may do therefore must be for yourselves only, from selfish \nmotives. You don't know how fortunate they are who die with my name on their lips and in \ntheir hearts. \n1955, AL p94 \nFor ages past I have been telling people to leave all and come to me. That alone is the way to \nLiberation from all illusion. \n1955, Meherabad, LH p40 \nAlthough I am taking my own name continuously, I have come to hear it repeated by my \nlovers. And even though I were deaf, I would hear it if you repeated it only once with all \nyour heart in it. If you cannot remember me constantly, then always take my name before \ngoing to sleep and on waking up. At least remember to remember me when you breathe \nyour last, and you will still come to me. But how will you remember at the last moment, \nunless you start to remember me right now? \nKammu Baba, whom many revere as a saint in Bombay, recently sent me word asking to be \nrelieved of his duties and to return unto me. I advised him also to take my name when \nbreathing his last. In his last moments, Nozher took my name. So did my brother Jamshed, \nand many others who have come to me. But it is only the heroes who come to me in their \nphysical form. To these, death itself surrenders ultimately. \n1955, Meherabad, LH p45 \nNozher = Nozher Dadachanji. \nIn reality, there is nothing such as death or birth. I know this, and I say it with the authority \nof my conscious knowledge. We are all in eternity, and we will always be there. Really, none \ncomes or goes, none is born or dies. But to experience this truth, we must first free \nourselves from the bondage of our ignorance. \nAfter a hundred years or so, you will all have dropped your bodies, and yet you will still \nexist. Do not think about your bodies, but think only about me. Then, before you drop your \nbodies, you will be able to remember me. My miracle will be to make you become me. \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p86 \nMy brother Jamshed loved me very much. He was mad with love for me. Once he was so full \nof love for me that he couldn't contain himself, and he dropped his body. But just before \ndying, he shouted out loudly, 'Baba.' He has come to me. He is now with me eternally. \n21 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p26 \nAll this world is nothing, an illusion. I am in everything. I tell you with my authority, I am in \neverything. \nLove me, and that way, when you drop your bodies, then you are with me eternally. \n22 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p29 \nLeave all thoughts, your own thoughts, your selfish thoughts, and simply obey me. Then you \nare Liberated, then you are free. But if you cannot, then more and more bindings are \ncreated, for every action creates a binding. \nYou are very old, Don, ages old. And you are bound. And you will be bound, and you'll go on \ngetting bound age after age. Age after age the same bindings will be created, you'll try to \nfree yourself, and in so doing, get rebound. \nBut once you are Liberated completely, then you'll realise that there was no binding at all. It \nwas just imagination, a dream... you were seeing and experiencing only a dream. \nAll of you here are very old - ancient ones. All are God. God is within each one, and God is \nnot bound by time - he is eternal. You are all eternal. Now you are bound. You feel you are \nbound, and you continue to get bound. But there will be a time when every individual gets \nfreed, gets Liberated. Then that individual realises that all his bindings were just in a dream \n- he was seeing a dream. \nChrist took upon himself the sufferings. Why? To Liberate humanity. And the bindings are \nstill there. Mankind is still bound. Yet Liberation doesn't require time. You are bound for \nages, but when you get Liberated, it is instantaneous - it comes in a flash. \nJust think of it: God is within all, in everyone, and he is infinite. God is all powerful, God is all \nbliss. And yet, though God is in each one, how helpless we feel. We weep, we feel pain, we \nfeel sorrow, although God, who is so infinitely powerful and blissful, is there. Why? It is \nbecause of our own bindings. But there is one way to get Liberated from these bindings, and \nthat is through love... \nIf you can love me, love God, your love will make you know me. If you can make others \nhappy through your love without seeking your own happiness, you can free yourself from \nthis bondage. You can then find me as I really am. No sooner do you get that experience, \nthan you feel Liberated and experience infinite bliss. \n26 July 1956, \nMyrtle Beach, \nAw 4:3 p38-41 \nDon = Don Stevens \nOrdinary Mukti (Najat) is achieved only after death by some exceptionally God-fearing, \nTruth-loving, good souls. And this Mukti usually comes three to five days after the soul has \nleft the body. Since this Mukti is attained without the body, the individual soul enjoys only \nbliss (anand). And although power and knowledge are there, such a Mukta cannot \nexperience them. Such a Liberated soul is conscious only of the bliss of union, and for him \ncreation no longer exists, thereby bringing to an end the constant round of births and \ndeaths. \nNirvikalpa samadhi must not be confused with this ordinary Mukti or Moksha state. Should \na soul reach the Mukti state, it does so after the death of the physical body. Such a soul \nreaches God, but this occurs only after death. Thus there is an important distinction \nbetween ordinary Mukti on the one hand, and Nirvikalpa samadhi on the other, because the \nlatter is experienced while the soul retains the body, and thus becomes Videh Mukta (a \nMajzoob). \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba \nbefore 1955, GS p259 \nI say with my divine authority to each and all that whoever takes my name at time of \nbreathing his last comes to me. So do not forget to remember me in your last moments. \nUnless you start remembering me from now on, it will be difficult to remember me when \nyour end approaches. You should start practicing from now on. Even if you take my name \nonly once every day, you will not forget to remember me in your dying moments. \n1958, Aw 21:2 p41 \nThere is one real birth and one real death. You are born once, and you really die only once. \nWhat is the real birth? It is the birth of a drop in the ocean of reality. What is meant by the \nbirth of a drop in the ocean of reality? It is the advent of individuality, born of individuality \nthrough a glimmer of the first most-finite consciousness, which transfixed cognizance of \nlimitation into the unlimited. \nWhat is meant by the real death? It is consciouness getting free of all limitations. Freedom \nfrom all limitations is real death. It is really the death of all limitations. It is Liberation. \nIn between the real birth and the real death, there is no such reality as the so-called births \nand deaths. What happens in the intermediate stage known as births and deaths is that the \nlimitations of consciousness gradually wear off, until consciousness is free of limitations. \nUltimately, consciousness, totally free of limitations, experiences the unlimited reality \neternally. \nReal dying is equal to real living. Therefore, I stress: die for God, and you will live as God. \nYou are first a child, then grow old and drop the body, but you never die and never were \nborn. In the East, Vedantists believe in reincarnation, in innumerable births and deaths until \none attains Godhood. The Muslims believe in one birth only, and one death only; the \nChristians and Zoroastrians the same. All are right. \nBut Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, Zoroaster, all meant what I mean by real birth and real \ndeath. I say you are born once and die once. All the so-called births are only sleeps and \nwakings. \nThe difference between sleep and death is that when you sleep, you awake and find yourself \nin the same body. But after death, you awake in a different body. You never die. Only the \nblessed ones die and become one with God. \n26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina, \nGM p328 \nYou are the individualised ocean. \n(Baba pointed to the brim of a hat he was holding) \nVisualise this hat as you. You see this Gross world. \n(Baba pointed to a box) \nAnd with the help of a saint, you jump backwards and begin to experience the Subtle world. \n(Baba put the box behind the hat, and pointed to a notebook) \nThen again, with the help of another saint, you see the Mental world, not the Subtle or the \nGross. \nBut what does a Perfect Master do? He makes the self turn completely around, make a \ncomplete roundabout turn, and the self disappears. The self goes, and God remains. \nThe question is, how is individuality retained? The stamp of individuality remains, it is left \nbehind to say 'I am God,' 'Beryl is God.' Jesus said, 'I am God.' \nThis stamp or mark remains. It is still real individuality. Remember, the real self is within. \nWhen helped by a Perfect Master, the real self is removed. The imprint that remains is the \noriginal individuality. That is as far as I can explain it or touch your understanding. The real \nself is removed, and the real individuality remains as an imprint. \nSuppose this is the infinite ocean. It is full of drops. Each drop is the ocean as long as it is not \nseparate. So there are innumerable drops in the ocean. One says, 'I am stone.' Another says, \n'I am man,' 'I am woman,' 'I am this,' 'I am that.' \nSuppose there are three drops whose real self is removed, and God remains. But the \nindividuality is there. So Purdom, one drop, says, 'I am God,' and his experience of his own \nocean of bliss is continuous, without a break. Another drop, called Lud, is from the same \nocean. Its real self is removed, individuality remains, and says the same thing, 'I am God.' \nAnd Beryl says 'I am God.' Three drops of the ocean say the same thing, but the experience is \nindividual. It's so easy to understand... so difficult to attain. \nSo what happens when you are pushed into the seventh plane? You leave your false self, and \nalso the real self, and instantaneously you experience yourself as God. \n26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, \nGM p331-332 \nFor a similar explanation, \nsee below (6 June 1958) \nCharles Purdom: Will you comment on what you mean by 'to come to me'? \nBaba: To come to me means Liberation, experiencing me as I am. No more bondage of births \nand deaths. But it does not mean the state of a Perfect Master, of Perfection. That is only to \nbe attained in the Gross body. So if you are not blessed with this state of Perfection, at least \nyou can have Liberation. If you just take my name, just at the moment of dropping your \nbody, you will come to me. Yes, anyone. \nIt's not easy to take my name at the very moment of leaving the body. Then you individually \nexperience bliss, infinite bliss. After Liberation, you continue to experience infinite bliss \neternally. Why? Because it belongs to you eternally. You experience what belonged to you \neternally. Even spiritual ecstasy cannot be compared with divine bliss. Remember this. \n28 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina \nLA p529 (also GM p337) \nHow Individuality is Established in Indivisibility \n(Baba had Adi K. Irani draw three circles on the floor in chalk. The circle on the right was \nlabeled 'Gross,' the middle circle 'Subtle,' and the left circle 'Mental.' To the left of the \n'Mental' circle was the word 'God.') \nAll the three worlds - the Gross, Subtle and Mental - and God the infinite, are within you, \nwho are fully conscious. But you do not experience this. Why? It is because your real I \nwithin is playing the part of the false I. \n(Baba took a hat.) \nLet it represent the false I attached to the real I which is within. \n(Then Baba had the hat placed on the floor between the Gross and Subtle circles, the open \npart of the hat facing the Gross circle.) \nYou, represented by the hat, are in this position - the real I with falseness attached. Because \nof the falseness attached to your real I, you experience only the Gross world with your full \nconsciousness. Your back is, as it were, turned to the Subtle and Mental worlds and to God \nthe infinite, and you cannot see them. \nWith the help of a Wali on the fifth plane, you are able to withdraw within yourself with full \nconsciousness more towards reality, and you experience fully the Subtle world. \n(Baba had the hat placed between the Mental and Subtle circles, with the open side facing \nthe Subtle circle.) \nFrom this position, you cannot see the Gross world, and again your back is, as it were, \nturned to the Mental world and to God the infinite, and so you cannot see them. \nWith the help of a Pir - one on the sixth plane - you are able to withdraw full consciousness \nstill more towards reality, and you experience the Mental world, as you get stationed on it. \n(Baba had the hat moved to between the word 'God' and the Mental circle, with the open \npart facing the Mental circle.) \nWhen you are in this position, you can see only the Mental world. You cannot see the Gross \nor Subtle worlds, and you cannot see God the infinite. \nAt this stage, with the help of one on the sixth plane, you may be given a complete round-\nabout turn with your full consciousness, so that you face God the infinite, and have your \nback turned to all the three worlds within yourself. \n(The hat was turned so that the open side faced 'God.') \nWhen you face the infinite fully, you see him everywhere and in everything, and your \nconsciousness may be said to be your very sight. Even at this stage, when you see God face \nto face, the falseness attached to your real I is still not detached, and therefore the seer and \nthe seen are not united. \n(Baba had the hat removed.) \nThe grace of God takes the falseness from the real I. \nOnly with the help of one on the seventh plane, the Avatar or a Perfect Master, is the \nfalseness attached to the real I completly lifted, and you, as the seer and the seen, become \none. \nBecause your falseness has been lifted by the seventh plane Master, your real I is liberated \nof falseness, and therefore it is you who experience the reality as yourself, and you affirm \nthis experience by saying 'I am God.' \nAny other individual whose falseness has been lifted by the Avatar or a Perfect Master \nsimilarly experiences the state of being 'I am God.' This is because the impress of one's \nfalseness removed from the individual real I retains the stamp of one's real individuality, \nand dwells in the realm of reality. \nThe Perfect Master, Sadguru or Man-God is individualised ocean. The Avatar or God-man is \noceanised individuality. It is the Avatar who knows fully that he is in all and all are in him. \n6 June 1958, \nAvatar's Abode, Australia, \nPS p118-120 \nSee PS for copies of the drawings Baba used \nThough completely happy and enjoying bliss to the fullest... Angels still aspire to attain \nhuman form, because only in human form can a soul become God-realised. God-realisation \nis the divine goal of all life, not Angelic existence or being a god among gods. So the Angels \nand Archangels must attain a human form... to progress further toward Godhood. \nAfter an Angel has existed in Devaloke for four cycles (a cycle is about 26,000 years), the \nAngel has the opportunity of being born in human form. After only one birth and lifetime as \na human being, that Archangel or Angel receives Liberation from all future births and \ndeaths - Mukti, the state of infinite bliss realised. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \n1967, NE p79-81 \nThe Sadgurus bestow Realisation according to the divine plan chosen by the Avatar. So it is \nthe Avatar who chooses who will become God-realised. It is for the Avatar's own special \nCircle and lovers and devotees that he himself bestows Realisation or Mukti (Liberation). All \nother souls receive Realisation or Mukti from the hands of the Sadgurus. Mukti occurs at the \nmoment of death.

For most \nsouls, Liberation is the final goal. He also explained that anyone could become Liberated by \ntaking his name at their time of death. \n\"Those souls who are Liberated have their egoistic minds annihilated.

They are conscious only of the bliss of union. Creation no \nlonger exists for them. Their constant round of births and deaths is ended. This is known as \nMukti or Liberation.\" \nMeher Baba, Di v1 p2 \n\"Good actions bind a man with a golden chain, and bad actions with iron and spiked chains. \nBut the chain is there in either case. The man has not been set free. Yoga or other studies are \ngood actions, and they give the person a better chance in the next incarnation. But they do \nnot set him free, or give Liberation. To have Liberation, one must neither have virtue nor \nvice on one's credit or debit side. But it should be a clean slate, to reach the state described \nin an Urdu couplet: \n'We shall not go either to heaven or hell \nBut on the day of final judgement we shall stand gazing at the face of Muhammad.' \n\"And this is impossible to reach without the grace of the Guru. For a Master, it is the work of \na moment, though. The vast and almost infinite impressions of a person may be likened to a \nheap of dry grass, which it is impossible for the person to clean out. Even the  process of \ncleaning out without a Master, that is, through yoga, etc., means contracting impressions \nagain in different forms. \n\"But this heap of dry grass is a work of a moment for a lighted match, which only the Perfect \nMaster possesses. The Perfect Master uses his matches, but mostly for the members of his \nCircle only, and thus at the right moment brings them to his own level in less than a second. \nBut even those who have no direct connection with a Perfect Master can derive the greatest \npersonal benefit merely through the contact and company of his personality: \n'One moment, half a moment, and even half of a half of a moment \nIn contact with a Perfect Master, and ten million of your sins are washed away.'\" \nMeher Baba, 4 October 1922, Bombay, RD p79-80 \nPart of another version of the same explanation: \n\"No yogi can attain eternal freedom or emancipation, even though he might have reached \nthe highest yogic state of samadhi through his practices, because sanskaras are still there, \nand all ties have not yet been snapped... \n\"Yoga and other practices are good, and merit an aspirant a good life in the next birth, but a \nman is never free from bondage or given Mukti (Liberation) as a result of them.\" \nLM2 p418-419 \n\"The Muslim inmates of Manzil-e-Meem came in for a good deal of Baba's attention, and \nmuch light was thrown on the vexing question of shariat (external religion), the bugbear of \nthe Muslim world when confronted with spirituality and saintliness. A Muslim friend of \nmine quoted the words of the Persian poet Saadi: \n'Verily it is worse than the tortures of hell \nto walk into heaven with the feet of another.' \n\"Meher Baba said, \n'It is really a commendable attitude if heaven can be earned by one's own exertions, instead \nof depending for its acquisition on the grace of another. Leaving aside the question of \naspiring for Khuda-shanashi (God-realisation), the regrettable position is that even the \nproblem of heaven is being relegated to the mercy and grace of Rasul-e-Khuda (the Prophet \nof God). \n'My disciples are not concerned with heaven or hell. They find themselves confronted with \nthe ideal of realisation of Truth - God - Divinity. The gnosis of God is impossible for anyone \nto attain without the help of a Murshid (Master), and the Sufi world insists upon the need of \na Master in unmistakeable terms. \n'By one's own unaided exertions, one either creates heaven or hell, and both are limiting \nand binding. Heaven represents the result of too many good actions (neki), and hell is the \noutcome of too many bad actions (badi). In order to attain Najaat (Mukti, Liberation), a \ncorrect balance of good and bad actions must be struck. The credit and debit side of good \nand bad actions must cancel each other, and the balance sheet must show zero on both \nsides. This result can only be brought about by a Master. If left to individual efforts, one or \nthe other side must predominate, bringing in its wake the situation known to the laity as \nheaven or hell. \n'I do not advocate even the state of Najaat - Mukti* (Liberation of the individual soul) \nbecause you were already that prior to the precipitation of the universe. If salvation means \nreverting to the original state of the ocean, then all the travails of the bubble (individual \nsoul) through the long and laborious stages of evolution have been to no purpose. With me, \nNajaat means the realisation of abdiat (bubble-state) and mabudiat (ocean-state) at one and \nthe same time. Whosoever realises this state can be said to be Perfect. This stage of \nPerfection is known to the Sufis as the reality of Muhammad (Haqiqat-e-Muhammadi), the \ndivine 'I' state, the raison d'etre* of creation. \n'Among many other methods advocated and practised for realising the state of Perfection, \nthe best and the easiest is the company of a Perfect Master. Living with me as you do, you \nare considered to have renounced the world in spite of living in it. Every moment passed in \nthe company of a Master may be said to be spent in what the people call ibadat (devotion).'\" \nAbdul Ghani, about Baba's stay in  Bombay in 1922, BG p60-61 \n(For another related quote, see RD p81-82) \n*raison d'etre = reason for being \n\"Without the sanskaras being totally eliminated, there is no spiritual Liberation. To dispose \nof sanskaras, one has to create reverse sanskaras which are opposite in nature. Opposite \nimpressions reverse the sanskaric makeup of the mind. To remove stains, soap or lime is \nnecessary. But the mind never dies of itself. \n\"For example, suppose your hand is to be broken. It is difficult and almost impossible for \nyou to twist your own hand enough to break it. But if a strong fellow comes along and twists \nit, your hand fractures in a second. That powerful man is the Sadguru, who is required to \ndeal with the mind and all its mischief. \n\"But a Sadguru is not to be found so easily. It requires love, the search for Truth amidst \nhardships and sufferings, and undergoing untold difficulties. These draw the Sadguru to the \ndeserving ones. \n\"If by hurting a person temporarily, you provide a permanent healing, this apparently cruel \nact of yours is, in fact, a blessing. In the same way, suppose that by rendering a temporary \nhealing, you create a permanent hurt. This apparently blessed act of yours is, in fact, a curse. \nA doctor cutting open a boil and causing so much pain to the sufferer is considered an \nenemy who has hurt one. But when the pus is removed, the patient is relieved, and the \ndoctor is considered a real friend who helped. \n\"So the Sadguru is at first apparently considered an enemy when he tries to remove sins and \nwipe out desires and sanskaras of the aspirant by forcing strict discipline on him, \nrenunciation, etc. But when the bliss of union with the beloved God is attained through his \ngrace, he is considered a true friend.\" \nMeher Baba, 9 December 1927, Meherabad, LM3 p991 \n\"Love and self-surrender both lead one to the goal. But generally on the path of love, one \ndrops his body after reaching the final destination. Whereas the one who treads the path of \nsurrender, besides becoming conscious of God, also becomes conscious of the three spheres \n- Gross, Subtle and Mental - and thus returns to Gross consciousness to serve as a beacon of \nlight to others on the Path. That is why surrendering is better than love.\" \nMeher Baba, 18 February 1930 \nNasik, LM4 p1269 \nMunshi Rahim came with his adopted son Bashir to see Baba. Baba had Bashir sit by his side \nand told the Mandali: \n\"Bashir's state is unequalled. He remains quite detached from worldly things. You people \nhave been with me for years, and still demand clothes, soap, razor blades, and a dozen other \nthings. If his present state of detechment lasts, Bashir will one day gain Salvation through \nmy grace. He will then have achieved the aim of his life.\" \nBaba then sent out almost everyone, and asked Bashir what he really wanted. Bashir \nreplied, \"Baba, help me find a good job, as I am in need of money.\" \nBaba smiled, and spelled out on the board, \"See how I raised you up in the presence of all \nthe Mandali, and you have now brought it all tumbling down. You have come down from the \nheights of Mukti (Liberation) to finding employment.\" \nBaba asked Rustom to give Bashir a job, and Bashir gratefully accepted it. \n20 August 1933, Nasik, LM5 p1804 \n\"All relations of those who are with me, whether they know me or not, or even if they do not \nbelieve in me, get salvation.

It even means that without actually remembering him at the \nlast moment, one goes to him - that instead of actually remembering him, if one only \nremembers any worldly action of his or anything worldly one heard about him at the last \nmoment, one goes to him... \n\"Once association with God is well-established, then, as all the worldly things stand before \none's eyes at the last moment, that association will also be there at that time.

    "text": "DREAMS \nMeher Baba \nIn a way, even an ordinary dream is also a subconscious experience of the Subtle, because \neveryone necessarily makes an actual use of one's Subtle body in the dreaming state. But, be \nit noted, through that body one experiences different sensations and happenings pertaining \nto the Gross only. In other words, the ordinary dreaming state is the experience of the Gross \nthrough the Subtle means in the subconscious state. \nc.1933, \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \nSi p8 \nQ. What are dreams? \nBaba: Dreams are subconscious experiences which are always linked with your Gross \nexperiences of the past. Sometimes in your dreams you see persons you never saw in this \nlife. This link is from the past. It is all based on illusion and imagination. So everything \nexcept the Real Self is based on illusion. \nElizabeth Patterson: How was it that when I was twelve years old, I dreamed of you three \ndifferent times in succession, and when I first met you, years after, I recognised you as the \none I had known in the dreams. Was that an illusion? \nBaba: What I mean is that everything except your being infinite is illusion. I am very ancient, \nvery very old, and always young. \nDecember 1936, \nNasik, \nLA p158 \nI will one day explain all about dreams. There are seven kinds. Some are due to indigestion. \nThe sixth has no meaning. The seventh has significance. \nDecember 1936, \nNasik, \nAw 10:2 p10, \nalso LA p158 \nSubconscious experiences, although of the same plane, vary. Some are mere dreams, some \nvisions, some the foretelling of the spending of impressions. But even the subconscious can \nbe hallucinated. Now what is hallucination? This is very interesting. It is not a dream, it is \nlike delusion, but the difference can be understood by examples. You sit relaxed, and in your \nmind, pictures of your home, your mother, etc., come to mind. And you speak to the pictures \nthat you can bring before your mind. This is imagination. \nYou imagine yourself being in America. Now, in your imagination, you think that you can \nactually see your home, your mother, etc., and feel their presence. This is hallucination. As \nanother example, I asked one man to fast for forty days on water only. On the fortieth day he \nsaw figures with ten heads, twelve hands, speaking. He thought this was a spiritual \nexperience, but it was hallucination. \nNow what is the difference between hallucination and spiritual experience? In hallucination \nyou see things, extraordinary things, but never feel blissful or peaceful. This is the only sure \nsign of differentiating between hallucination and spiritual experience. When it is \nhallucination, bliss and peace are impossible. In delusion, too, bliss and peace are not \npossible, but the confusion as to whether it was hallucination or spiritual experience does \nnot remain. \nIn hallucination, you see strange figures, and yet doubt as to whether they exist or not. In \ndelusion, you take things as existing which really do not exist, but you feel sure they do \nexist. Hallucination is like a conscious nightmare. \nSometimes in your dreams you see events that occur years after, and all of a sudden you \nremember having dreamt it. Sometimes you see such funny things, things that have no \nmeaning, or persons whom you have never seen in this life. But you have either seen them \nin the past, or will see them in the future. \nEvolution progresses from the atom towards the infinite, and the soul gathers its \nimpressions from imagination. Your soul has been through this process for millions of years \nthrough every form. So what you can imagine includes, and has as its basis, all that you have \npassed through. And every soul has to pass through negative and positive experiences. \nYou cannot imagine things that you have not seen. You cannot now imagine being in Persia, \nbecause you have never been there. But you can imagine being in England as you have seen \nEngland. So whatever you see in dreams is hallucination, or the projection of imagination. \nBut it is always something you have seen or will see in the future. \nIn a dream, when you sleep, this body (the physical) is not used, and yet you see, smell, hear, \ntaste, etc. You do it all with the Subtle body, but not consciously. When you do it consciously, \nyou actually experience being aloof from the body. You smell, you eat, you hear, you feel, \ndoing it all as concretely as you do with the Gross body, not vaguely as in dreams. You can \nactually feel the body as a cloak. You put it off and on like a garment, actually, not just in \nyour imagination. \nMarch 1937, \nIndia, \nLA p180-181 \nGarrett Fort: How can you imagine things you have never seen? \nBaba: You have seen things far back, ages back. You can never produce what you have not \nseen. Imagination is infinite. But sometimes you see in your dreams events that occur years \nafter, and all of a sudden you remember having dreamed it. Sometimes you see such funny, \nweird things, having no meaning. Or you see persons you have never seen in this life. But \nyou have either seen them in the past, or will see them in the future. \nFort: When you have dreams of future events, have you seen that? \nBaba: You will see it later, even if you have not seen it yet. Imagination is always something \nyou have seen or will see in the future. \n14 March 1937, \nNasik, \nLM7 p2137-2138 \nAnother version, LA p181 \nThe Master usually helps the aspirant through ordinary means, and prefers to take him \nunder the veil. But when there is a special indication, he may also use an occult medium to \nhelp him. Special types of dreams are among the common media which are used for \ntouching the deeper life of the aspirant. Masters have not infrequently first contacted the \naspirants by appearing in their dreams. Such dreams, however, have to be carefully \ndistinguished from ordinary dreams. \nIn ordinary dreams, the Subtle body is active in exercising its functions of seeing, tasting, \nsmelling, touching and hearing, but the soul is not using the Subtle body with full \nconsciousness. As these experiences of ordinary dreams are received subconsciously, they \nare in most cases purely subjective, relating to physical activities and concerning the Gross \nliving, being the creations of the nascent sanskaras stored in the mind. In some cases, \nhowever, a dream which is indistinguishable from ordinary dreams may be the reflection in \nthe subconscious of some objective experience of the Subtle body, and not merely a product \nof fancy. \nMost dreams are purely subjective and subconscious experiences of the Subtle body, and \nthey have no special spiritual significance, except that they can be the occasions for the \nforging of new sanskaras or the spending up of old ones, and that occasionally they shed a \nlight upon the hidden complexes and unfaced problems of personality. But such dreams can \nnever include something which is not in some way a part of the past experience of the \nperson. And they allow scope for novelty only in respect of new combinations of the items \nwhich have already appeared in past experience. \nThe rare types of dreams are the dreams of persons and things which have been known to \nthe man, not in this life, but in some past life or lives. And even still more rare are the \ndreams of persons and things which have never appeared in his life or lives, but are going to \nappear in his life in the future. Ordinary dreams are thus utterly different from dreams \nwhich have occult significance. \n1941? Di v3 p11-12 \nIn rare cases, in spite of the resistance offered by the brain, some memories of past lives \nleak into the present life in the form of dreams which are entirely unaccountable by means \nof the present life. A man may see in his dreams persons whom he has never seen in his \npresent life. It often happens that the persons who appeared in the dreams were persons \nwhom he had met in his past lives. But of course, such dreams, when they are of the \nordinary type, cannot be treated as memory of the past lives. They merely indicate that the \nimagination which worked in dreams was influenced by materials taken from the past lives \nof the man. \nThe real memory of past lives is clear, steady and sure, like the memory of the present life; \nand when it comes to a man, he has no longer any doubt about his having existed in several \nlives, along with many others. Just as he cannot doubt his own past life in the present \nincarnation, he cannot doubt his life in his past incarnations. \n1942? Di v4 p61 \nAs compared with dreams, the physical life is indeed a reality. Similarly, compared with the \nreality of the Path, the world and all worldly life is vacant dreaming on the part of man. But \nas the world and all of its experiences are illusory, so is the spiritual Path that leads to \nreality. The former may be termed false illusion and the latter real illusion. Nevertheless, \ndespite the vast difference between them, they are both illusions, for God alone is the only \nreality. \nc.1952? GS p73 \nThe dream of a man is but a drama enacted by the projection of man's own dormant \nimpressions. These impressions, when projected through man's subconsciousness, create \nthings and creatures of the dream, as Sub-Subtle forms. Man in the dream state not only \nbecomes involved in the drama of his dream, and plays the roles of both the creator of that \ndream and of the hero in the drama of that dream, but in this drama man also gets closely \nassociated with the things and the creatures in their Sub-Subtle forms, which are of his own \ncreation in his dream state. This creation of Sub-Subtle forms comes entirely as a result of \nthe manifestation of man's own past and present impressions. Thus man in his dream state \nassociates subconsciously with forms in Sub-Subtle states. \nWhen recollected by a man in the awake state, these very forms, which he has seen and \nassociated with in the dream state, remind him of his conscious associations with the Gross \nforms as things, creatures and beings associated with in his day-to-day life of the present, \nand link them with his connections and contacts established in his life of the immediate and \nsometimes distant past. But more often than not, a man also recollects in his conscious \nawake state that a particular Gross form, whether of a thing, creature or being, with which \nhe closely associates, and which he actually seeks, reminds him of having witnessed that \nsame object in his dream at some time in the past, either some days, months or years ago. \nThus it actually happens that a form of the future, which he happened to witness in his \ndream of the past, reappears to the man as a Gross form in his life associations of the \npresent. After a lapse of time the same object, that the man was totally ignorant of ever \nhaving seen or contacted before in his lifetime, appears to him now in the awake state, \nexactly as he had witnessed it before in his dream. Experiences of a similar nature are also \nrecorded in which a man witnesses certain incidents in his dreams years in advance of their \nactual occurrence. \nc.1954, GS p94-95 \nWhen you sleep and dream, you experience association with people, speaking with them \nand doing actions in relation to them, see all manner of objects in your surroundings, and \nfeel happiness or unhappiness in regard to them all. Where do all these people and objects \ncome from? Not from outside yourself, but from within you. You create them for your own \nexperiencing, and no one but you sees, knows about and experiences what you are seeing, \nknowing and experiencing. They exist only for you. \nIn like manner, you are sitting in this room seeing these other persons and the objects in the \nroom, and in like manner, no one but you is seeing them and experiencing them - that is, \nseeing and experiencing them as you are seeing and experiencing them. They exist solely for \nyou, and have come from nowhere but from within you. You have created them for your \nexperience of them. \nWhat is called your awake state, your daily life with all its associations and experiences, is \nonly you dreaming, and in your dream creating all the persons and objects in that dreaming \nfor your experience of them. What is called your dreaming when asleep is but another \ndream within this dream. \nWhen you awake from your asleep-dreaming into your awake dream, you know that the \nasleep-dreaming was only a dream. When you awake from your awake-dreaming, you will \nknow that you were the sole creator of both the dreams, and all the people, objects and \nsituations contained in them - that they existed only in you, and were for no one but you, \nand were nothing but dream experiences of your own dreaming - and that you alone have \nreal existence. When real light appears, this darkness, which you think is light, disappears. \nc.1955, SG p167 \nWhen a Gross-conscious person has a dream, he has, as in his waking state, an experience of \nsome place, and also of some mental state and experience associated with it. But the place, \nmental state and experience with which a person is confronted in his dream do not have the \nsame externality or separateness which characterise them in wakefulness. It will be very \nartificial, and even misleading, if we try to separate the place in the dream from the state \nand the experience connected with it, though such separateness presents us with no \ndifficulty when we are concerned with the place, state and experience in Gross-conscious \nwakefulness. \n1956? Be p85 \nAlthough the most important work of consciousness is always done during the waking state, \ndreams also play their part in helping consciousness through the maze of problems which \nbeset it. As a rule, consciousness passes through the dream-state during the transition from \nwaking to sleep, and while returning from sleep to waking. The dream-state serves as a \nbridge between sleep and waking, but it is not an inevitable phase. The mind may swing \nbetween quiescence and waking without subconsciously passing through the dream phase. \nIn the dream-state, consciousness is not completely dormant as in sleep, nor is it fully active \nas in waking. The dream-state is midway between these two phases, and it marks a \ntransition from latent consciousness to active consciousness. The unique virtue of the \nordinary dream-state is that experiences in it are relatively free from the act of willing, as \nwell as from the rigid social demands which prevail in conscious life. \nDespite the seeming lawlessness of the dream-state, it is nevertheless subject to the \naccumulated mental and emotional impressions (sanskaras) which function as inexorably in \nthe dream state as in the waking. Many inclinations and desires which cannot find \nfulfillment in waking life, seek and find gratification in the self-created subjective world of \ndreams. Likewise, many fears and conflicts buried in the subconscious mind inflict upon the \ndreamer a diversity of suffering which the conscious mind would seek to avoid. \nThus dreamland also invites the experiencing of the opposites. The unique characteristic of \ndream experiences is that they afford an opportunity to work out a number of sanskaric \nimpressions without creating any new physical bondage. Many dreams have the same force \nand directive value that inhere in experiences of the waking-state, but these latter are \nalways accompanied by the simultaneous creation of new emotional and mental \nimpressions (sanskaras) that prove to be just as binding as the age-old impressions that \nlimit man's consciousness. Dream experiences, however, result in no such creation of \nfurther bindings. \nAnother interesting aspect of ordinary dreams is that, regardless of what the dream entails, \nit has no direct effect upon any mind other than the dreamer. This is quite contrary to \nexperiences in the conscious waking-state. These invariably involve and affect many other \nsouls as well, thus complicating many life patterns. The activity of consciousness in the \nwaking state creates a bondage of karmic liabilities and assets from which dream \nexperiences are exempt. \nThe dream world is a type of psychic experimental laboratory, insulated from the demands \nof physical life, and thus possessing some advantage over the waking-state. But because it \ndoes not give play to the directive faculty of the will, and isolates the individual soul from \nother souls, it also suffers severe handicaps from which the waking life is free. \nbefore 1957, LH p121-123 \nYou say that you see me in dreams. These dreams arise from your own impressions formed \nthrough your love and faith in me. Do not attribute them to me. I have come into your midst \nto awaken you from the long, drawn-out dream of illusion, not to create more dreams for \nyou. \nc.1960?  India, EN p40 \nYou are really the infinite soul, but you identify yourself with a finite mind, and so have to \nsuffer. You have your moments of happiness and sorrow. Whether your pains outweigh \nyour pleasures or your pleasures outweigh your pains, you worry all day about something \nor the other until your finite existence retreats at night into sound sleep. There you \nunconsciously merge in the infinite. \nIn sound sleep you completely forget yourself and your surroundings, your thoughts and \nemotions, around which are ranged your ideas of imagined happiness and sufferings. But \nthis respite is short-lived. From the sound-sleep state you come down to the normal awake \nstate, and as you come, you have necessarily to pass through a dream state, even though it \nbe only the fraction of a second. \nNow at one time you have a very happy and sweet dream, in which your ideal of happiness \nis fulfilled. But being a dream, it lasts only a little while. And waking pains you so much that \nyou sigh, 'What a pity it was all a dream.' At some other time you have a horrible dream in \nwhich you experience great suffering. Time seems an eternity. As you wake, you feel such \nrelief that you say, 'Thank God it was only a dream after all.' \nIn the dream state you enjoy and suffer. When you wake, you realise that your enjoyment \nand suffering was nothing but a dream, an illusion. But know that your present state of \nconsciousness, which you call being awake, when compared with the real awake state, is \nnothing but a dream state. Your life is a dream within the mighty dream of God which is the \nuniverse. \nc.1960, India, EN p51-52 \n(A man had dreams in which he found himself flying in the air) \nQ. Baba, has this any special meaning spiritually? \nBaba: What meaning? Only that of a dream. We see birds flying. What does that mean \nspiritually? In ancient times some yogis were so powerful that they, too, could fly like birds. \nFor a lover of God such things are neither important nor essential. \n(Baba asked whether anyone present had had dreams of flying. Some raised their hands.) \nBaba: Then such dreams are not uncommon. (Baba pointed at one of the mandali) Even \nsuch a plump person can fly in a dream. What a wonder! Whether you walk on water or fly \nin air, whether it be in a dream as you had, or in the normal awake state, as the ancient yogis \ndid, these things have no meaning spiritually, or very little meaning, worth ignoring. Try \nhonestly to love God, and you will realise that, except love, all other things are meaningless... \nWhere is God? \nQ. God is in everyone and everything, in every particle of dust. \nBaba: Is this not mere book knowledge? Is this your experience? Even a child can make such \nstatements. So unless you have the experience, it is useless to make such statements. If you \nare really keen about the Truth, try to meditate with love on the divine form of your choice, \nor remember the name of God wholeheartedly. Then, with divine grace, a fortunate one sees \nGod face to face, everywhere and in everything, far more clearly and intimately than you see \nthe things in this room now with your physical eyes. \nBefore the real seeing is revealed, one gets many experiences on the Path. If not rightly \nvalued, these experiences prove very alluring and deceptive. If one starts feeling proud \nabout one's flight in a dream, how much pride will the experiences on the Path nourish? One \nhas to be very watchful about the tricky nature of the ego, which tries to maintain its \nseparateness more and more. One thing is certain: the more importance and attention you \npay to such experiences, the more you get bound. Don't run after the experiences, but \nremain steadfast in your love for God. \nGuruprasad, Poona, 1960, DH p1-4 \nHow can a man know that this is only a vacant dream unless he is awakened from it? The \ndream of the universe is ever real until one is awakened. It is simple and easy to say 'It is all \njust a dream. It is all nothing. It is all absurd and meaningless.' But who honestly \nexperiences it as dream, as nothing, as absurd and meaningless? Only the Realised ones. \nEven though consciousness is full and complete in human form, man still thinks that the \nthings he sees with his Gross eyes are real. He takes them to be real when everything is \nfalse. Why? Because of the sanskaras that make the dream appear to be real. \nIt is as if while sleeping, a man dreams he is a king with a royal court, reigning over all, \nsurrounded by grandeur, singing and merriment. This man is enjoying himself, and is at a \ngreat height, for he is a king among men. And were the Ancient one himself, the mischievous \none who is Meher Baba, to tell him, \"You are a fool - a fool. You are only dreaming. You are \nnot a king in the least,\" the man would not believe it. But later, when he awakens, he soon \nrealises that it was a dream and nothing but a dream after all. All that he valued in the \ndream is now meaningless, because it is nothing but the stuff that dreams are made of - \nsanskaras. \nIn the  same way, though awake, the whole world is dreaming. The people of the world do \nnot know that they are dreaming, so deceptive, so binding are the sanskaras, that stuff that \nmakes dreams and more dreams. \nPeople marry while dreaming, have children and homes, work, play, fornicate, fight, love, \nhate, theorise, intellectualise and philosophise, thinking it is all real, when not one \nexperience is real. \nWhen death comes, man leaves his family behind, loses everything that he worked and \nfought for so hard, including his identity, and experiences heaven or hell, but returns again \ninto another man or woman form with a new identity, having forgotten the past. So \neverything and everyone goes on and on - new families, new affairs, different values. \nDeaths and births are as insubstantial as waking and sleeping. The human consciousness \nchanges, not the species, and sometimes experiences itself in the form of a man and \nsometimes as a woman, healthy and sick, sometimes rich, sometimes poor, intelligent and \nstupid, ugly and beautiful, sane and insane, black and white and so forth, 8,400,000 rounds. \nIt is the human consciousness that experiences the diversity of living in one country and \nthen in another, with different beliefs and customs, for ages and ages, before and after \nrecorded history. The diverse human experiences are tremendous, as the sanskaric patterns \ndiffer with each individual; in this sense, the uniqueness makes it an adventure. But the goal \nis to become awakened, and to achieve that state the Jeevatma finally realises, after \ncountless cycles of births and deaths, that it's self is not outer consciousness. \nWhen what one sees has no reality, the inevitable must occur: the consciousness looks \nwithin and begins the inner journey, and the Jeevatma again dreams, but this time the \ndream is divine. \nWhen the Jeevatma begins the inner journeys, it means he dreams the divine dream of \nbecoming God. 'I will become God - I will know him, and thereby become him' ... \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1967, NE p56-58 \nIn the ordinary awake state, energy and matter manifest in Gross form. In the ordinary \ndream state, energy and matter manifest in Sub-Subtle form, meaning the breath is drawn \nwithin (inhaled), and becomes internal in a semi-Gross form. \nIn the dream state, the dreamer has an impression of energy in a Gross sanskaric form; the \nGross sanskaras of the person are in a partially non-functioning state; Gross action stops, \nbut certain predominant Gross thoughts remain. \nThe impressions one has while dreaming are also a result of sanskaras accumulated from \npast lives, which give rise to situations in dreams that are associated with the present. The \npast molds the future; for this reason, dreams can probe into the future but do not fully \nreveal the future. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1967, NE p305 \nDreams Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

He who does not possess \nsuch an attribute is a man full of self-interest. \n25 April 1924, Meherabad, RD p318 \nAnother version: LM2 p624 \nLove is the divine gift given by the Sadgurus. Even if the whole world wants to, it can never \nbestow such a gift. And once it is granted, not even all of humanity can snatch it away, no \nmatter how hard it strives to do so. \nLove is the divine gift. Once you know how to love, there is no trouble. Once you have \nadapted yourselves to the way, your hardships disappear. \n11 October 1927, \nToka, \nto the boys of the Prem Ashram, \nLM3 p1106 \nA tavern-keeper first receives cash from a customer before handing him the wine glass. He \nchecks the coin to ascertain whether it is genuine or counterfeit. Similarly, the Sadguru also \ndemands his price - not in money, but in love, before giving you the gift of love. You can \ndeceive a wine-seller by passing him counterfeit coins, but never a Sadguru. He has no use \nfor false coins - the show of love... \nBut love entails pain - the pain of the pangs and thirst of separation while constantly \nburning. This gradually minimises the strength of the ego, and eventually destroys it, \nbecause love never thinks of or cares for itself. It just burns its victim in love for its beloved. \nThis burning gradually diminishes the ego, and thus it is eventually totally annihilated. In \nthis fire, love makes its victim realise the self. \n30 March 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1293 \nLove means longing. Love means restlessness. Love means harassment. Love means \nseparation. It is all necessary. \n4 April 1930, \nMeherabad, \nLM4 p1299 \nPeople pray to me to solve their difficulties, saying that they love me. But there is a vast \ndifference between love and prayer. In Persian to pray means to beg, to want, to desire \nsomething, even the blessings of God. \nBut when a person really loves, he gives himself over to his beloved completely. This is true \nlove. In that there is no begging, no wanting, and no room for desires. Only the longing to \nunite with the beloved remains. \nLove means the renunciation of the self. Prayer means selfishness, no matter how high the \nprayer may be. So there is a vast difference between when one prays and when one loves. \nJuly 1931, \nKarachi, \nLM4 p1374 \nThe aim of life is to realise God. How? By making the highest ideal of religion our conduct in \nlife. This noble ideal is love. Only the way of love is the best and easiest path. It means to \nlove only God, and none besides him. \nMaterial love is good, but it should be selfless and desireless. Love should be absolutely \ndevoid of lust, and it should be steadfast and unchanging. \nIf a woman is in the mood, she will be after one man today, another tomorrow, and a third \nthe day after. This is not love, it is lust. Mind's tendency is that it always hankers after \nchange - from one thing to another, one person to another, one place to another. Have love \nfor only one and one alone. \nFebruary 1932? \nBombay? \nto Pilamai Hormuzd, \nLM5 p1536 \nThe reason of my coming here all the way from one end of the country to the other to \nparticipate personally in your celebrations is your love that has irresistibly drawn me to \nyou. \nLove is a mighty force. It not only enables one to put the ideal of selfless service into \npractice, but would transform one into God. With love, one can follow any of the yogas most \nsuitable to his or her temperament. It will enable an aspirant to follow the rigid principles \nunderlying the spiritual Path, and where and when necessary, make him turn his back to the \nworldly pleasures for the sake of union with the beloved. \nWhere there is love, there is oneness, and there can be no question of any particular religion \nor caste or system, superiority or inferiority, and touchability or untouchablity. That these \ndistinctions are not real has been proved, in a way, by the recent earthquake tragedy. The \nearthquake in Bihar was simply a manifestation of one of the laws of nature. And that \ndisaster spared none, rich or poor, high or low. belonging to this religion or that. It was not \ndivine wrath. It is an eye-opener to the fact that where God and his laws are concerned, \nthere is no question of caste, creed or country. \nBut to realise this natural equality permanently, one has to submit to the greatest law of \nGod, which is love. It holds the key to all problems, inasmuch as under this law the Infinite is \nrealised completely at all times, in every walk of life, be it science, art, religion or beauty. \nMay the world realise this highest aspect of divinity more and more. \nFebruary 1934, \nMadras, \nMe p6-7 \nThose who are united in love know no separation. \n15 November 1934, \nIndia, \nMe p7 \nLove the one in the many, and not the many in the one. \nto Kitty Davy, 1937? \nIndia? \nLA p165 \nLove is the fountain of life-giving water. No one and no thing can live without love. Its \nexpression varies according to the capacity of the receiver and the giver, and in its highest \nform, love is divinity. \nTo love is to live. You cannot really live without love. The omnipotent laws of nature have \nthis power in its divine potency pervading the universe. The right to strike at the chord of \nlove only belongs to the brave and sturdy at heart. \nHectic search for exhilarating experiences should not be mistaken for love. They are the \nforerunners of grim, relentless penalties and intense suffering. \nLove from its lowest to its highest expression has its ups and downs. Love suffers the pangs \nof separation, the stings of jealousy, and all the little pricks that a lover has to endure are the \ndifferent helpmates in disguise. They stir you up and bring forward to life the most \nimportant parts of your nature. Then they no longer maintain their individual life, but \nmerge in one common longing for the beloved. \nOne in love tastes the glories of life to the full. The blissful heights of joyousness and the \nbuoyant feelings of heavenly delights are the steady steps towards divine oneness. Love \nsurrenders to the will of the beloved, gives all to the beloved, sacrifices all for the beloved, \nlives for the beloved, dies for the beloved. This supreme state of love is the God-state, for \nwhat is God but love - infinite, unbounded, eternal love? \nLove annihilates the lower self, and expresses the higher self. So, dear soul, long for your \ndivine beloved till you become one with your beloved. \nJanuary? 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p165 \nHonestly, there are many ways of testing love and faith. Love always seeks the will, the \nhappiness, the pleasure and the commands of the beloved, always. Love never thinks of \nitself. That is love - that is God... \nDid I ever tell you the story of Ramdas and Kalyan? Ramdas was a spiritual Master at the \ntime of Shivaji. He had many disciples, the favorite among whom was Kalyan. Ramdas \nwanted to test his devotion. He asked all his disciples to come together, and he pretended to \nbe sick to the point of death. He had put a mango over the knee-joint to simulate swelling, \nand bound it up. It seemed to be swollen like a tumor, which Ramdas said it was. \nThen he asked his disciples whether any of them would suck out the poison from the knee-\njoint, saying that whoever did so would die in his place, but that he would be pleased. While \nall the other disciples hesitated, Kalyan arose immediately and sucked the knee-joint, but \ninstead of poison, he sucked the juice of the mango. \nThis is love - to be ready to die for love of the beloved, for the happiness of the beloved. All \nthis means love, faith and sacrifice. \n19 May 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p172-173 \nOther versions: Aw 16:2 p54, Di (7th ed.) p149-150 \nYou will always find very many who do not obey. They are just devoted. They worship, but \nthey do not obey. Is this clear? Obedience is more important than devotion, even if it is done \nunwillingly. It counts for a great deal, because afterward, in the process, duality vanishes, \nand responsibility falls upon one person - the Master, the one you obey. If he tells you to get \nup, you must. If he calls you, you must go. \nLove is even higher than obedience. In real love - not ordinary love - love, obedience and \ndevotion are inherent. Such love gives life, body, soul - all to the beloved. This love is higher \nthan both obedience and devotion. The next step to this love is union. \nTherefore, love. Give more love, and more and more love. \nBig hearts always give, and give in. Small hearts take, and take in. \nOne day, I will explain more about love to you all. Love is not understood properly. Every \nemotional act cannot be counted as proceeding from love. The true sign of love is to give \neverything, to give and give. \nOne day I will explain about pure love. A mother loves her child, but that is not pure love. It \nis love plus self-satisfaction. In real love there is no desire for satisfaction, only for \nsatisfying. \nNowadays even lust is taken for love. The subtle difference is missed. There is a very subtle \ndifference between love and lust, but it is quite clear. They are two different things. You love \nrice and curry - this is lust. You love a cigar - lust again. You love curry and eat it, but do not \ngive anything by the act. You finish the beloved. \n9 February 1937, \nNasik, \nLM6 p2092. \nAnother version: LA p154, 173 \nLove is a strange binding. It binds and unwinds. The more you bind yourself to the beloved, \nthe greater the freedom (unwinding) you have. But such love is very rare. \nIn fact, love is an ocean of fire that you have to cross to meet the beloved. So love - more \nlove - more and more love. \n9 February? 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p154 \nLove in its highest aspect is God. \n3 May 1937, \nNasik, \nAw 16:2 p52 \nWhat is love? To give, and never to ask. \nWhat leads to this love? Grace. \nWhat leads to this grace? Grace is not cheaply bought. It is gained by being always ready to \nserve, and reluctant to be served. There are many points which lead to this grace: \nWishing well for others at the cost of one's self. \nNever backbiting. \nTolerance supreme. \nTrying not to worry. Trying not to worry is almost impossible - so try. \nThinking more of the good points in others, and less of their bad points. \nWhat leads to this grace? Doing all the above. If you do one of these things perfectly, the rest \nmust follow. Then grace descends. Have love - and when you have love, the union with the \nbeloved is certain. \nWhen Christ said, 'Love your neighbor,' he did not mean fall in love with your neighbor. \nWhen you love, you give; when you fall in love, you want... \nLove is pure as God. It gives and never asks. That needs grace. \nYogis in the Himalayas, with their long eyelashes and long beards, meditating, sitting in \nsamadhi, they too, have not this love, it is so precious. The mother dies for her child - \nsupreme sacrifice - yet it is not love. Heroes die for their country, but that is not love. Love - \nyou know when you have love. You cannot understand theoretically, you have to experience \nit. \nMajnu loved Leila. This was pure love - not physical, not intellectual, but spiritual love. He \nsaw Leila in everything and everywhere. He never thought of eating, drinking, sleeping, \nwithout thinking of her, and all the time he wanted her happiness. He would have gladly \nseen her married to another if he knew that would make her happy, and die for her husband \nif he thought she would be happy in that. \nAt last it led him to me - no thought of self, but of the beloved, every second and continually. \nYou would not be able to do that if you tried. It needs grace. Trying leads to grace. \nWhat is God? Love. Infinite love is God. \n28 May 1937, \nNasik, \nPL p76-77. \nOther versions: \nLA p192-194, LM6 p2184-2185 \nWilliam Warner: For a long time, I have been trying to find out the actual definition of love. \nCan you tell me what it is? \nBaba: Love means a life of giving, without expectation of receiving any reward. People must \ngive and then receive. First give, and then you will have all. But instead, people want to first \nhave all, and then think of giving. This is not the right way. \n21 August 1937, \nCannes, France, \nLM6 p2207 \n(A lawyer told Meher Baba that he had heard many people talk about love, but he still \nwondered what love really was.) \nBaba: Are you married? \nMan: Yes. \nBaba: Have you any children? \nMan: Yes. \nBaba: Do you love them? \nMan: Yes, in the ordinary way. But I cannot say that is real love. My object is to have real \nlove, not this mayavic affection or attachment. I have visited saints in the hope of \nexperiencing real love, but so far have not succeeded in any way. \nBaba: You must first understand what real love means. Selfish motives, even in what people \ncall love, often deceive them, and they mistake selfish feelings for love. I will make the point \nclear with an example. \nA person talking of love will say, 'I love my beloved. I want my beloved to be with me,' and \nso on. But in all these expressions of love, the 'I' and 'my' are most predominant. Another \nexample: suppose you find your child running about in tattered clothes and feeling unhappy \nabout it. You will readily feel for it, and do all in your power to get good clothes and make \nthe child happy. On the other hand, if you see a child in the street in similar conditions, i.e. in \ntorn and tattered clothes, would you feel the same and act as readily as you did in the case \nof your own child? If not, it shows how your attitude towards your own child is merely a \nresult of your selfish feeling. \nYour feelings could be called the outcome of true love if your attitude towards the unknown \nchild of a stranger in the street were the same as towards your own child under the same \nconditions. Complete absence of selfishness is therefore the true characteristic and real test \nof pure love. \nIt might be said that it is difficult to attain, and at the same time it could also be stated that \nthe stage is easy to reach. Paradoxical as these statements might seem, they are \nnevertheless true. It is difficult to attain to the stage of selflessness so long as the aspirant \nhas not resolved to reach it. In the absence of a firm determination, the external \nattachments connected with the lower self prove too strong to be overcome, with the result \nthat the aspirant does not find it possible for him to attain to his goal. On the other hand, if \nthe aspirant with a strong will decides once and for all to achieve his aim at any cost, he \nfinds his task easy. \nFor example, you have an old coat which you like very much. You cannot get rid of it until \nyou make up your mind and boldly take it off, to do away with it once and for all. The bold \ndecision makes the task easy which would otherwise be difficult. \nSelf-renunciation is so necessary for experiencing pure love. This renunciation does not \nmean that one has to leave all the worldly connections and affairs and go to the jungles. It \nreally means remaining in the world and discharging one's own duties faithfully, yet \nkeeping aloof from all attachment. This is not an unattainable ideal, but a practical goal \nwhich can be attained with ease, provided, of course, the aspirant sincerely and boldly \nresolves to reach it. \nJust as a man, when he is hungry, longs for food, similarly, when an aspirant desires to \nexperience pure love, he feels the longing for it, and at the proper time he gets the necessary \ndirections and help from a Master to attain to the goal of desirelessness, and is able to enjoy \nfinally the bliss of divine love. This is a state to be experienced and not to be intellectually \ndescribed. \n24 December 1939, \nBangalore, \nTr p239-242 \nAnother version: LM7 p2486-2487 \nThe greatest need of humanity today is love -- love divine, which is pure and selfless, which \nawakens man to the proper sense and understanding of his real duty in life, which is to find \ntrue happiness in giving, not in receiving; in serving, and not in being served; and in \nwillfully participating in the sufferings of others more than in their happiness. \nMy mission in life is to kindle that divine spark of love in all. \n23 November 1941, \nin a letter to G.S.N. Moorty, \nLM8 p2737 \nLove is its own excuse for being. It is complete in itself, and does not need to be \nsupplemented by anything else. The greatest saints have been content with their love for \nGod, desiring nothing else. \nLove is no love if it is based upon any expectation. In the intensity of divine love, the lover \nbecomes one with the divine beloved. \nThere is no sadhana greater than love, there is no law higher than love, and there is no goal \nwhich is beyond love, for love in its divine state becomes infinite. \nGod and love are identical, and one who has divine love has already got God. \nc.1942? \nIndia, \nDi v5 p43 \nsadhana = spiritual practice \nThe spiritual Path is like climbing up to the mountain-top through hills and dales and thorny \nwoods, and along steep and dangerous precipices. But on this Path there can be no going \nback or halting. Everyone must get to the top, which is the direct realisation of the supreme \nGodhead. All hesitation or sidetracking or resting in the halfway houses is but \npostponement of the day of true and final fulfillment. \nYou cannot be too alert on this Path. Even the slightest of lingering in the false world of \nshadows is necessarily an invitation to some suffering which could have been avoided if the \neyes had been steadily fixed on the supreme goal of life. \nIf there is one thing which is most necessary for safe and sure arrival at the top, it is love. All \nother qualifications which are essential for the aspirants of the highest can and must come \nto them if they faithfully follow the whispers of the unerring guide of love, who speaks from \nwithin their own hearts and sheds light on the Path. \nIf you lose hold of the mantle of this guide, there is only despair in store for you. The heart \nwithout love is entombed in unending darkness and suffering. But the heart which is \nrestless with love is on the way to realisation of the unfading light and the unfathomable \nsweetness of life divine. \nHuman love should not be despised, even when it is fraught with limitations. It is bound to \nbreak through all these limitations and initiate the aspirant into the eternal life in the Truth, \nso that the lover loses his separate and false self, and gets united with God, who is the one \nmatchless and indivisible ocean of unsurpassable love. \nThe gateway to this highest state of being one with God is firmly closed for all who do not \nhave the courage to lose their separate existence in the restless fire of divine love. I give my \nblessings to all who are thirsting for the full realisation of divinity, for they shall be the \npillars of the coming era of Truth and love. \n12 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p69-70 \nTrue love is very different from an evanescent outburst of indulgent emotionalism or the \nenervating stupor of a slumbering heart. It can never come to those whose hearts are \ndarkened by selfish cravings, or weakened by constant reliance on the lures and \nstimulations of the passing objects of sense. \nBut to those whose hearts are pure and simple, true love comes as a gift through the \nactivising grace of a Master. Such love is energising and life-giving. It breaks asunder the \nnarrowness and the prejudices which separate man from man. It inspires man for selfless \nand creative action which contributes to the well-being of all, without distinction of caste, \ncolor, race, nationality, creed or sex. It lifts him from the slavishness of sanskaric \nattachments to the unhampered freedom of the divinely conscious soul. And it initiates him \ninto the dynamic harmony of life in eternity. \nAffirmation of the separative ego is the chief veil between man and his own divine self. But \nthe doors of the heart have to be thrown open by the surrenderance of ego-affirmation, if \nGod as the supreme beloved is to make his entry in the heart. \nNo one can realise God except through the grace and help of a God-realised Master, who is \nTruth incarnate. Only a God-realised Master can awaken this true love in the human heart, \nby consuming through the fire of his grace all the dross that prevents its release. \nThose who have got the courage and the wisdom to surrender themselves to a Perfect \nMaster are the recipients of his grace. The grace of the Master does come to those who \ndeserve it. And when it comes, it enkindles in the human heart a love divine, which not only \nenables the aspirant to become one with God, but also to be of infinite help to others who \nare also struggling with their own limitations. \nThere is no power greater than love. \n14 November 1944, \nto the Theosophical Society, \nNagpur, Me p73 \nOf all the forces that can best overcome all difficulties, is the love that knows how to give \nwithout necessarily bargaining for a return. There is nothing that love cannot achieve, and \nthere is nothing that love cannot sacrifice. There is nothing which is beyond me, and there is \nnothing without me. Yet I am and can always be captured with love. \nPure love is matchless in majesty. It has no parallel in power, and there is no darkness it \ncannot dispel. It is the undying flame that has set all life aglow. All the same, it needs to be \nkindled and rekindled in the abysmal darkness of selfish thoughts, selfish words and selfish \ndeeds, in order to burst out in a mighty big spurt to serve as a beacon for those who may yet \nbe groping in the darkness of selfishness, be it deep blue or all black. \nThe light of love is not free from its fire of sacrifice. In fact, like heat and light, love and \nsacrifice, so to say, go hand in hand. The true spirit of sacrifice that springs spontaneously \ndoes not and cannot reserve itself for particular objects and special occasions. \nJust as it can never be too late or too early to learn to love for the sake of love, there can be \nnothing too small or too big to be sacrificed or sacrificed for. The flow of life, the flow of \nlight and the flow of love is as much in the drop as in the ocean. The smallest thing is as big \nas the biggest, and the biggest thing is as small as the smallest. It all depends upon the \nparticular yardstick with which one measures a thing. \nThe spirit of true love and real sacrifice is beyond all ledgers, and needs no measures. A \nconstant wish to love and be loving, and a non-calculating will to sacrifice in every walk of \nlife, high and low, big and small, between home and office, streets and cities, countries and \ncontinents, are the best anti-selfish measures that man can take in order to be really Self-ful \nand joyful. \nMay you one day behold the ever-shining light of love, that never dies and knows no \ndarkness. \nMy blessings to you, one and all. \n1947, \nSurat, \nAw 7:2 p3-4 \nSince, in the very beginning, imagination gave a twist to substance, and importance to \nshadow, we, who are eternally free, find ourselves bound, having lost our original self in the \nmaze of illusion. Therefore, despite possessing infinite bliss, we have to experience misery, \nworries, doubts, failure and helplessness. \nWhen in a flash real knowledge comes, we are not what we seem, but are that infinite one. \nAll worries disappear, because in reality sukh (pleasure) and dukh (misery) do not exist. To \nget rid of this persistent ignorance and to know the true value of reality, we have to \nexperience God. And God, who is the breath and life of our lives, can only be experienced \nthrough honest love. \nWe have to love him silently and honestly, even in our everyday life. While eating, drinking, \ntalking and doing all our duties, we can still love God continuously, without letting anyone \nknow. When God is found, you can have no idea what infinite bliss and peace is gained. \nI give you all my love, so that someday you can love God as he ought to be loved. \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nBG p6-7 \nLovers of God are called Mard-e-Khuda. When one loves God, the only longing is for union \nwith God. 'I want to see you, my beloved,' is the constant cry of this mad lover. \nCircumstances do not touch this lover. People may call him mad, may make him suffer \nuntold hardships, but his life's only desire is to see God. \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nBG p7 \nGod needs love, not ceremonies or shows. This love has to be so profound that when the \nheart loves him, the mind should not be aware of it. \nGod is equally within us all, and we must love him. When we realise him, all our suffering \ncomes to an end. And for this we must love him in every walk of life. Love (for God) is best \nexpressed when we give happiness to others at the cost of our own happiness. My blessings. \nGod is the only one worth living and dying for. If we love him intensely and honestly, we \nfind him in ourselves and in everyone. The least trace of hypocrisy keeps him away from us. \nWhen we find him, we experience infinite bliss. We then see him everywhere and as our \nown self. I give my blessing for that love which will help you to love God as he ought to be \nloved. \n1 November 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nthree separate messages, \nGG4 p154, 158, 160 \nMy message has always been, and always will be, love divine. When one wholeheartedly \nloves God, one eventually loses oneself in the beloved and enters the eternal life of God. \nLike a tree, such love has branches: branches of wholehearted devotion, perfect \nnonviolence, perfect selfless service, self-denial, self-sacrifice, self-renunciation, truth, and \nself-annihilation. In this love is embodied all the yogas known to saints and seekers. \nThe highest aspect of this love, which surpasses that of love itself, is the aspect of complete \nsurrenderance to the will of the beloved; that is, absolute obedience to his wishes, whatever \nthe cost. \n1954? \nIndia, \nMD p4 \nLove, as it is generally and commonly understood, is but an attachment, with selfish \nthoughts and motives involved. \nPure, real unadulterated love has in it not even a tinge of lust. Lust for sex, lust for power, \nlust for name, lust for fame, lust for self-comforts, defile the purity of love. \nPure, real love also has its stages, the highest being the gift of God to love him. When one \ntruly loves God, one longs for union with him, and this supreme longing is based on the \ndesire of giving up one's whole being to the beloved. \nWhen one loves a Perfect Master, one longs to serve him, to surrender to his will, to obey \nhim wholeheartedly. Thus pure, real love longs to give, and does not ask for anything in \nreturn. \nEven when one truly loves humanity, one longs to give one's all for its happiness. When one \ntruly loves one's country, there is the longing to sacrifice one's very life without seeking \nreward, and without the least thought of having loved and served. When one truly loves \none's friends, there is the longing to help them without making them feel under the least \nobligation. When truly loving one's enemies one longs to make them friends. True love for \none's parents or family makes one long to give them every comfort at the cost of one's own. \nThought of self is always absent in the different lovings connected with the various stages of \npure, real love. A single thought of self would be love adulterated. \n1954? \nIndia, \nMD p6 \n... For the fulfillment of the divinely ordained plan, it is necessary that humanity should \nthrow away all its accumulated impediments, and surrender unconditionally to the abiding \nlove of God, the unfailing and supremely universal beloved. God has to be accepted in all \nsimplicity, and not by laboriously proved intellectual conclusions. \nWine is prepared by the crushing and further crushing of grapes, when it acquires the \ncapacity for intoxication, which usually takes away one's command of understanding. Close \nand repeated feeling of love for God also brings intoxication, but this takes you towards true \nunderstanding. This understanding is not gained through reason or intellect. \nAs long as you remain separated from God and try to understand him, he cannot be \nunderstood. There is no separation between you and God. Lover and beloved are one. You \nyourself are the way. You are God. \n1954? \nIndia, \nMD p16-17 \nTo love God in the most practical way is to love our fellow beings. \nIf we feel for others in the same way as we feel for our own dear ones, we love God. \nIf, instead of seeing faults in others, we look within ourselves, we are loving God. \nIf, instead of robbing others to help ourselves, we rob ourselves to help others, we are \nloving God. \nIf we suffer in the sufferings of others, and feel happy in the happiness of others, we are \nloving God. \nIf, instead of worrying over our own misfortunes, we think ourselves more fortunate than \nmany, many others, we are loving God. \nIf we endure our lot with patience and contentment, accepting it as his will, we are loving \nGod. \nIf we understand and feel that the greatest act of devotion and worship to God is not to hurt \nor harm any of his beings, we are loving God. \nTo love God as he ought to be loved, we must live for God and die for God, knowing that the \ngoal of all life is to love God, and find him as our own self. \n12 September 1954, \nAhmednagar \nAw 2:2 p1-2. Also GG6 p93 \nThere are three types of lovers of God. The first is the mast, who loves and knows only God. \nHe loses all consciousness of self, of body and the world. Whether it rains or shines, whether \nit is winter or summer, it is all the same to him. Only God exists for him. He is dead to \nhimself. \nThe second type of lover is the one who lives in the world, attends to all worldly duties fully, \nyet all the time in his heart he knows that this is temporary, that only God exists, and he \nloves God internally, without anyone knowing it. \nThe third type, which is the highest, is very rare. Here the lover surrenders completely to \nChrist, to the Avatar, to the God-man. He lives, not for himself, but for the Master. This is the \nhighest type of lover. Unless you have such love, merely to criticise and to judge others will \ntake you nowhere. \n14 September 1954, \nMeherabad, \nGM p230 \nLove is a gift from God to man. Obedience is a gift from Master to man. And surrender is a \ngift from man to Master. \nThe one who loves desires to do the will of the beloved, and seeks union with the beloved. \nObedience performs the will of the beloved, and seeks the pleasure of the beloved. \nSurrender resigns to the will of the beloved, and seeks nothing. \nOne who loves is the lover of the beloved. One who obeys is the beloved of the beloved. One \nwho surrenders all - body, mind and all else - has no existence other than that of the \nbeloved, who alone exists in him. Therefore greater than love is obedience, and greater than \nobedience is surrender. And yet, as words, all three can be summed up in one phrase: love \ndivine. \nOne can find volumes and volumes of prose and poetry about love, but there are very, very \nfew persons who have found love and experienced it. No amount of reading, listening and \nlearning can ever tell you what love is. Regardless of how much I explain love to you, you \nwill understand it less and less if you think you can grasp it through the intellect or \nimagination. \nHafez describes the bare truth about love when he says, \nJanab-e ishqra dargah basi bala tar-azaq'l ast; \nKasi in astan busad kay jan der astin darad. \n\"The majesty of love lies far beyond the reach of intellect; \nOnly one who has his life up his sleeve \ndares kiss the threshold of love.\" \nThe difference between love and intellect is something like that between night and day; they \nexist in relation to one another and yet as two different things. Love is real intelligence \ncapable of realising Truth. Intellect is best suited to know all about duality, which is born of \nignorance and is entirely ignorance. When the sun rises, night is transformed into day. Just \nso, when love manifests, not-knowing (ignorance) is turned into conscious knowing \n(knowledge). \nIn spite of the difference between a keenly intelligent person and a very unintelligent \nperson, each is equally capable of experiencing love. The quality which determines one's \ncapacity for love is not one's wit or wisdom, but one's readiness to lay down life itself for \nthe beloved, and yet remain alive. \nOne must, so to speak, slough off body, energy, mind and all else, and become dust under the \nfeet of the beloved. This dust of a lover who cannot remain alive without God - just as an \nordinary man cannot live without breath - is then transformed into the beloved. Thus man \nbecomes God. \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p17-18 \nWhat does love mean? We find volumes and volumes written. There are very few who have \nfound love and who have it... \nMan cannot possess love by means of anything except the gift of the one who possesses that \nlove. No sooner you are gifted with that love, there is no duality. You can't bargain for love. \nNo amount of penance, meditation, puja, etc. can give that gift of love. Once that gift comes \nfrom God, it burns up all veils of sanskaras. \nHe alone knows the real meaning of love who receives the gift of love from God. That lover \nwho so receives it cannot express it to others. His mouth is stitched, and not even smoke \ncomes out. No sooner is love visible, and others can sense that he is a lover of God (e.g. by \ntears, japa, puja, etc.), he is not the lover of God really. I tell you with my authority. The gift \nof love knows no law... \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nLJ p63-64 \nWhen you become one with God, the bliss that you experience is eternal, infinite. There is no \nbreak in that bliss. It is continual. And then you can make others happy. You get the \nauthority to make others happy. The only thing I have been repeating ever since the first \ntime I came is love God. Age after age I have been saying nothing but love God. \nLove -- everyone now uses the word love. It has been made so very cheap. If one really \nloves, one would never utter that word. \nWhat does it mean to love God? It is a very, very great thing. The true lover of God never \nsays anything. He forgets that he loves God. How will you love God? How should you love \nGod? Not through meditations, not through so-called prayers or other things. There are two \nways. One is to leave all and everything. That means to have nothing of your own, not even \nyour body... to renounce absolutely everything. Everything means not only your \nsurroundings, but everything, including yourself. \nThe second thing is something great. There you don't have to renounce anything. You can \nlead a family life, be in the world, do your work or business, attend your services, attend \ntheatres, parties, everything. But always - do one thing. Constantly think, constantly try to \nmake others happy, even at the cost of your own happiness. That is the second way of loving \nGod. \n21 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p24-25 \nYou have to love God so much, till you are goofy with love. \nJuly 1956, \nNew York, \nHM p245 \nLove burns the lover. \nDevotion burns the beloved. \nLove seeks happiness for the beloved. \nDevotion seeks for blessings from the beloved. \nLove seeks to shoulder the burden of the beloved. \nDevotion throws the burden on the beloved. \nLove gives. \nDevotion asks. \nLove is silent and sublime, devoid of outward expression. \nDevotion expresses itself outwardly. \nLove does not require the presence of the beloved in order to love. \nDevotion demands the presence of the beloved to express affection for the beloved. \n1958? India? PS p108 \nAnother partial version: GM p313-314 \nand PL p84 (both missing one line) \nBeloved God is in all. What then is the duty of the lover? \nIt is to make the beloved happy without sparing himself. Without giving a second thought to \nhis own happiness, the lover should seek the pleasure of the beloved. The only thought a \nlover of God should have is to make the beloved happy. Thus if you stop thinking of your \nown happiness, and give happiness to others, you will indeed play the part of the lover of \nGod, because beloved God is in all. \nBut while giving happiness to others, if you have an iota of thought of self, it is then not love \nbut affection. This tends to seek happiness for the self while making others happy. For \nexample, a husband's affection for his wife. The husband wants to give happiness to his \nwife, but while doing so, he thinks of his own happiness too. Or a mother's affection for her \nchild. From this affection, the mother derives happiness purely out of giving and seeking \nhappiness for her child. \nMay 1958? \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina? \nPS p108, Aw 5:3 p53 \nGod is not fooled by any outward show. He is completely deaf to ceremonial prayers and \nringing of church bells and chanting of mantras. He is never taken in by such superficial \nveneer, never ensnared by such blandishments. Love alone can move him, love alone can \nconquer him. Without that, nothing is of any avail. \n1963? India, IS p79 \nIt is love, not questioning, that will bring God to you. \nLJ p26 \nLove Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

A few people came to celebrate the occasion. During a music performance, a \nMuslim began dancing and striking himself on the ground as if overcome with divine \nintoxication. Some spectators were highly impressed, thinking he was a fervent lover of God \nwho was indifferent to bodily injury. \nWhen the singing was over and all had departed, Baba complained of unbearable pain in his \nbody. Twenty of the Mandali began vigorously massaging him, but the pain did not subside. \nBaba: I am suffering because of that Muslim's prancing and jumping. \nPesu: What a frenzy of love overcame that man! \nBaba: It was not love, but a sham. Posing is the greatest sin, and God never forgives it. God is \nafraid of hypocrites, and keeps himself at a distance from them. \nPesu: Then what is love? \nBaba: Fire in the oven. He who loves does not know that he loves. I have warned you to be \nnatural and not pretentious. God cannot be fooled - he knows what you are. So what is the \nuse of pretending to be what you are not? \nBhau  Kalchuri, 30 September 1925, \nMeherabad, LM3 p756 \nAlso see SW p254 \n\"The fun of it all is that you who stay with me, who are with me all day, feel I am one of you, \nso the importance of reverence is naturally nullified, and in its place comes either love or \nordinary familiarity. Now, if it is love, you are unconsciously trying to become like me. But if \nit is only familiarity, then you are trying to make me like you. So love, and then you will \nbecome like me.\" \nMeher Baba, 19 August 1938, \nMeherabad, LM7 p2307 \nNanga Mast, a naked sadhu who looked about thirty years old, met Baba at the Kumbha  \nMela in December 1941. Baba said he was an advanced pilgrim the fourth plane, and told \nthe Mandali: \n\"He is a soul drowned in the ocean of divine love. If someone were to ask me what makes \nme happiest, my reply would be, embracing a mast like the one you saw today. Such love \nconsumes the false ego and annihilates the lower self. Divine consciousness dawns, and the \nhighest asserts itself. Just as the state of man's communion with God, of the soul's \nidentification with the oversoul, and of the lover's union with the beloved are beyond the \nrealm of understanding, so also is the state of this perfect lover of God indescribable.\" \n30 December 1941,  Allahabad, \nLM7 p2749, 2751, W p190 \n\"If there is no love, \na) at least remember me every day 14 times, \nb) do selfless service, because when you forget yourself, you forget the illusory self, when \nyou do selfless service.\" \nMeher Baba, 1955, Meherabad, LJ p69 \n\"I am happy to hear that my lovers at Nagar are inaugurating the Meher center at Khushru \nQuarters. Though it is true that my real center is in the heart of the individual, it is helpful \nfor my lovers to come together and think and talk about me, to discuss my teachings and \nmessages, compare notes with each other, and cooperatively try to come closer to me in \nunderstanding and spirit. The one who does not seek my blessings, and desires nothing \nfrom me but to be able to love and serve me, is my true lover. \n\"In view of my long stay at Meherabad and Meherazad, the Nagar Meher center has a special \nresponsibility and a role to play. In the future, when Meherabad and Meherazad become \nplaces of pilgrimage for my lovers all over the world, the world will be rightly looking \nforward to the Nagar Meher center for receiving my love and truth. \n\"It is therefore for you to have these from me by keeping yourself in inner contact with me, \nby bringing your lives into tune with my will, and by living in a manner that would inspire \nothers to follow you in loving me. \n\"My nazar will be on everyone participating in the functions of the Nagar Meher center, \nwhich no doubt will have a bright future, rising up to the expectations which the world will \nnaturally build up. \nMay you all inherit my life eternal. \nMy love and blessing to you.\" \nMeher Baba, 1962, Ahmednagar \nfor the opening of the Ahmednagar Meher Baba center \n'The Early History of the Ahmednagar Center' by Ward Parks \nMeherana Messenger 1995:2 p3 \nnazar = the glance or blessing of the Master \nLove Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "MANDALI \nMeher Baba \nFrom the very beginning, I have a Circle consisting of a fixed number of men and women. In \nthe near future, these individuals will gain the ultimate experience of Truth and Knowledge. \nOut of millions of souls, only one becomes Perfect. Perfection entails unimaginable \nhardships and sufferings. The Perfect man can bestow divine consciousness, the experience \nof infinity, upon anyone in the twinkling of an eye. The Perfect man bestows conscious \ndivinity, at the right moment, upon those who have an age-old connection with him. \nTo clarify this: suppose a man has suddenly risen to wealth. After becoming rich, however \ngenerous he may be, he will not distribute his riches to every poor person in the world. He \nwill give it to the selected few who are closely connected with him. Further, suppose that \nthis wealthy man is driving in his car and passes a pauper lying beside the road. He will \neither leave him there, or stop and hand him some money. But if he comes across a poor \nman and discovers him to be his long-lost brother, how will he react then? Despite the \nimportance of his errand and the inherent nature of his position (working to gain more \nwealth), he will stop the car, and without the poor man's asking, he will take him in his car \nto his house, and keep him there in luxurious comfort. \nThe same is true in the spiritual Path. To acquire the gift of divine knowledge, a person must \nhave a close connection with a Perfect Master. It was because of this spiritual relationship \nbetween myself and Babajan that she, without my asking, striving or longing for it, \nbestowed on me the experience of God I now have. And it is this intimate spiritual \nrelationship which will make me, in the very near future, share the infinite treasure with \ntwelve of my first disciples. \nJanuary 1922, \nMandwa, \nLM2 p337 \nAlthough the Circle of a Perfect Master has twelve important men members, the total is \nfourteen with two women, and each person has one Shadow. So the complete total of the \nCircle is twenty-eight - fourteen members, with fourteen other members as their Shadows. \nThe original fourteen will be inevitably like the Perfect Master, one in God. The fourteen \nShadows will see God. To see God, however, is not a trifling matter. From thousands of \nyogis, mahatmas and Walis who intensely long to see the light of Truth, very, very few by \ntheir own efforts, and without the help of a Perfect Master, reach the state (of sainthood) \nwhere they can actually see God. But to become one with God is impossible without the the \nhelp of a Perfect soul. \n27? January 1922, \non a train from \nBombay to Poona, LM2 p338 \nYou eat food to maintain your body, and with the body you do different acts. The food in the \nstomach turns into fluid from which blood is made. You know this, but you have no idea or \nexperience as to how it happens. Similarly, those connected with me have gained spiritual \nadvancement, but don't see it or have any idea about it. You who are with me here are \ncompletely unaware of the advancement, but it is definitely there. The closer a person is to a \nPerfect Master, the better it is for him, whether he is a member of the Master's Circle or not. \nMay? 1925, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p715 \nOne's degree of connection with a Perfect Master in past lives makes one eligible for the \nMaster's Circle, whether he is willing or unwilling to obey. But to ease the Master's burden, \none should follow his orders. By your wrong attitude, you add to the Master's troubles. \nSuppose I want two of you to journey with me. One is unwilling and does not budge an inch. \nThe other willingly goes. Both must be taken at the same time to the same place. Whereas \none can be taken easily, the other must be taken with difficulty. At times it comes to this: for \nmy work, the  one resisting has to be shouldered and taken forcibly by me. \nWhile shaving you, the barber moves your head from side to side, which you permit because \nyou need a good shave. Similarly, if you want God, you should surrender body and mind to \nthe Perfect Master and act as he says. \nThe waters of a river are for the use of the populace. The containers the people bring to fill \nwith water are large or small according to their needs. In the same way, the Sadgurus are \nthere only to give. They are the storehouses of knowledge and unlimited blessings. Those \nwho have merit can take as much as their containers can contain. \n30 April 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p791 \nIt is not possible for a Sadguru or the Avatar to give up the physical body until he has \ncompleted the work of preparing his Circle. \n3 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p806-807 \nThe number of my devotees is great, but the number of my disciples is much less. The \ndevotee seeks the pleasure of his own devotion, while the disciple's only duty is to obey the \ncommands of the Master, which is much more difficult. Devotees select their own Master \nand surrender to him. A Master selects his own disciples. Therefore, many can become \ndevotees, but only a few can become disciples. \n9 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p809 \nHow lucky you are that you are the first to speak to me after my seclusion... Spiritually, a big \nmeeting of spiritual personages took place here, the likes of which has never before been \nheld. It is due to the greatest upheaval that is coming for the world. It will be the greatest \nupheaval of all times. \nIt was decided at this meeting that I will manifest as my original real self and speak next \nFebruary. Vast changes everywhere will follow. My Circle, which is already formed, will \nrealise me. Their duties will commence in different directions. And the changes all over will \ncause an upheaval in the world which has never before been experienced, as the greatest \nspiritual revolution of all times takes place. A member of my Circle, Gustadji, will drop his \nbody on becoming Realised. \nMasters and Avatars have their own Circles. The Circle of the Avatar is always the same \ntype, appearing and working with him during his previous Avatarhoods. They have different \nroles in different periods, just as Avatars have. When I was Jesus, for example, two played \nthe roles that Todd and Herbert fill. When I was Krishna, these two were Narad and \nSudama. Certain Circle members have the same personality, face, figure and form, but their \nnames are different during the different Avataric periods. \nBut the Circles of Perfect Masters are always different. While a Master's Circle consists of \ntwelve members, the Avatar's Circle is made up of thirteen members, the extra one being his \ndark side. The Avatar and his dark-sided one are different personalities, but their duties and \nworking are the same. \nBesides this, among the apostles of the Avatar there are really five, but one is a pair of twins \n(Baba pointed to Herbert and Todd), so that the Circle is of fourteen. These twin apostles, in \nexperience are two different, separate individuals, but in their work both are one and the \nsame; meaning they do the same work and have the same duties. \nIn a Master's Circle, as also in an Avatar's, there are four apostles and eight members. Three \nof my apostles are now with me: Kaka and Chanji equal two, and Herbert and Todd are \ncounted as one as they represent the twins... \nIn the cave, I was in a meeting with all the Perfect Masters and saints. So it is now difficult \nfor me to come down. \n7 August 1932, \nAssisi, Italy, \nto Chanji, Kaka, Herbert Davy and Quentin Todd, \nLM5 p1690-1693 \nThose connected with me in past lives become Agents. Those deeply connected become \nmembers of the Circle. \n1930s, \nA p33, \nalso HM p463 \nThere are three types of disciples: those who help, those who are a burden, and those who \nare a hindrance. \nThose who lift me up and carry me are the best helpers. \nThe ones who may not be able to lift me up, but who give me their companionship, assist my \nwork well, and also render much help. \nBut the person who is unable to lift me up and is stubborn, refusing to allow me to lift him, \nis a burden and obstructs me in my work. The obstructionist is the man who does not allow \nme to lift him up, and who does not give me his companionship, but on the contrary, pulls \nmy hand from behind, thus obstructing my work by fighting with me even when I try to lift \nhim. \n31 March 1932, \non the ship Conte Rosso, \nen route from Bombay to Port Said, Egypt, LM5 p1547 \nToday I will tell you something I have not told before to anyone - how the  first Circle was \nformed. There is one indivisible ocean of existence, and only one. All energy, space, light, \npower, life, lie latent in this ocean. Now when the creation comes out of the creation point, it \nmanifests in duality, because this is quite opposite to the ocean. The ocean being one, the \nopposite is many. \nEverything exists in duality when coming out of the creation point - good, bad, weakness, \nstrength - all this lies beyond the creation point. So first, in the very beginning, although this \ncannot be said to have a beginning, two drops expressing this duality came out of the ocean, \nand both evolved equally up through stone form, metal, etc. Energy manifested in vegetable \nform, and the two drops, having the same form and the same energy, faced each other in the \nprocess of evolution. \nNow in the very beginning energy was quite pure, and so a sort of tremor or irritation \nbegan. That is to say, the two energies in these drops of the same quality and quantity, \nfacing each other, attracted each other. And the attraction of the energies toward each other \ndrew the forms together. There was still no intellect, no feeling, no emotion, and yet union \nwas caused. This is termed purwasunk, the sex union without the sex existing - original \nsexless union. Now when they went on evolving and got the animal form, the energies \nincreased, and the impressions of the union in the vegetable form then evolved into instinct. \nAnd instinct acting on energy created the primal sexual passion. \nThe soul has no connection with this. The soul remains quite aloof, and this is all the \noutcome of energy and instinct moving together. The animals do not feel as human beings \ndo, they do not love each other a bit, but passion is in full force. Even attachment to their \noffspring is not love, as some eat their children, some neglect them, and so forth. This is not \nlove or feeling, but only attachment due to passion existing. \nNow when the two drops got the highest animal form, just prior to the human form, full \nconsciousness came, and the consciousness overpowered the energy. And what happened \nwas that the two energies became one, and the two forms became one. So the two drops \nexisted in one form. That first human being having two selves in one form and one energy \nwas Baba - the beginning of the Avataric period. In that Avataric period begins that first \nhuman being who had full consciousness, but no Self-consciousness, because impressions of \nhis previous lives were in his mind. \nNow full consciousness acting on that energy created emotion - to such an extent that it \ncould not control itself. All desires for sex were in full sway as the two were united. So this \ndouble energy got divided again. The first human being had to undergo seventy-seven \nforms. And in the seventy-seventh form the two-in-one life split, and the link broke, and the \ndrops became separated. And as they divided, they got quite the opposite form, and feeling \nand sex now really appeared... \nAs these two drops have only the impressions, emotions, etc., of previous times, and nothing \nmore, they quickly began to reincarnate. And as they incarnated they got 120 connections, \nor forms, some closely connected and others not so close. And then they united and child \ncame. As only these previous impressions - and nothing more - were there, the first human \nform went up by itself, being pure, and the 120 were drawn up with it. Thus the Circle of \n120 realised itself. So whenever this - Baba - comes down, the 120 come down with him. \nFeeling and emotion are only the creation of mind and energy. Love is the creation of the \nsoul. \n(Baba explained later:) \nThe process of evolution up to the reincarnation point is natural. It goes on systematically \nlike a spiral. All forms are in a circle, and when the two drops united in the (first) human \nform, that was the end of the process of evolution. So it stopped, and the momentum \ndiminished at the seventy-seventh form. And when the momentum finished, then began \nreincarnation. There was no leaving the world before. \nAfter my having become Realised many times, I came down as Avatar with you all \ninnumerable times. Only in the last cycle, 5,329 times. And once more after 450 years. The \nend will be the 5,330th time, although the universe is never finished. So I am both personal \nin impersonal, and in the impersonal, too, I am conscious. The unconscious ocean is Baba, in \nthe conscious drop is me, and also in everyone I experience myself consciously. \n20 April 1933, \nKashmir, \nHM p451-453 \nMembers of my Mandali are of three types. The first group is like milk mixed with salt. The \nsecond is like milk mixed with dirt. The third is like milk and sugar. Milk is comparable to \nlove, service, devotion, obedience, et cetera, attributes which every one of the Mandali has \nfor me. But alongside these qualities there is contrariness in their behavior. I look around at \neach one and find that all are not equal. When I seem to be sad and suffering, some feel \ndeeply for me, some take it lightly or indifferently, thinking that I am the Perfect Master and \ncan withstand all that, and some are of the opinion that I purposely create all these \ncomplications and difficulties that cause me so much strain and suffering. I know well that \nyou all have love, devotion and faith in me, but I behave differently with you because of your \nvarying behaviors. \nYou who are of my Circle should only pay attention to your duties. By creating different \ncircumstances, I afford you the opportunity to serve me. But you spoil the milk by mixing \nsalt or dirt in it when you disobey my instructions. Continue putting sugar in the milk to \nmake me happy - always keeping me happy is to mix sugar in the milk. \n17 June 1935, \nMount Abu, \nLM6 p1964 \nPublic figures, who in spite of all their loud cries and sermons of service on public \nplatforms, at eulogies, and at tributes paid to them by the press and public, all or most of \nthem have their weaknesses and vices, which are buried underneath their public name and \nimage. Compared to these loud speakers, my Mandali are jewels, many of them suffering not \nonly physically but mentally all the time. And mental torture is worse. They are human after \nall. They have a mind, and with it, so long as they are human and imperfect, all its \nweaknesses. They too have many thoughts of lust, for these always react with vengeance \nwhen checked. And not being independently free to act as they please, being under orders \nnot to put these into action, it is a regular torture. Yet they all try to do so, to obey me, even \nduring the prime of life, when these are at full force, and when life is truly to be enjoyed. \nAnd having spent previous years of life in my service and sahavas under strict orders of \nabstinence and austerities, they still have nothing but a blank wall to face for their future, \nwhich they have left entirely in the Master's hands for years, and know nothing except his \nword and assurance that it is all for their good. And there is nothing but abject \ndisappointment as far as material or worldly gains are concerned. Yet they still hold on to \nthe bargain and promise made by me since the beginning, for some great spiritual benefit, of \nwhich they at the moment have not the slightest glimpse. \n29 March 1938, \nto his Western devotees, \nLM8 p3036-3037 \nThere is a difference in the Avatar's or Sadguru's attitude toward their Circles, and toward \nthe general public. The members of the Circle are like the sons of the Master, and the \ngeneral public are like non-family members. For example, if a newsboy turns into a \nmillionaire, he would teach others the ways by which he became so, and tell them that if \nthey followed him, they too would become millionaires. But to his sons he will give the \nriches, not descriptions of how he acquired the riches. \nIn the same way, the Avatar and Sadgurus never explain to members of their Circles the \nways and means of the Path. They just place them right on the Path to God-realisation itself; \nwhile to ordinary people they explain the ways and means to achieve it. The Circle members \ndo not need these explanations, because they are the inheritors of the divine wealth, the \nheirs. When the wealth itself is in hand, what is the necessity for explaining the ways to \nobtain it? \nThere are special rules for my Circle members. I put up with and forgive their serious \nfaults... \n13 February 1940, \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2519 \nApart from the Circle, who are taken to God blindfolded,  there are very few who receive the \ngrace of a Master and who are pushed to even the sixth plane. All this depends mostly on \npast sanskaras. It is very little of this present life which brings one in contact with a Perfect \nMaster. \n24 March 1940, \nLM7 p2539 \nAfter several lives of search, purification, service and self-sacrifice, a soul has the good \nfortune to meet and get connected with a God-realised Master. And after several lives of \nclose connection with the Master, and love and service for the Master, he enters into his \nCircle. \nWhen the Master takes an incarnation for work, he always invariably brings with him all \nwho are in his Circle. Those who have entered into the Circle of a Master are the souls who \nhave, through their efforts, acquired the right (adhikar) of having God-realisation. And \nwhen the exact moment for Realisation arrives, they attain the Realisation through the \ngrace of the Master. \nc.1941, Di v4 p35 \n... It is the greatness of lovers and devotees that they love and adore God and the Guru. Even \nif you, the Mandali, don't feel anything such as this boy* or other devotees have \nexperienced, the very fact that you have given up all and now stay with me, and render \nservice solely out of love, although you do not know me, is enough to prove your greatness, \nwhich I alone see, know and appreciate. \n11 March 1942, \nDehra Dun, \nLM8 p2769 \n*Suloo Meshram, who Baba said loved him deeply \nWhat are the members of my Mandali doing? They are neither doing japa (repeating God's \nname) nor tapa (penance), nor practising any type of yoga.  They have dedicated their lives \nto me, and have been holding firmly to me for a long time. Even yogis cannot do a part of \nthis. The important point in this connection is that they are not only helping me in my cause \nby obeying my instructions, but they are rendering personal and private help to me. And I \nam sure, before Self-realisation, I would not have been able to serve my Master as they are \nserving me. \nBuddhi, or the intellect, is the greatest obstacle in knowledge of the Self. If there is the \nslightest criticising attitude, it is an obstacle. That which is beyond the intellect cannot be \ngrasped intellectually. It would be like trying to trap the wind in an ordinary trap. All my \nMandali are not without brains, though there may be one or two who are not intelligent. If \nthey had no spiritual help, it would be difficult to understand how they have been sticking \nto me for the last twenty-five years. I tell you, it would not have been possible for me to do \nso before Realisation. In the case of the Avatar, before the Avataric knowledge dawns, there \nis infinite restlessness, and on account of this restlessness he cannot stick to anything. \nThe work and services of my devotees are magnificent... Those who are lecturing for me and \nimpressing people about my work are like my tongue. They are in fact my mouthpiece. \nOthers who work for me are like my other limbs. \n24 May 1945, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p3031-3036 \nThe giving up of life in an emotional outburst of the moment is quite cheap compared with \nthe day-to-day carrying out of the Master's instructions through the thick and thin of one's \nlife. Sometimes soldiers of very ordinary calibre can also perform acts of sacrifice and \nheroism under particular circumstances and impulses of the moment. \n23 June 1951, \nJubilee Hills, Hyderabad, \nLM10 p3700 \nI have often said that I have not yet found one who could love me. There are about 220 men \nand women from East and West who have surrendered to me in such a way as to do \nanything I say. It is a fact. For example, Eruch. He is intelligent, has a good heart. If I order \nhim to do anything, he will try 100%, even to cut himself to pieces.   Pendu, Meherjee, \nMandali who are with me since years together, they all are the same. Each of these 220 \nMandali would lay down their lives. What I want to point out is, to surrender is higher than \nto love. And paradoxical as it may seem, to love me is impossible, and to obey me is possible, \nthough very difficult. So to call yourself my workers and yet not to obey is hypocritical... \n...If Mandali advise you, when asked by you, don't take the advice as from me. They will \ndefinitely advise you for the best, because they have been long with me, yet do not take their \nadvice as from me... You can trust them not to mislead you purposely. But after asking them \nfor advice and help, you should also think of it yourself. For after all, Mandali are not Baba... \nLet us be very honest, absolutely honest. Adi has been with me like the few tested Mandali \nfor a long period, and he has been doing office work for twenty years 100%. And even then, \nas I said, no one of my Mandali is Baba. Everyone has got weaknesses and defects. Advice \nyou can have from Adi, but not as from Baba through Adi. \n2 March 1954, \nAndhra, \nAD p116, 120-121 \nEruch Jessawalla asked Baba \"what constitutes the Mandali?\" \nBaba: Those who have been with me for many years, but ask for nothing. They are the \nintimate ones who all along, and even now, are prepared to sacrifice their all for me. One \nwho gives his life to me, who listens to me, who does not ask for any kind of reward, who \ndoes not care about the result, whether he is ruined or prospers, who takes Baba's khushi \n(happiness) as his khushi, but at the same time whose intimacy I also feel, is in the Mandali. \nEruch: Can one call himself Baba's Mandali if he feels he is a Mandali, regardless of the \nnumber of years of connection with you, be it thirty years or only one year? \nBaba: If you find me intimate with you. For example, take Elcha at Dehra Dun. I feel \nabsolutely free with him. But if he is not prepared to sacrifice all, then he is not in the \nMandali. \nEruch: Can a person declare that he is a member of the Mandali? \nBaba: Those who I feel to be in the Mandali are my Mandali. And no one can assert that he is \nin the Mandali. \n1954, \nHamirpur, \nAO p99 \n(Elcha = Eruch D. Mistry) \nAre you all not members of the Mandali? Do you not love me? Why all this talk? What is this \nnew thing you have started now? For example, for the last four years I have been wearing \nthis pair of sandals. The sandals go with me wherever I go. I should also describe the \nqualities of my sandals. \nWho raised this point about the Mandali? There are so many others who are of the Mandali. \nWhat about so many who are not here, but are in the West, East and distant places? Most of \nthem are gems. Are you not all of my Mandali? Is not your love and obedience equally great? \nI do not like pointed individual references to the Mandali members. There are so many \namongst you who are gems. Look at Dr. D., look at his age. He goes out from place to place. \nLook at K.S., how he works and how he has sacrificed. Look at M. Why should I not refer to \nthem and many others among you present here? Why particular mention of some of the \nMandali? I tell you, those who love Baba and tell others of Baba's love are his Mandali. It \nwon't make any difference whether they are near Baba or stay a thousand miles away. \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nLJ p58 \nThe Mandali who have been with me through thick and thin all these years are fully \nprepared, for love of me, to lay down their very lives at...  a sign from me. Yet even they do \nnot love me as I love them. If they did, then they would have become one with my oneness, \nwhich in reality is the oneness of us all. It is love alone which can lift the veil between a \nlover and the beloved. Believe me, you and I remain divided by nothing but the veil of you \nyourself. \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p18 \nAnother version: \nThe Mandali are fully prepared to lay down their lives for me.

    "text": "MARRIAGE \nMeher Baba \nIf one has good moral conduct and leads a pure life without marrying, it is best, because \nmarriage at times creates impediments in one's spiritual life. \nBut the bond of marriage is preferable to leading an immoral, promiscuous lifestyle, with its \nterrible consequences. \nThe bond of marriage should be such that the partners in life never involve themselves with \nany other man or woman. \n8 August 1925, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p748 \nLook at all the fuss and show, and the cost of it, of marriages in nearly all creeds and classes. \nThe purpose of it all is simply to publicise the fact that so-and-so man and woman have \nunited as man and wife, and none else has any similar claim on either of them. Could not \nthis be done simply and cheaply by registration and advertisement? \nAs for the blessings and advice of the priest, which are proportionate to the fatness of the \nfees, what can be said? It all amounts to: not to quarrel, not to separate from each other, \nlove one another and live a long time. These pious sentiments are then sealed with heavy \nwining and dining and many vulgar exhibitions under the very nose of the smiling priest, \nwho pats his pocket where he put the money, and at a convenient moment, still smiling, \nbegs to be excused, and retires - a hired murmurer of prayers, a paid conferrer of blessings. \nAnd sometimes it happens that, with the dying away of the sounds of the feast, if not earlier, \nthe couple begin quarreling. To where have gone the blessings and the prayers? And what \ncan the poor priest do except look grave or laugh and offer more advice? For knowledge is \nnot his share. It is not his time for blessing, but to be blessed with honest sense. \nIt is not bought blessings and ceremonies and feasts that can save us from evil \nconsequences, but our own actions. It is the understanding, love and goodness of each for \neach that alone can make the couple happy, as it is only their selfishness which makes them \nquarrel. All should realise this and stop wasting money on rituals and ceremonies. \nJanuary 1927, \nSW p331-332 \nAnother version LM4 p902 \nIf you marry you incur seven more new births, and it is for this reason that saints and \nRealised Masters advise their devotees to lead an unmarried life. These seven births go on \nmultiplying as you proceed, lifetime after lifetime. For example, 7 x 7 = 49 x 7 = 343 x 7 and \nso on. \nHow many former husbands or wives you have left in your past lives, and how many new \nones you will come into contact with in the future! None of the past husbands or wives do \nyou remember, nor will you know of those to come. Hence, if you insist that you want to \nmarry, marry me. \nA marriage with me means so much regard, affection and love for only me. Such thought and \nremembrance of me demands a great deal indeed, much, much more love than even with \nthe yogis of ancient times. So marry me. Marriage with me means love, peace and bliss. \nOrdinary marriage means jugara (fighting) and a thousand and one worries arising \ntherefrom. \n16 February 1928, \nMeherabad, to a couple \nplanning to marry, \nLM3 p1021-1022 \nQ. They say that woman is a drag on man in his attainment of divine grace. All the saints you \nsee... \nBaba: No, woman can play an important part in the development of divine grace. She is \nman's equal. So long as she is true to herself, all will be well. But when once she surrenders \nto her surroundings, you understand, the function of marriage fails. It is then you have \ndivorces. \nQ. Then the vow of celibacy which the saints undertook... \nBaba: It is unimportant. Some men marry, others may remain single, but a man is not \nspiritually more backward because he has married. A woman by her love can inspire him to \nknow the truth. But she must develop love and not lust. This is the key to happiness. \nApril 1932, \nLondon, to a reporter for the \nLondon Daily Sketch, \nBG p128-129 \nAnother version: LM5 p1565 \nEven the love which expresses through physical desire is good to the extent that it frees one \nfrom the thralldom of personal likes and dislikes, and makes one want to serve the beloved \nabove all other things. \nEvery human relationship is based on love in one form or another, and endures or dissolves \nas that love is eternal or temporal in character. Marriage, for example, is happy or unhappy, \nexalting or degrading, lasting or fleeting, according to the love which inspires and sustains \nit. \nMarriages based on sex-attraction alone cannot endure. They lead inevitably to divorce or \nworse. Marriages, on the other hand, which are based on a mutual desire to serve and \ninspire, grow continually in richness and beauty, and are a benediction to all who know of \nthem. \n1 June 1932, \nBeverly Hills, California, \nMe p100 \nQ. When a young aspirant meets young women he is susceptible to thoughts of lust. On the \nother hand, if he avoids them entirely, he is likely to withhold a great deal of love. Is there \nany way out of this difficulty? \nBaba: Free mixing of the sexes, as in the West, is on the whole good. But if the aspirant feels \nwithin his mind the slightest flutter of impure thoughts, he should stand aside. But he must \nlove, and in order to avoid the arising of impure thoughts, he should keep in mind the \nthought that in the other person he is loving the Master. \nQ. The aspirant must, undoubtedly, eliminate lust and release love. But lust as well as love \nare facts of inner life, that is, modes of consciousness, and cannot be taken as being identical \nwith any specific acts of the physical body. Will the aspirant be wrong if he tries to express \nand develop love, instead of lust, through sex union? \nBaba: If the aspirant thinks that through the sex-act he is expressing love, he is, sadly, \nmistaken. It is lust which prompts him to it. It is not possible to express pure love through \nthe sex-act, because of the clash of impressions involved therein. \nQ. What is your teaching concerning marriage? \nBaba: For an aspirant, celibacy is better than marriage. But if he cannot control himself, he \nshould marry. To pursue a spiritual life, it is much better to marry than to go from flower to \nflower. \nQ. How can the aspirant use marriage for spiritual progress? \nBaba: In the beginning, the aspirant will, in relation to the partner, feel lust as well as love. \nBut he can, with conscious and deliberate cooperation with the partner, gradually lessen the \nelement of lust and increase the element of love, until love becomes utterly pure and free \nfrom lust. But in order to achieve this purpose, he must strictly limit himself to his partner \nin matters of sex. \n1930s, A p50-51 \nA woman told Baba that, because of her desire to see God, she wanted to stop having sex \nwith her husband. Her husband felt differently. Baba told her, \n\"It is better to treat your husband with love and affection, even if you dislike and do not \nwish to indulge in intercourse because of your spiritual aspiration and desire to love God. \n\"It is good to have no sexual desires, but when it comes to a question of duty, you must \nsacrifice a little of your interest to please your husband. \n\"Keep your mind focused toward God, and give your body to your husband. Remember \nSaint Mira's sacrifice and how she suffered. Be like her.\" \n28 October 1934, \nMeherabad, \nLM6 p1919 \nBaba: Nervous? Be rested. \nWoman: I am in love with a church pianist. Is that friendship to be kept up very pure? \nBaba: Where's the harm to keep it up? \nWoman: Catholic law prevents marriage with a man who is divorced. The church is against \nit... that's the conflict. \nBaba: But do you love each other? \nWoman: Yes. \nBaba: Then love is all that matters, if there is no lust. I see no harm in it. Let that love grow, \nso that it makes two souls like one. I will spiritually help you to make this love grow purer. \n1934, \nZurich, Switzerland, \nA p4. \nAlso PM p242 \nA man may discharge his worldly duties and maintain a household with a wife and child. \nBut, at the same time, he should remain detached from all this, come what may. This does \nnot mean that he should be neglectful of his duties toward his near and dear ones, but that \nhe should have no attachments to it at all. \nYou know that a pen is yours and you use it. But if you lose it, you should not care about it; \nyou should remain detached. \nThe meaning of God-realisation is emancipation - freedom from the bondage of maya. But \none has to be in maya to come out of it. So remain in maya, but do not get enmeshed in it. \nKeep away from its tricks and snares. \nFebruary 1934, \nMadras, \nto Sampath Aiyangar, \nLM5 p1860 \nNo two souls united in wedlock can be Realised together simultaneously - never does it \nhappen... \nBecause in the chain of births and deaths, each opposite sex changes simultaneously. That \nis, male becomes female, and female becomes male... \nTwo souls reincarnate together changing their sex for a number of lifetimes, until they drift \napart at that certain point nearest to Realisation. \nThe secrets of life are absolutely unintelligible to the human mind. That is why they are \nnever revealed as they are, but in different methods and shapes. \nLove, real and divine, does not evolve, nor is it realised from temporal love. They are both \nquite different. Human or temporal love at its best cannot be compared to divine love, even \nin the beginning stage. \n1 January 1935, \nLos Angeles, California \nto Karl Vollmoeller, \nLM6 p1942-1943 \nThe world is accustomed to think in terms of opposites. Thus, we often try to fit life into a \nscheme of alternati  ves, such as joy or pain, attachment or repulsion, good or bad, solitude \nor company, indulgence or repression. And in the same way the mind has a tendency to \nthink of marriage and celibacy as alternatives from which there is no escape. \nIt seems as if man must accept one alternative or the other. And yet he cannot \nwholeheartedly accept either alternative, because when he is celibate, he is dissatisfied with \nhis lot, and longingly thinks of the advantages of marriage. And when he is married, he is \nequally dissatisfied with his lot, and longingly thinks of the advantages of celibacy. Thus, in \noscillating from one idea to the other, mind finds no rest. \nIn order to be freed from the clutches of the opposites, the mind must first try to \nunderstand how they are both equally the creation of imagination working under the \ndeluding influence of craving. \nIn celibacy as well as in marriage, craving is present. Celibacy as opposed to marriage \nmeans the mechanical restraint or the repression of sex, whereas marriage means the \nrelease or the indulgence of sex. But both presuppose the crowding of the mind by the \nsanskaras of lust, or the craving for sensation. Craving is therefore the common root of both \nthe opposites of celibacy and marriage. \nThe mind which is restless with desire creates an illusory idea of happiness in the \ngratification of desire - and then, knowing that the soul remains dissatisfied even after \ngratification, it creates an illusory idea of happiness in the mechanical restraint of desire. In \nsearch of freedom and happiness, the mind gets caught up within these opposites, which it \nfinds equally disappointing. And since it does not try to go beyond the opposites, its \nmovement is always from one opposite to the other, and consequently from one \ndisappointment to another disappointment. \nCraving thus falsifies the operation of the imagination, and presents the mind with the \noption between two opposites which prove to be equally deceptive in their promise of \nhappiness. However, in spite of alternate and repeated experience of disappointment in \nboth the opposites, the mind usually does not renounce craving. Because while experiencing \ndisappointment in mechanical restraint, it is easily susceptible to the false promise of \ngratification. And while experiencing disappointment in indulgence, it is easily susceptible \nto the false promise of mechanical restraint. \nIt is only when the mind is awakened by the grace of a Master that it begins internal and \nspontaneous renunciation of craving, which in the course of time leads to abiding peace and \nhappiness. Internal and spontaneous renunciation of craving is as different from mechanical \nrestraint as it is from indulgence. \nMind turns to mechanical restraint because of disappointment. But it turns to internal and \nspontaneous renunciation because of disillusionment or awakening, which comes when it \nexperiences in the Master the quality of life which is free from craving, and which, therefore, \nis not bound by the deceptive opposites... \nThe value of celibacy lies, not in the mechanical restraint, but in the sense of independence \nwhich it gives. But as long as the mind is not altogether free from craving, there is no true \nfreedom. \nIn the same way, the value of marriage lies not in indulgence, but in the sense of unity with \nthe other which it gives. But true union, or the dissolution of duality, is possible only \nthrough divine love, which can never dawn as long as there is in the mind the slightest \nshadow of lust or craving. \nOnly by treading the path of inner and spontaneous renunciation of craving is it possible to \nattain true freedom and union with life, where the duality of the I and you is swallowed up \nin the all-embracing divine love, and where there is neither the mechanical restraint of \ncelibacy, nor the indulgence of marriage, but complete detachment and perfect love. \nThis state of Perfection, in which the Master continuously dwells, may be aptly described as \ncelibacy in marriage, or marriage in celibacy. For while he is freed from ignorance, he is \nunited with God, and while he knows himself to be the single one, he also knows himself to \nbe the one with all. And while he may be said to be a celibate in relation to maya, he may be \nsaid to have been married to Truth. \n1930s? NW p74-78 \nThe question of indulgence or repression arises only when there is craving. The need for \nboth vanishes along with the complete disappearance of craving. When the mind is free \nfrom craving, the mind can no more be moved by the false promises of indulgence or \nmechanical repression. \nHowever, it should be borne in mind that the life of freedom is nearer to the life of restraint \nthan to the life of indulgence, though in quality is is essentially different from both. Hence, \nfor the aspirant, a life of strict celibacy is preferable to the married life, if restraint comes to \nhim easily, without any undue sense of self-repression. But such restraint is, for most \npersons, difficult, and sometimes impossible, and for them the married life is decidedly \nmore helpful than a life of celibacy. For ordinary persons, married life is undoubtably \nadvisable unless they have a special aptitude for celibacy... \nMost persons enter into married life as a matter of course. But marriage will turn into a help \nor a hindrance according to the manner in which it is handled. There is no doubt that some \nof the immense spiritual possibilities are accessible through a married life, but all this \ndepends upon having the right attitude. \nFrom the spiritual point of view, married life will be a success only if it is thoroughly \ndetermined by the vision of Truth. It cannot offer much if it is based upon nothing more \nthan the limited motives of mere sex, or if it is inspired by considerations which usually \nobtain in the partnership of business. It has to be taken as a real spiritual enterprise which \nis intended to discover what life can be at its best. \nWhen the two partners together launch upon the spiritual adventure of exploring the higher \npossibilities of the spirit, they cannot at the outset limit their experiment by any nice \ncalculations concerning the nature and amount of individual gain... \nFor the celibate as well as for the married person, the path of inner life is the same. When \nthe aspirant is drawn by the Truth, he longs for nothing else. And as the Truth increasingly \ncomes within his ken, he gradually disburdens himself of craving. Whether in celibacy or in \nmarriage, he is no longer swayed by the deceptive promises of indulgence or mechanical \nrepression, and he practises internal and spontaneous renunciation of craving until he is \nfreed from the deceptive opposites. \nThe path of Perfection is open to the aspirant whether in celibacy or in marriage. And \nwhether he begins from celibacy or from marriage will depend upon the sanskaras and the \nkarmic ties of the aspirant. He cheerfully accepts the conditions which his past life has \ndetermined for him, and utilises them towards his spiritual advancement in the light of the \nideal which he has come to perceive... \nIf a person is not prepared to undertake the responsibilities of children, there is only one \ncourse which is left for him. He must remain a celibate, and practise strict mental control. \nFor though such mental control is extremely difficult to attain, it is not impossible. \nFrom the purely spiritual point of view, strict celibacy is best. But since it is so difficult, few \ncan practise it. And for those who cannot practise it, the next best course is to marry, rather \nthan fall a prey to promiscuity. Within married life one can learn to control animal passion. \nBut it is bound to be a gradual process, and in cases of failure in practising control, parents \nmust allow nature to take its own course, rather than interfere with it through artificial \nmeans. They must cheerfully welcome the consequences, and be prepared to shoulder the \nresponsibility for the upbringing of children... \nIn the beginning of married life, the partners are drawn to each other by lust as well as love. \nBut they can, with conscious and deliberate cooperation, gradually lessen the element of \nlust and increase the element of love. Through this process of sublimation, lust ultimately \ngives place to deep love. \nBy the mutual sharing of joys and sorrows, the partners march on from one spiritual \ntriumph to another spiritual triumph, from deep love to ever deeper love, till the possessive \nand jealous love of the initial period is entirely replaced by a self-giving and expansive love. \nIn fact, through the intelligent handling of marriage, a person may traverse so much of the \nspiritual Path that it needs only a touch by a Master to raise him into the sanctuary of \neternal life. \nc. 1940, Di v2 p3-13 \nMarriage Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

He said that the loss of this \n- excepting in the relations of man and wife which are based upon mutual love and respect - \nwas a serious matter. Indulgence for its own sake, whether natural or unnatural or in \ndreams, simply increased one's sanskaric load. \n\"'There are people,' he said, 'who say it is natural for the energies of the body to be spent. \nSpent, yes - but in service, not in lust. So the best remedy is to keep the mind engaged in \nlove for God and in service for others.

Baba had told the boys' parents to look out for suitable matches, but the actual \nselection was made by the boys and girls themselves - thus breaking the age-long custom of \narranged marriages. \n\"In the general excitement, it was overlooked that one of the boys was a Christian, and this \nled to a great dispute between both sides; but it was eventually agreed to have the marriage \naccording to that religion. However, later on, the girl's parents pressed Baba for a Hindu 're-\nmarry,' but he would not allow it. Almost the entire village turned out, and Baba provided \nthe wedding feast.\" \nFrancis Brabazon, SW p272 (February 1926, Meherabad) \nA follower of Meher Baba came to see him. He was a Hindu, and regularly performed Hindu \nreligious rituals. He wanted to get married, and hoped Baba would encourage him. Baba \ntold him, \n\"For you, marriage would be a great stumbling block in the Path to God-realisation. But for \nyou to have connection with a woman out of marriage would be the worst thing imaginable. \nYet even marriage will turn out to be a hindrance and a barrier in the Path.\" \n28 June 1926, \nMeherabad, LM3 p818 \n\"Arjun became the father of a son, and Baba asked him, was he going to put on a tea party? \nHe replied that since he had left all his affairs in his (Baba's) hands, Baba should do what he \nthought best. \n\"A general discussion on marriage came up, and Baba said that it was one of the great \nessentials of life, and that was why Buddha, Muhammad, Upasani Maharaj, Tukaram, and \nother Masters were married. Only those Masters who became Realised before the usual \ntime of marriage remained single, like Christ, Shankaracharya, and himself. \n\"Baba asked who among the single Mandali wanted to marry. No one stepped forward. \nFinally he told Naval and Kishan they would have sons.\" \nFrancis Brabazon, \nSW p315-316 (November 1926) \n\"In late January, Manohar Manjirwala came for darshan with his children. His wife had \nrecently died, and he was greatly bereaved. Baba advised him, \n\"'Get married again. You will have a handsome and lucky son. \n\"'But why hurry and worry about a wife? Being married and leading a family life are not \nbinding. It is the mind which needs to be stilled in all situations. \n\"'It is very easy to talk of being free of the family, but very difficult to renounce the world. \nThis is only possible for truly courageous people. So it is better to marry again and give up \nall thought of renunciation. \n\"'Your wife was blessed to have performed my arti when I visited your home.'\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM3 p903 (late January 1927, Meherabad) \nAnother account: \n\"A young todiwala, Manhar, lost his wife, and wanted to renounce the world. Baba told him \nnot to grieve, and that his wife was very fortunate, for she was one of his real devotees, and \nhad performed his arti very fervently only a few days before she died. \n\"Baba advised him to remarry soon, and he would give him a nice and well-favored son. \nMarriage, he said, was no binding at all; it is the mind that has to be kept free, unattached \nand quiet in all conditions. It is very easy (he said) to talk about renunciation, but that is the \nwork of heroes.\" \nFrancis Brabazon, SW p334, Meherabad, January 1927 \n\"Many women have become saints and Masters. Although you are married, still try to \nintensely long for God.\" \nMeher Baba, 3 April 1927, \nAhmednagar, to women at Vyankatesh \nChichorkar's house, LM3 p924 \n\"Desires are harmful both ways, when fulfilled and when not fulfilled. For instance, a person \nhas a desire for sex. Overcome with intense longing, he fornicates with someone of the \nopposite sex and fulfills his desire. What then? After the fornication, he feels dejected. Why \nis this, when his desire has been fulfilled? At first it seems so strange, but there is nothing \nstrange about it. For that is the eventual result of expression of his desire, which brings on \ndisappointment and dejection. \n\"Once a desire is fulfilled, there is another desire that arises ready to be satisfied. When that \ndesire is satisfied, another is there, and so on. It is not easy to escape the clutches of one's \ndesires. Only Perfect Masters can destroy the desires of their devotees, disciples, and those \non whom their grace descends.\" \nMeher Baba, \n12 June 1929, \nArangaon, LM4 p1165 \nFornication: voluntary sexual intercourse between two persons not married to each other \n(Random House Dictionary of the English Language) \n\"Wine is good for both health and the spiritual life. It is an intoxicant and tonic for both. If \nafter drinking wine, thoughts are diverted to spiritual advancement, it is a great push \ntoward the goal. Otherwise it can lead to hell. Wine is such that either it raises you to the \nhighest pinnacle, or makes you fall into the deepest ditch. \n\"The main object of intoxicants in the ancient past was spiritual. Seekers then used not only \nwine, but also hemp, heroin, hashish and opium; so much so that even Qutubs would \nindulge in them (You have heard stories that Sai Baba used to smoke a chillum pipe, and \nUpasani Maharaj smoked beedis). But eventually during those times, ordinary people \nindulged in these intoxicants for the wrong reasons. They could not understand their \nproper use, and the effects of the intoxication diverted their thoughts to carnal desires - \nworst of all to lust, the greatest obstacle in the Way. \n\"In the spiritual Path, lust is the greatest obstacle. Even the thought of fornication should \nnot enter the mind. That is why I tell you, 'Keep your langoti tight,' which means to have no \nlustful thoughts, do no lustful actions, and do not touch or even look at a woman. \n\"Lust is so forceful that even looking at a woman can start a man thinking about sex; and \nthinking leads to action. Compare the love between a child and his mother. The child plays \nin her arms and touches her without creating the least thought of lust. But the slightest \ntouch between the father and mother may arouse lustful thoughts in them.\" \nMeher Baba, September 1929, Isfahan, Persia \nto his men Mandali, LM4 p1227 \nlangoti = loincloth \nBaba asked each of the unmarried men Mandali to promise never to touch any woman \nlustfully. He asked the married men Mandali to promise not to touch any woman other than \ntheir wives lustfully. Then he explained, \n\"Lust is not bad. Because of this lust, you have been born as human beings. It is due to this \nvery lust that you will turn from men into God. But even if lust is there in you, don't put it \ninto action. From the spiritual point of view, lust is the worst possible weakness. The real \nhero is he who successfully fights it. \n\"Fornicating with a woman who isn't your wife is one of the worst possible sins. What had \nto happen has happened; but from now on, beware of carnality. Follow my orders and stay \naway from lust. What lasting pleasure can one derive from such stinking parts? It can \ndestroy your spirit and character, as well as infect the body. \n\"I know each and every thing, but knowing everything, I keep on watching. Perhaps you \nmight think, 'Why doesn't Baba save us from committing sins, despite knowing everything?' \nBefore you do any wrong action, I already know that you are going to do it. Then why do I \nnot prevent you? It is my secret. \n\"The secret of my work is, though I know everything, I do not interfere. The fact is, you \nshould have this lust, but you should do your utmost not to fall prey to it. You should put up \na fierce fight, and though defeated a thousand times, you should again be ready to continue \nto fight the lust. \n\"Were I to wish it, I could destroy the lust in you in no time. But what would be the use of \ndestroying it? Inevitably I will destroy it. In the meantime, continue on with the battle inside \nyourselves. This is the law. It is necessary. Then joy will come in defeating lust. Without a \nstruggle, there is no pleasure in fighting. The real pleasure lies in success after so many \ndefeats. Wars won without obstacles, without sacrifices and untiring effort afford no \npleasure. This should be a life and death fight. Lust is there to be fought. It is a lifelong \nstruggle. It will be a conflict in you till the end of your days. It should be there to fight you, \nand you should always be alert and ready for battle, to kill. \n\"He who has love for and faith in me will try doubly hard to obey me. If you touch any \nwoman, tell me immediately; this is one remedy. Another is to think that in your last birth \nyou were a woman and had connections with a man; now you are a man and you want \nconnections with a woman. You have had enough satisfaction in previous births. What is to \nbe had by more lust? \n\"Foremost you should try to get rid of lust, as all other vices are on account of it. For \ninstance, if a parrot's throat is cut, it dies. But if its wings are clipped, it does not die; after \nsome time the feathers of the wings grow back. Lust can be compared to the parrot's head. \nTherefore when lust is still present and we conquer other evils, such as anger, the evils \nagain revive - everything rises out of the head. But if lust is killed once and for all, every \nother evil is also destroyed. You have to cut off its head. \n\"Yet in truth, lust is necessary for evolution. It starts developing in the vegetable forms. \nWith the increase in lust, there is advancement in evolution, since lust means energy. And \nwith the increase in energy, consciousness expands. \n\"But these are points on this path which you will never understand. There are thousands of \npoints thinner than hair. Remember, it is no easy thing to eradicate sanskaras gathered \nduring birth after birth, and lust is the hardest of all sanskaras. But be heroes and fight lust; \nyou will defeat it. The real pleasure is to fight it and not succumb to it. Knowing this, I let it \nremain, but I will destroy it in you when the right time comes. Until then, go on fighting, and \nnever give up. \nMeher Baba, 19 October 1929, Isfahan, Persia \ninstructions to his men Mandali (disciples), LM4 p1232-1233 \n\"I must ask all aspirants to remember once and for all, that if they are desirous of rapid \nprogress and quick enlightenment, they should live up to the following four laws: \n1. If possible, observe celibacy. If already married, keep as little sexual intercourse with \nyour partner as possible. Consider, if you are a man, all other women as your sisters; if you \nare a woman, all other men as your brothers. \n2. Avoid all animal food, except milk and the products of milk. Don't partake of even eggs. \n3. Avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea is not an intoxicant, provided it is weak.  But \nbe moderate in your habit of tea drinking. \n4. Curb yourself, and never give way to anger. Whenever you fly into a passion, you contract \nred sanskaras, which are the worst of all.\" \nMeher Baba, \nMs 2:2 p8 (February 1930) \nThe following is an article that appeared in the Meher Gazette in the early 1930s. No author \nwas named. Apparently it was later rewritten and used as part of the discourse 'The \nSanctification of Married Life' (Di 7th ed. p104-109).",

    "text": "MASTS \nMeher Baba \nAll masts are intoxicated with God. They are intoxicated by divine love. \nWhen a normal person is intoxicated by alcohol or drugs, he enjoys this sensation so long as \nthe intoxicant is in sufficient concentration in his physical tissues. A drunkard feels happy, \ncares not for anyone or anything, and has one dominant sensation, of drunkenness, in which \nthe past, present or future have practically no meaning. \nBut as soon as the ordinary intoxication passes away, the drunkard suffers the reverse, the \nhangover. Stimulated physical intoxication is inescapably temporary, because it is limited \nby the very stimulant itself, the conditions of the environment, the cost of the stimulant, and \nthe resilience of one's condition. \nNow, a person who is God-intoxicated experiences the same sensation that a drunkard \nenjoys, and cares for no one and nothing, in proportion to the extent of his inner \nintoxication. The vast difference is, the mast's intoxication is continual, that it may increase \nbut can never decrease, and that it has no harmful physical or mental reaction. It is an inner \nstate of permanent and unalloyed intoxication, independent of anything external. The \nprincipal sensation of a mast is this permanent enjoyment of divine intoxication. \nThe creation is full of bliss, and the mast enjoys this bliss, and thereby becomes intoxicated \nto an almost unlimited extent, virtually consuming him and absorbing him, and thereby \nmaking the world around him vanish. Absorbed in God, such a person is continually \nabsorbed in thinking about God, and with that comes, like a bolt, pure love, consuming him \nfurther in a state of divine intoxication. \nLM6 p2031 \n... Masts are not insane or mad in the ordinary sense. Masts are desperately in love with God, \nor consumed by their love for God. \nMasts do not suffer from what may be called a disease. They are in a state of mental \ndisorder because their minds are overcome by such intense spiritual energies that are far \ntoo much for them - forcing them to lose contact with the world, shed normal human habits \nand customs and civilised society, and live in a state of spiritual splendor but physical \nsqualor. \nThey are overcome by an agonising love for God, and are drowned in their ecstasy. Only the \ndivine love embodied in a Perfect Master can reach them. \nLM6 p2035 \nHow does it happen that some men and women become masts? \nThere are those who have become masts whose minds have become unbalanced through \nunceasing dwelling upon thoughts of God, so that they neglect all normal human \nrequirements. \nThere are those whose minds have become unbalanced by sudden contact with a highly \nadvanced spiritual being. \nThere are those who have sought spiritual experience and have met a crisis from which they \ndo not recover. \nWhat characterises all masts is their concentration upon the love of God. \nLM6 p2031 \nNo ordinary man can tell whether one man is a mast and another man is mad without the \ndivine authority of a Perfect Master. However, the unmistakeable quality that masts possess \nis their abilty to make one happy in their company. Whereas in the company of a mad \nperson one feels depression and sadness. \nLM7 p2435 \nThese men may be called Yoga-brashtas. Apart from the Circle, who are taken to God \nblindfolded, there are very few who receive the grace of a Master and who are pushed to \neven the sixth plane. All this depends mostly on past sanskaras. It is very little of this \npresent life which brings one in contact with a Perfect Master. These souls you see here had \nbeen on the Path in their past lives, but were entirely lost as Yoga-brashtas, and became \nspiritually dazed. Among many examples, one man held on to the fruit of a tree for four \nyears, remaining in the same position until a Master came and gave him experience. so that \nhe released his hold on the fruit and branch he had been holding. \n(One of the Mandali asked how masts are able to withstand physical hardships) \nBaba: All of you have three bodies, Gross, Subtle and Mental. Ordinarily everyone uses the \nfirst two, Gross and Subtle, for experiencing the Gross and Subtle worlds, the former in the \nawake state and the latter in the dream state. After a soul is spiritually advanced and is \nstationed on the spiritual planes, he assumes a body which is called Karana sharir (Mental \nbody). \nWhen in this state, the soul has immense powers in proportion to the stage of advancement \nwhich he has attained. The power itself sustains the physical body, even in the hardest \nstrains and trials. That is how, even oblivious to the world and their own physical needs, \nthey keep living as fresh and strong as ever. Otherwise an ordinary man would drop the \nbody even under a thousandth part of the strain on the physical body they experience. \nMaterial happiness is a millionth shadow of the true divine bliss. \n24 March 1940, \nLM7 p2539 \nThe aspirants who get launched on the mast line find themselves propelled by an \nirresistible impulsion in the form of a yearning to realise God as the divine beloved. The \npsychic journey of masts is a mysterious flight from darkness to light, from ignorance to \nknowledge, from a sense of isolation and frustration to the experience of fulfilment, through \na complete merging in the divine beloved. \nEven in the initial stages, those who are on the path of masts get intoxicated by glimpses of \nGod as the beloved. As the mast advances on the inner planes, he gets more and more God-\nintoxicated, and his yearning to be united with the divine beloved becomes so acute and \nirresistible that it gradually takes him beyond the domain of mind. \nDuring the process of transcending the mind, the mental makeup of the mast is subjected to \nso much disturbance and upheaval that he is unable to use his mind in the ordinary way. To \nall appearances he is like a madman. The way in which he sits, talks or eats, and his general \ndemeanor, are so far removed from what is most current in the world that common people \nvery often take him to be insane. \nThe mast invites upon himself a tumultuous overturning of the ingredients of his ego-mind. \nThese far-reaching and wide-spreading psychic disturbances upset all his normal \nexpressions; and those who have no direct insight into the working of his mind may mistake \nhim for one who is stark mad... \nMasts are God-intoxicated souls. The glimpses of divinity that they get are accompanied by a \njoy that breaks through any type of sordid composure. One state of unbalanced exaltation is \nreplaced by another state of unbalanced exaltation. The divine intoxication of the elixir of \nthe liberating love of God admits of different degrees. \nThe mast, with a feeling of uncontrollable happiness, plies through the unchartered planes, \nwhich open themselves to him, until finally, he is drowned in the unlimited bliss of an \nultimate merging in the divine beloved. Only in the end is his lost balance finally re-\nestablished, for not until all obstructive factors in the journey are successfully overcome can \nthe lost balance of consciousness be restored. \nIn spite of the fact that many masts lose their balance while traversing the path of the inner \nlife, they are often capable of rendering effective service to other aspirants less advanced \nthan themselves. Masts are completely oblivious of worldly considerations and values; but \nthey are very sensitive to the spiritual needs of those who come in touch with them. Masts, \nbecause they are consciously stationed on the higher planes, can give aspirants just that \ntype of occult help that is necessary... \nBecause of his being stationed on the inner planes, which are free from the limitations and \nhandicaps of the Gross world, a mast can be, and often is, in contact with a far greater \nnumber of souls than is possible for an ordinary person. Mast mind is a nucleus of conscious \nformations, with innumerable and far-reaching links. A mast can therefore be a more \neffective agent for spiritual work than the most able persons of the Gross world. The mast \nmind is also often used directly by the Master as a medium for sending his spiritual help to \ndifferent parts of the world. \nVery often when the Master is helping a mast, he is also helping the world through him at \nthat very time. When a mast thus surrenders his mind for the work of the Master, he is, in \nfact, getting closer to the Master as Truth. He is being Perfected far more rapidly than would \nhave been the case if he had avoided such surrender. In a thousand ways, the Master makes \nan irresistible appeal to the inmost being of masts, and awakens in them the undying spring \nof creative action. Those who were derailed from the normal line of life are thus restored to \nunimpeachable sanity and to a wholeness of outlook. The Master makes them spiritually \nPerfect in his own image. \nbefore 1948? W p6-11 \nIf I really like anything, I like two things -  masts and children. I like masts for their strength, \nand children for their helplessness. The fire of love is very terrible indeed, and masts \npresent a challenge - of this terrible fire of love - to God, the beloved. \nAbdul Ghani: Why do so many masts choose dirty and insanitary surroundings, and how is it \nthat their health isn't affected? \nBaba: Masts, because of the terrible fire of their love, present a challenge to the beloved, and \nthis challenge - that the beloved should manifest himself - is always accompanied by heroic \nefforts to achieve total self-elimination or egolessness; efforts that may take many forms. To \nlive in dirty surroundings, such as in or near a latrine or a urinal, is one way of utterly \nforgetting one's bodily existence. And the beauty of it is that when the body is utterly \nneglected or forgotten - because the consciousness is aware only of love for the divine \nbeloved - it does not deteriorate, but takes care of itself automatically. \nThe minds of ordinary people are constantly busy looking after their bodies, but they find \nthat, in spite of taking every kind of precaution and care, deterioration can never be avoided \naltogether. Kabir said, \nTan tajye tan rahe, tan rakhe tan jae; \nYehi achamba hamne dekha, mada kalko khae. \nDiscard the body, it remains; preserve the body, it goes; \nAnd so the astounding fact emerges that the (uncared for) corpse eats up death. \nIt is not given to everybody to be a lover of God. Such lovers are so consumed in the fire of \nlove that they are not conscious of their stage of spiritual progress, and they do not have any \nthought of union with God. They simply 'enjoy' the torture of love, and long for more and \nmore of it. These lovers don't have any thoughts about their separation from the beloved, \nor, as I have already told you, any thoughts of union with him. They are resigned to the state \nin which they find themselves, and when their resignation reaches its climax, it is the \nbeloved who seeks union with them. Hafez says, \nFiraq-o-wasl che khahi, \nraza-e-dust talab. \n\"Separation and union are none of your business. \nSeek only to resign yourself utterly to the will of the beloved.\" \n1949, Wo-b p22-24 \nAbout 70 miles from Satara, there is one mast called Dhondibua. I like him very much. He is \nvery healthy, he doesn't wear anything or want anything. Even if you want to give him \nsomething, he will not take it. \nAlthough he does not wear anything, he doesn't feel cold. In the winter, even when it is \nraining, he sits there in the same position as we find him in summer. I have been there \nseveral times by day and by night, and found him always in the same position. I go there and \ncomfort him, kiss his feet and caress him. He sits near me, and the mast feels very delighted, \nvery happy to be near me. He remains happy; he is like a child; but he knows that all this \nworld is nothing but an illusion. He does not want anything. \nIt is our wants that bind us. We want something, and so we get bound. When we truly do not \nwant anything, we are like emperors. We are everything, therefore we do not want \nanything... \n22 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p29-30 \nMasts Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

As far as countries outside \nAsia are concerned, there are, with the exception of  Egypt, no masts in any other part of the \nworld.

    "text": "MEDITATION \nMeher Baba \nWhat is meditation? Generally the word is used to express particular mental efforts and \nexercises in connection with religious and spiritual ideas. But it is taken recourse to by \nmany a person in the everyday life of the world. Before doing anything, one has to think \nabout it. In other words, one has to meditate on the intended action. \nThe thinking or meditation may, in worldly life, last for hours together, or only for a fraction \nof a minute, but it has to be taken consciously or subconsciously, intentionally or \nunintentionally, before anything can be done or brought about. \nNow just consider that if thinking or meditation is necessary in achieving Gross results, how \nnecessary it must be in reaching the spiritual subtleties that lead to Self-realisation. But for \nthe latter purpose, the thinking is to be organised on the principle of Truth, which is \noneness, in contrast with the universe, which is apparently based on manifoldness. \nThinking is supposed by worldly people to be the process that leads only to manifestation of \nexternal force, which is displayed in a Gross action. But such is not the case. Just as even a \nrandom thought can manifest force in the shape of a bodily action, meditation, or deep and \nproperly organised thinking, produces a force of its own which is very useful to the spiritual \naspirant. The manifestation of such force produced through deep and methodical thinking \nmay not become evident immediately or in a short time in every case, but meditation is \nbound to bear fruit in the long run. \nThere are many methods of spiritual meditation. The following six are the most important. \n1. For those who are inclined to think of the impersonal aspect of the Almighty, i.e. \nImpersonal God, it is advisable to retire into solitude, and taking a comfortable seat, begin to \ncontemplate on him thus: 'God is one. God is infinite. God is everywhere. God is beyond \neverything.' Then they should bring the immeasurable space commonly known as the sky to \ntheir mind's eye, and begin to concentrate on the idea of the Impersonal God across this \nimaginary background of the blank and unlimited sky for as long a time as possible. \n2. One should sit for meditation in the same way as shown in the first example. But the line \nof thought in this method must be as follows: \"God is true. All else is false. This world and all \nthat is seen and perceived is a dream, a mirage, an unreal phenomenon. God is living within \nmy own self as the soul of my soul.\" After contemplating these thoughts for some time, one \nmust turn one's attention to the heart. Imagine a flame as one's own atman (soul) to be \nthere, and concentrate as much and as long as possible on this imaginary flaming spot in the \nheart. \n3. The line of thought to be followed in this kind of meditation (the other preliminary \nconditions to be the same as in the first two methods) is this: \"I am not this body. I am not \nfinite. I am the self. I am eternal.\" Following some contemplation in this way, one must \nsuddenly close the two external eyes as tightly as it is comfortably possible to do, and then \nmentally gaze intently upon the centre of the forehead from inward as much and for as long \nas possible, avoiding all other thoughts, whether high or lowly, during this concentration. \n4. This is at once a very simple and very difficult kind of meditation. All that one has to do is \nto retire into solitude and sit in a comfortable position, with both the external eyes closed, \nand try to keep the mind a blank. One has neither to think about God, nor about the devil, \nneither about immortality nor about eternity, neither about the existence of the world nor \nabout its non-existence. In short, in this meditation one must try to remain mentally blank \nthroughout the sitting, for as long a period as possible. \n5. One should sit aside in solitude, close the eyes and contemplate and mentally say and \nreiterate this: 'God is my beloved. I am his lover. I want union with my beloved, the Lord, the \ngreat God.' Following this process for awhile, one should begin to repeat mentally any one \nof the names of the Almighty in any language, but in such a way that half of the name must \nbe pronounced (of course mentally) while inhaling the breath, and half of it to be \npronounced while exhaling the breath. While carrying on this reiteration rhythmically, one \nshould try to concentrate all attention on the reiteration of the name only. \n6. One who is inclined to think of the personal aspect of the Lord, i.e. Personal God, must sit \nwith one's soul for one's companion in a quiet spot, close the eyes, then try to bring before \none's mind's eye the whole face of any Prophet, God-incarnate or Sadguru of the past or the \npresent age, and concentrate on it as long as possible. In order to facilitate the bringing of \nthe features of any Perfect Master to one's mind's eye, his portrait must be gazed at deeply \nbefore closing the eyes in meditation. \nWherever and whenever possible, one should select a quiet and solitary spot on or around a \nhill or mountain, or by a bank of a river, for sitting in meditation. Failing this, one should \nretire into a room all alone, and keep the door closed during meditation. \nIt is unnecessary to lay down hard and fast rules regarding the posture. Any sitting posture \nwhich one finds most convenient should be adopted. But once it is adopted, one must stick \nto it and sit in the same way daily. Where there is a need of mental reiteration of the name \nof God, one must select any one name and adhere to it daily. Therefore the most comfortable \nsitting (not reclining) position and the most appealing name should be carefully selected \nonce for all. \nThere is no length of time that can be called too long for any of the meditations, and every \nhour of the night and day is suitable for any meditation. But the best period for meditation \nis the early hours of the morning, 4 to 7 am. It is preferable, though not quite necessary, to \ntake a bath before sitting in meditation. \nNow which of the methods is the best one? It is not the method, but the force that one would \nuse behind a method that counts. The saying, 'One man's food is another man's poison,' \napplies just as much to meditation as to gastronomy. It would be foolhardy to say that this \nor that particular kind of meditation is the best. That which suits one's own inclination, or \nthat which appeals most to one, is the best kind of meditation for that one. The question of \nsuccess depends on one's own self. Purity counts as much as perseverance, and devotion as \nmuch as determination. \nThere is no question about the benefits of meditation. The chief of them are the following: \n1. One who meditates with sincerity may sooner or later become free from the clutches of \nmaya and be drawn to the truth of God. \n2. If, along with sincerity, meditation is practised with regularity, and for a sufficiently long \ntime, it is capable of making one's mind pure and permanently inclined to the divine path. \n3. The third advantage of meditation lies in the fact that if the meditation is very deep and \nintense, it is likely to produce the state of yoga samadhi. Though yoga samadhi has nothing \nto do with Nirvikalpa samadhi and must not be confused with spiritual Perfection, an \naspirant is likely to derive some benefit from it. \n4. But the greatest advantage of meditation is that which lies in a chance for direct God-\nrealisation. Yes, it is not impossible to get the Nirvikalpa samadhi, Hakikat, the complete \nrealisation of the state 'I am God,' through meditation. But it is possible, provided that the \nmeditator has come under the influence of a living Perfect Master, has a pure and spotless \ncharacter, and is possessed of dogged determination that knows no defeat, even if it comes \nto the question of giving up one's very life in the cause. With these qualities, one must \nmeditate without any other object in view save that of becoming one with the Almighty. \nLet it be borne in mind that there should be no limit to, or a particular fixed period only, for \nmeditation. If meditation cannot be continued throughout the waking state without a break, \nit must be as long as possible. The intensity of meditation is in proportion to the longing for \nthe goal. \nEvery hour, every minute, one must crave for God as a drowning man craves for life. The \nlonging for God brings about extreme unrest, a kind of mind-crushing torture, and this \nmind-crushing torture must be so strong that no thoughts except those of God enter the \ndevotee's mind. This intense longing is very rare in this matter-ridden age. In order to \ngenerate this longing, the help of a Perfect Master is required in most cases. The grace of a \nGod-realised Master works wonders, but one must, so to say, extort this grace from him. \nBe it noted that meditation, or anything done in the cause of Truth, never goes in vain. It is, \nas already said, bound to bear fruit sooner or later. \n1920s? Aw 17:2 p1-3 \n1. Go to bed at 9 pm and get up at 4 am. \n2. From 4 to 5 am, answer nature's call, attend to ablutions, etc. \n3. From 5 to 6 am, be absorbed in devotion to God in the manner to be explained by me... \nThe main object of asking you to follow this new program is to keep you awake in the early \nhours of the morning, especially between 4 and 5 am. From the spiritual point of view, this \nis the most valuable and important time of the day. The important prayers in every religion \nand the practices of all advanced yogis take place during this hour. In fact, from the yogic \npoint of view, it is imperative to be awake in the early hours of the morning. Although I am \nnot going to ask you to follow any religious or yogic practice, as this order is quite apart \nfrom both, I simply want you to keep awake in these hours. \nI have already explained to you that besides the viewpoints of religion, study, meditation \nand yoga, the early hours are important from the spiritual point of view as well. It was \nbetween these hours that Babajan gave me the experience of Truth, and it was also at this \ntime that Upasani Maharaj brought me up out of the Ocean. And it will be between these \nhours that the Circle, too, will attain Realisation. \nBut now the question arises as to how to pass the time after getting up so early. Certainly \nnot in lolling about or playing cards, draughts or chitchatting. It is not becoming for us to do \nsuch things as we are following the Path. So the best way of passing the time will be this: \nfrom 4 to 5 am, all should attend to the daily necessities and take cold baths. Between 5 and \n6 am, all should engage themselves in repeating prayers such as namaz for Mohammedans, \nsadra-kusti for Parsis, puja for Hindus, and devote the major portion of the time to \nrepeating the name of God according to your respective religion - Allah, Ram or Yezdan. \nThis repetition is to be done mentally, while sitting in one fixed position. Although the \nrepetition is to be carried on in the mind, without moving the tongue or lips, beware that \nyour eyes do not close. This is one of the yogic practices. For a fakir, it is unnecessary to \nclose either his eyes, nose or mouth. Nor is it necessary for him to follow religious rituals or \nother practices. \nOnce you sit down, stick to that position without changing until the bell rings for breakfast \nat 6 am. Keep repeating the divine name in your mind with a free heart and without \nthinking of the time. \n28 September and 2 October 1922, \nto Baba's men disciples \nManzil-i-Meem, Bombay, \nLM2 p412-413 \n(Abbas Ali asked Meher Baba how he could traverse the spiritual Path) \nBaba: Think of me every day for five minutes only, at any time of the day. Of course the best \ntime would be at five in the morning, when I remain almost everywhere. This little \nbeginning of a mere five minutes will also be your first step on the spiritual Path. Once you \nget interested in and attuned to the thought of God, you will have a constant urge to think of \nhim for a certain period every day. It is sincere thought that I want. No amount of prayer \nand chanting would be of any value if done as a ritual. These five minutes of thought, \nmeditation or concentration on God or the Master are a thousand times better than any \nprayer. God wants love, pure sincere love. He does not want to hear bombastic, jaw-\nbreaking words and shlokas from the shastras and passages from the Avesta... \nTake one name sincerely, lovingly, devotedly for a few minutes without the thought of \nanything else, and that is worth more than hours of mechanical prayers... Instead of wasting \nyour time on religious discussions, reading and listening to doctrines and dogmas of \ndifferent religions, love God and think of God. Meditation, concentration, and the creation of \na feeling of love in the heart are the essence and substance of all religions. All else is illusion. \n7 February 1928, \nMeherabad, \nBG p1-3 \nMeditation and concentration should be as natural as a lizard concentrating on its prey, \noblivious to everything else. Its concentration is so one-pointed that it only waits to pounce, \nwith no other thought except the hunt, until it has caught its prey. \n30 June 1928, \nToka \nto Meredith Starr, \nLM3 p1064 \nDon't think of union or realisation, only love. Try to love me by meditating on me. Leave all \nother thoughts behind. There is a saying in Persian, 'A thousand kings and emperors like \nJamshed and Kaikhushru are slaves before a Qutub (Perfect Master).' \n16 August 1928, \nToka, \nto Dara Hansotia, a young boy, \nLM3 p1077 \nOne day Meher Baba gathered all the Prem Ashram boys and asked whether they were \nhaving any problems meditating at night and early in the morning. Many replied that they \nwere not. One boy, Bhiwa, began to cry. Baba questioned him, and he replied, 'While \nmeditating I don't see your physical form. Many thoughts assail me.' Baba explained: \nThe mind is a terrible thing. It may be called a curse. Its business is to think and think, the \nmore so when we do not wish to think of a particular person or thing. For instance, when \nyou sit down for meditation or concentration on the Guru or beloved God, other worldly \nthoughts of a thousand and one kinds, of which ordinarily you would not have dreamed, are \nsure to rush into your mind. Thoughts always creep in with their continuous onslaughts, for \nit is the business of the mind to think, think and think. But the real thinker and meditator is \nhe who would not pay attention to these thoughts and would go on meditating on the image \nof his worship, even amidst the strongest attacks. This intervention of other ideas is not a \nsin or a defect or even a mistake of the sadhak (aspirant). These thoughts do and will come \nas long as that terrible mind is there. The sadhak has only to persist strenuously to drive \naway these as much as he can, and think of the beloved, God. He should not give up \nmeditation or feel disturbed or disappointed by these attacks. \nYou need not worry or cry that you cannot love when you cannot meditate due to other \nthoughts disturbing you. For don't you get up from your sweet sound sleep at midnight with \nthe idea of doing meditation? That is half the work done, sacrificing your sweet sleep for \nmeditation of your own accord, without any compulsion. Do you not try to sit down for \nhours until morning to meditate on me when others are in sound sleep? This is three-\nfourths of the work done. Now, only one-fourth is left, that is thinking of only one thing. And \ntry to do that. If you are successful, all right. If not don't worry. Three-fourths of the work \nhas been done by your waking up and trying to sit for hours in meditation. It is no fault of \nyours if you do not get the image before your eyes. Persevere and persist in your efforts. Do \nnot be discouraged and give up the effort. Do not throw away the sitar because it is hard to \ntune. Try to adjust and tune each string persistently, with the firm intent of making the \ninstrument work. Similarly, try to catch outside thoughts by the ear and throw them out. \nSuppose there are innumerable mosquitoes swarming around, and some start biting you at \nnight. What would you do to get rid of this annoyance? Would you just sit there and cry? No, \nyou would at once get a mosquito net. You would resort to a remedy, and it eventually \nwould have the desired effect. Even though the mosquitoes would come in hordes  at first, \nyou would not feel disturbed, for they would almost all be outside the curtain, though a few \nmight have come inside the net. Likewise, deal with all these thoughts. They, like \nmosquitoes, are sure to come and annoy you, but you have to put up a curtain of thoughts \nabout me by letting my divine image be present before your mind's eye. Meditate on me so \nthat the other thoughts automatically stop pestering your mind. Let the mosquito net of \nmeditation on me save you from being bitten by your thoughts. \nTo bring my image before your mind's eye, think of me in my various physical activities: \ngoing here and there, discoursing, giving darshan, kissing and embracing the boys, reclining \non my seat, listening to records, etc. And while you will thus see me in my activities, an \nimage will surely come before your eyes. No sooner than you get this scene, let it not escape, \nbut have a firm hold on it in your mind and concentrate on it with all your affection. Thus \nyour meditation on my various activities will lead you to a concentration on my form, and \nyou will then sit for hours concentrating on it. Remember what I explained, call to me and \nkeep me in mind, and then meditate on my movements, gestures, facial expressions and \nactivities, whatever you remember. If thoughts interrupt, let them. Do not pay any heed. I \nwill teach some of the selected boys and a few of the Mandali the methods of meditation. It \nshould be done quite aloof from everyone. Meditation should not be a troublesome burden \nor boring. It should give joy and be continued. (Baba demonstrated three sitting postures \nfor meditation) When I was Jesus, I showed these methods to a thief... \nThere is a great difference between a yogi's meditation and sincere meditation on infinite, \nimpersonal God or the Guru, infinite God in person. A yogi's meditation ends in samadhi, \nwhile meditation done out of love ends in union. A yogi's meditation ends where love's \nactivity begins. \nto the boys of the Prem Ashram \nAugust? 1928, Toka, \nLM3 p1081-1084 \nFor proper meditation, the stomach should be light. \n18 October 1928, \nToka, \nLM3 p1111 \nBaba told Rustom, \n'It is your choice. You may serve me or meditate on me.' Rustom replied that he preferred \nservice. \nLater, Baba explained to the Mandali and boys about meditation: \n'Meditate on me to such an extent as to forget everything else. Be merged in me. \n'Pleader, though he is fasting and meditating, is still not merged in me. \n'Meditate spontaneously - like the inhalation and exhalation of your breath, which goes on \nautomatically - like the tick, tick, tick of a clock. \nWhile sitting, eating, drinking, studying - amidst every activity - meditate on me naturally. \nMeditation with the help of mercy leads to the Path; with the help of the Master, to samadhi. \nBut without grace, such meditation is not possible. \n5 November 1928, \nToka, \nLM3 p1114-1115 \nOnce an uncle and his nephew, who were both very stubborn and obstinate, came home and \nfound a delicious sweet ladoo on the table. Both wanted it and quarreled over who should \nhave it. In the end, they decided that whatever happened, whoever spoke first would lose \nthe sweet. They sat down opposite each other, and neither spoke for hours and hours. \nThe aunt, knowing their stubborn natures, took everything out of the hut and set fire to it. \nBut neither moved. All the while they stared at the sweet ladoo. But when the fire reached \nthem, the nephew could stand it no longer. Screaming, he fled the house. Immediately, the \nuncle picked up the ladoo and popped it into his mouth. \nYou should be like the uncle, and totally concentrate on me while meditating, without \ngetting drowsy in the least. \n8 November 1928, \nToka, \nto the boys of his school, \nLM3 p1115 \nQ. While meditating, whose name should we remember? Some say Ram, some say Krishna, \nand some utter the name of God - Paramatma or Ishwar. Which is best? \nBaba: Remember anyone's name, either Ram, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha or God. \nBut how are you going to remember God's name? While remembering Ram, Krishna, or any \nof the other Prophets, you can bring his image before your mind's eye, but what about God? \nMere remembrance of the name has no meaning. It should be done with one-pointed \ndevotion, with a mental picture of God before you. If you have his image before you in any \nform, it becomes easy. How can you concentrate thinking only of God? You must have some \nsuitable image of an Avatar or Sadguru before you. With a wandering mind, even if you go \non saying 'Ram Ram Ram' like a parrot for twelve years, it has no value. If you have a Guru, \nkeep his image before you. This is best. \nQ. I find it difficult to concentrate. Please bless me and enable me to do so. \nBaba: I will see to it. While sitting in remembrance, concentrate on me. Keep my image \nbefore your eyes. If you do this, I will see to the rest. \nDhulia, \nJuly 1929, \nLM4 p1172-1173 \nMeditation, repetition of God's name, and spiritual practices in themselves have no \nmeaning. While meditating, any thought comes. Compared to these, my service and my \nsahavas are better, for they contain the seed of love, and only love is required. \n11 February 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1268 \nEvery morning, very early, spare only five minutes for this. Seek a place aloof and alone and \ntry to meditate, thinking 'God is one, he is everywhere, and there is nothing but him.' Do this \nfor only five minutes daily. I will see that you experience something. You will see some light, \nand then you will be satisfied and proceed on the Path. \nJuly? 1930, \nto Muhammad Iqbal, \non a train from Lahore to Amritsar, \nLM4 p1323 \nQ. What should I do? \nBaba: Meditate on the highest ideal. That is love. I will help you. \n26 September 1931, \nLondon, \nLM4 p1431 \nQ. Any instructions of something to do every day? \nBaba: After washing your face in the morning, meditate on me for five minutes. Meditate \nalone, undisturbed and isolated. I will guide you spiritually, not by words. You will feel my \nvery presence. \n29 September 1931, \nLondon, to Mr. Vivian, \nLM4 p1439 \nQ. How can spirituality be attained? \nBaba: It can be attained, not by the intellect, but by heart and feeling and inner experience. I \ncould explain for hours, but that would be nothing compared to one second of my internal \nhelp. Do one thing. Every night, just before retiring, think for one minute, \"The infinite God \nis within me, and I am part of the infinite.\" This will connect you more and more with me \ninternally. \n1930s, A p6 \nMeditation: do it very, very seriously. By that I mean follow literally every external \ninstruction. To each I have given different external instructions. How to sit, how to close the \neyes, how to open, etc. As for the internal, try best how to think: what to think, I have told \neach separately. Be very serious. If thoughts disturb you, don't worry. If difficulties arise, tell \nme and I will make changes. \nThis is not mere meditation. I am slowly leading you towards making the mind a blank, and \nthe trick is distraction and concentration. When, for instance, I tell you to open your eyes for \nfive minutes, close them for five minutes, and during the opening five minutes repeat 'Baba, \nBaba,' and during the closing five minutes 'I am.' It takes at least five minutes now to have \nyour mind concentrated. The moment the mind concentrates, you have to open your eyes \nagain and are distracted. If this goes on, then the mind becomes a blank. It is like cutting \n(sawing). When you saw with a file, you don't simply cut straight, you saw back and forth. \nTo some I don't give this distraction, because for them it is better to be merged in the object. \nSo each should do as I instruct. Remember, this is very important. During the five, ten or \nfifteen minutes, or the one hour that you do it, do your best to concentrate. Because after \nfive minutes there is going to be distraction does not mean that you do not have to \nconcentrate for the five minutes. Concentrate; if not, where is the distraction? If you don't \nsaw forwards, you can't saw backwards. \nIf in the first one whole hour you concentrate for one minute, it is more than enough. But \nthat one minute you have to be conscious and unconscious. Half a minute is worthwhile, so \ntry to do it very, very seriously, as if your very spiritual life depended on it, not merely as \nexercise, drill or a bore, or like taking castor oil. Clear? \nOnce you experience a tiny bit of what I intend giving, it will be bliss just to sit and \nconcentrate on me. Till then try to follow literally. Whenever any difficulty arises tell me. If \nthere is any noise, have it stopped. Today I found some men working - noise. \nExternal silence helps in inner silence, and only in internal silence is Baba found - profound \ninternal silence. \n2 April 1937, Nasik, \nAw 16:2 p45-46 \nFor more about this kind of meditation \nsee Di (7th ed.) p238-239 \nKitty Davy wrote: \"Sometimes Baba sat with us on the lawn and gave us thirty minutes in \nsilence. This we loved.\" \nBaba: Tomorrow we will have silence in the evening, but one condition is very important: \nthat you do not look around at one another, but only look at me, and feel as if you are alone \nwith me. You should do it naturally and without strain. You must not feel conscious of your \nbodies. Let the head be the center of your body. When it is, then you forget your body and \nyou can think of me. \nWill Backett: What should I do if I feel pressure in the head? \nBaba: Relax, as if going to sleep. Close your eyes. If you can look at me in such a \nconcentrated manner that you forget your body, it is best. If you do not close your eyes, look \nat me, but be so immersed in me that you forget your body. I leave it to you. What I mean is \nthat I work internally for the world, and if you, while meditating, forget your body and \nconcentrate on me, you share in the work. \n13 April 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p166 and LM6 p2155 \nFrom today I want everyone to sit silent and alone for five minutes, and try to look within. It \nis not a meditation, it is just a looking within. \nNow, how to do this? Sit in a relaxed position. Don't think of anything, not even of Baba. \nClose the eyes and mentally look within, and imagine yourself as infinite within. Let the idea \nthat you are infinite remain for five minutes. \nHow do you imagine yourself infinite? You can imagine the infinite as sky, ocean or vast \nemptiness. And let this one thought be in your mind, that you are infinite within. Is it clear? \n... It is very, very important for me to help you and give you what I want to give. \n13 April 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p166 and LM6 p2154 \nMeditation - some love it, some don't like it. I hate it. But I like being meditated upon, \nbecause then I help directly. Love is meditation in its highest form, but only that love which \ndoes not forget the beloved for a single moment. Then meditation is not necessary, it is \nsuperfluous. \n1937, LA p178 \nMeditation may be described as the path which the individual cuts for himself while trying \nto get beyond the limitations of the mind. \nc.1940, Di v3 p35 \nMeditation should not be resorted to with a heavy heart as if it were like taking castor oil. \nOne has got to be serious about meditation, But this does not mean that the aspirant must \nalways look grave or melancholy. Sense of humor and cheerfulness not only do not interfere \nwith the progress of meditation, but actually contribute to it. Meditation should not be \nartificially turned into a distasteful and tiresome thing. The aspirant should freely allow \nhimself the natural joy which is attendant upon successful meditation, without getting \naddicted to it. \nMeditation should be something like a picnic on the higher planes. Like excursions into new \nand beautiful natural surroundings, meditation brings with it a sense of enthusiasm, \nadventure, peace and exhilaration. All thoughts of depression, fear or worry have to be \ncompletely cut out if there is to be a really successful meditation... \nIt is no use wasting psychic energy by directly trying to combat and repress the disturbing \nthoughts. Any such attempts involve giving further attention to the disturbing thoughts; and \nthe disturbing thoughts feed upon the very attention which is given to them for the purpose \nof repressing them, and get thereby further strengthened and confirmed in consciousness. \nThe best thing is to ignore them, and to turn to the object of meditation as early as possible, \nwithout attaching any undue importance to the disturbing factors. By recognising the \nirrelevance and worthlessness of the disturbing thoughts, and the relative value and \nimportance of the object of meditation, it becomes possible to leave the disturbing thoughts \nto themselves to die their natural death through sheer neglect, and to make the mind \npermanently steady in the object of meditation. \nc.1940, \nIndia, \nDi v3 p41, 43 \nThe different types of genuine meditation all dwell upon aspects of life which are equally \ntrue. But relative to the psychic state of the individual, the assimilation of a certain truth of \nlife is often more urgently necessary than the assimilation of some other truths of life. \nTherefore the Masters never prescribe the same form of meditation to all, but they give \nspecific instructions according to the individual needs of the aspirant. \nThe type of meditation which is necessary in a particular situation can often not be correctly \nascertained by the aspirant for himself. The aspirant can get addicted to one type of \nmeditation so exclusively that he finds it difficult to get out of the groove which has been cut \ninto his mind by the type of meditation which he has been practising. He fails to see the \nimportance of any other type of meditation, and is not drawn by it. \nThe aspirant may, of course, himself come to feel his own deficiency along a particular line. \nBut just as many medicines are disagreeable to the patient, the types of meditation which \nare really indicated in a specific situation often come to the aspirant as being distasteful, \nand he is disinclined to take to them. The help and insight of a Master are indispensable on \nthis point. The insight which a Master has into the deeper and real spiritual needs of the \naspirant is infinitely greater than the insight which the aspirant can hope to have in himself. \nAnd the specific instructions from the Master supply the necessary corrective for the \nneglected aspects of personality. \n... If the aspirant takes to any type of meditation on his own initiative, and without having \nthe benefit of the guidance and supervision of the Master, he may get into it so far that he \nloses his perspective, and is unable to recover himself. It may be impossible for him to \nchange over to some other complementary mode of meditation, even when it is absolutely \nnecessary. This risk is avoided if the aspirant has taken to a line of meditation on the orders \nof his Master. When he is under the guidance and supervision of the Master, the Master \ncannot only ask the aspirant to halt at the right time, but he can actually help him to get out \nof the grooves cut by his previous meditation. ...It is safer for the aspirant to rely upon the \nMaster than upon any provisions of his own making. \nc.1940, \nIndia, \nDi v3 p49-51 \nPersonal meditation is directed towards persons who are spiritually Perfect. Just as a man \nwho admires the character of Napoleon and constantly thinks about him has a tendency to \nbecome like him, an aspirant who admires some spiritually Perfect person and constantly \nthinks about him has a tendency to become spiritually Perfect. A suitable object of personal \nmeditation is to be found in a living Master or Avatar, or in the Masters and Avatars of the \npast. But it is important to have as an object of personal meditation a person who is \nspiritually Perfect. If the person who is selected for meditation happens to be spiritually \nimperfect, there is every chance of his frailties percolating into the mind of the aspirant who \nmeditates upon him. But if the person who is selected for meditation is spiritually Perfect, \nthe aspirant has taken to a safe and sure path. \nc.1940, \nDi v3 p72-73 \n(Baba gave his women disciples a meditation in which they sang seven names of God: Hari, \nParamatma, Allah, Ahuramazd, God, Yezdan, Hu. \nLove comes in the last stage of meditation. It is the longing for the beloved that brings one \nnearer to that stage. \nIn the morning you say the seven names of God. When I say 'do it from the heart,' it means, \nfirst, you must feel that you are taking the name of God. Secondly, you must have the fixed \nidea in your mind that all these names are one. The vibration of your repetition helps. These \nnames I have so selected and arranged that they vibrate and help if done with feeling. I \nintend for the masts to sing this. They will help more because their minds work either too \nfast or too slow, so that it seems at a stop. \nI had a follower named Barsoap. While meditating he would go to sleep, but in the posture \nof meditation. When anyone shook him awake, he would claim he was in deep meditation. \nBut one day I caught him, and he admitted he was sleeping. So, like Barsoap, do not go to \nsleep during meditation, but sing the names sincerely. \n22 August 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2602 \nThose who can meditate should do so. Those who cannot should repeat my name for half an \nhour. You must meditate daily, but the day I come to visit you it doesn't matter. For some, \nmeditation is suitable. For others it is not. And a very few enjoy it. \nThe meaning of meditation is to go within yourselves, right inside of you. Those who love \nGod, that love takes them within. In some ashrams like Madurai and Pondicherry, there are \nactual meditation classes. But meditation has never yet made a person one with God. \nHafez said to the Sufis, 'If you have the whim to achieve union with God, become as the dust \nat the feet of one who has become united with him.' \nMeditation gives peace and some inner revelation to some fortunate ones. Aurobindo has \nwritten in his book, 'I am trying to attain to that state through meditation.' If illumination is \nattained through meditation, it is no small thing. \nThe meaning of meditation is to go deep within one's own self. It is self-hypnotism in the \ndivine way, to lose yourself. Meditation is meant to forget the self, by not thinking of \nanything but the Self. \nAurobindo is on the sixth plane, not by the state of a wali-mast, but by meditation. Chatti \nBaba never meditated, yet he sees God all day and night. And though both are on the sixth \nplane, there is a great difference between them. Love gives permanence. Meditation gives \nsamadhi. After union with God, complete permanency exists, whether you come down to \nGross consciousness or not. If you come down, you bring God with you. \nAurobindo writes beautifully about the deep valley between seeing God and God himself. He \nsays, 'We cry out on this side, O God, we see you, but we cannot come to you. So at least you \ncome to us.' And God replies, 'I always do come, as Ram, Krishna, Buddha and others.' \nSufis do not give a damn for meditation. They love. Meditation is good. If you love and \nmeditate, there is no harm. If you love and do not meditate, there is no harm. But don't \nmeditate as if you have taken quinine powder. Meaning that it is something to somehow or \nother be done with and gotten over. \nIf you are interested in meditation, you ought to do it with joy. If you do not like meditation, \nthen you have to take my name. And if you love me, taking my name ought to give you joy. \nDo it when and where you like. \nEven in the Himalayas, you cannot have complete stillness. But after September, you can \nmeditate near the dome (Baba's tomb). Samadhi is the state where you do not hear a gun \nfired, even at close range. The drawback in meditation is that any noise disturbs it. But love \nhas no such obstruction. There, the lover is merged in the thought of his beloved. He does \nnot meditate, he only loves. Neither noise nor any obstacle bothers him. \nto his women disciples, \n8 September 1940 \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2608-2609 \nBaba: Who was it who said, \"Unless you lose yourself, you cannot find yourself?' \nElizabeth Patterson: Christ. \nBaba: What does it mean? \nWoman disciple: To conquer desire. \nAnother woman disciple: To annihilate the lower self. \nElizabeth: To quote the words of the saint, 'Not my will be done, but thine.' \nBaba nodded, and 'said' that Elizabeth's answer was the nearest to the full truth. He \ncontinued: \n\"It means three things in one. First, love God so much that you forget yourself. Second, \nsacrifice your carnal desires for the soul. And third, complete resignation to God's will. And \nwhen you love too much, you do forget yourself. \nNow, how to do that practically? Love for other things like men, women, cars, dogs, etc., \ncomes spontaneously. It is no gift, but spontaneity, it is natural. Loving God comes by \npractise and by process to a certain point. But loving God mostly is a gift...\" \nTo love Baba, you need to think of Baba. If you think of Baba, you do not think of yourself. \nThe more you think of Baba, the less you think of yourself. So to love God so much that you \nforget yourself means that you think of God so much that you can no longer think of \nyourself. By thinking continually, you become what you think of deeply. The mind makes \none become what one thinks of deeply. \nIf you think of Baba all the time, you cannot think of yourself. If you don't think of me, you \nwill remain unmoved. Only when Rano thinks of Nonny* does she feel badly. When she \ndoesn't think of her mother, there is no feeling. \nYet another meditation school has opened in Poona, called the Mother's Lodge. These \nmeditation classes do not impart love. Meditation creates peace, not love. Thinking brings \nabout love when done continually and deeply. In meditation, you try to stop thinking. The \nstoppage gives peace. But to love, you must think of the beloved. If your mind becomes still, \nyour beloved does not exist any more. Then how can there be love when there is no \nbeloved? \nThis is a very important point, this differentiation. When you meditate, you try to forget \neverything, even yourself. In loving, you forget every thing and self, but you remember the \nbeloved. In real and perfect meditation, which is rare, you forget your body, yourself and \neverything else. In loving you also forget self, body and everything, but you remember the \nbeloved. In meditation, the beloved does not exist. That is why it is said that in meditation, \nthe most you can get is samadhi - forgetting everything and deriving peace. But never God-\nrealisation. It is only attained by love. \nHave any of you read about the saint Aurobindo? \nto his women disciples, \n22 September 1940 \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2613-2614 \n*Rano's mother Nonny had died recently. \nThose of you who are unable to meditate should repeat my name without being bothered by \nthoughts. Thoughts are like mosquitoes, and my name is the mosquito net. When you are \nwithin the mosquito net, the mosquitoes may buzz around you, but they cannot bite you. \nThus, by repeating my name, like the mosquito net, it will save you from the stings of the \nmosquito-thoughts that try to distract you, and you will be unmoved. \nto his women disciples, \n12 December 1940 \nnear Calicut, \nLM7 p2649 \nDon't meditate mechanically. Meditate in the form of a prayer, and get so much drowned in \nit that you lose yourselves. An Arab always wore a golden ring on his finger. He was a great \nlover of God, and when he prayed, he forgot everything. Once when he was praying, a thief \ncut off his finger and stole the ring. But the Arab was so engrossed in prayer he did not feel \nthe slightest pain. This is called prayer. This is real prayer. \n1941? India? LM8 p2733 \nSome Masters put forth the way of defeating the mind through mind itself, through \nmeditation and concentration. When mind is concentrated, its further function is weakened, \nand the sanskaras exhaust themselves. Thus the sanskaras, which are like worms, and \nwhich must have food, eat themselves. But during this process the mind feels frustrated and \ngets more desperate. Unwanted thoughts that you never had assail you, and eventually one \nof three things happen: \n1. You get fed up and you can no longer concentrate, \n2. You get sleepy or drowsy, \n3. You continue to get more and more bad thoughts. \nFor the very few who persist patiently with a brave heart, the result is that the mind is \ntemporarily stopped. Then one experiences ecstasy (bhav). But it becomes like dope, to \nwhich one gets addicted, or one goes into samadhi (trance). But this is not manonash \n(annihilation of the mind). Thus, through concentration, annihilation of the mind is not \npossible. \n29 June 1951, \nHyderabad, \nGG2 p345-346 \nAnother version: LM10 p3716 \nHow will you meditate? To meditate you must think about God. But God is infinite and \neternal, so how will you be able to imagine this? You can't, it is beyond the mind. \nSo think of God as all-pervading effulgence. Try to bring before your mind's eye a picture of \nan ocean of infinite, all-pervading effulgence, which is God. A shoreless, bottomless ocean. \nBut if this ocean of effulgence is infinite and all-pervading, where will you be? What will \nyour position be? If you imagine this ocean in front of you, then it is not infinite. So try to \nbring before your mind's eye this infinite ocean of effulgence, and imagine yourself in it. You \nare in the midst of this infinite ocean of effulgence. Try to picture this when you meditate. \nSatara, DH p62-63 \nNarayan Rao asked Baba how one could retain contact with him constantly. Baba answered: \nHe means, now that Baba is physically among us we feel the contact, but when Baba \nphysically leaves us, gradually this contact cools down. How to retain it constantly? \nDo you feel constantly hungry? When you feel hungry, you take food, and then you forget \nabout the food. When you work hard, you get hungry. And so work for me in such a way that \nyou feel hungry for me, sometimes thinking of me, sometimes working for me, sometimes \ntalking about me, but not continually. If you go on eating continually, you will get \nindigestion. \nWhen you go to sleep, say \"Baba, I entrust all that I did, thought or spoke, good and bad, to \nyou.\" When you get up, say \"Baba, I now begin entrusting all to you.\" \nThis much will be more than sufficient for me. Say only twice a day for five minutes, do that, \nand make me responsible for all you do or think, but wholeheartedly. Then you are free. \nNothing can bind you. But you must do it honestly. I am the ocean. I can accept both, \nflowers, coconut, and also filth. So throw everything in the ocean with all your heart. This is \na great thing to be done wholeheartedly. Otherwise it goes in a pool of water, which gets \nfilthy because of your own dirt. \n4 March 1954, \nKakinada, Andhra, \nAD p158-139 \nAs I said the other day, we breathe all the time _ sahaj manner, that is, unconscious of it. The \nsame with clothes. While you have been listening to me, you did not think of clothes. That is \nthe meaning of sahaj. If you want to think of me continually, to remember me, the easiest \nand shortest way is to do as I tell you now. This will be something of a task. At first you will \nhave to do it with an effort, but later you will do it in the most natural way. \nThere are said to be four main periods in the day, just as there are four main periods in \nman's physical status: childhood, young man, middle age, and old age. So four periods in the \nday, which Kabir called signposts. First thing in the morning, as soon as you get up, before \ndoing anything, for one second think of Baba, and then begin the day. Then Baba has \ncovered your soul, just as dress covers your body. So put on your soul's clothes in the \nmorning. Do it honestly, and you will feel he is with you. Secondly, at exactly 12:00 noon, for \none second, think of Baba. Thirdly, at about 5 o'clock, for one second, think of Baba. Then \nyou can do anything else you like - do anything, but at five o'clock think of Baba for one \nsecond. Fourthly, just before you lie down on your bed, give thought for Baba. Then you will \nfeel Baba's companionship. \nBe practical in the world, and yet have Baba with you all the time. So for four seconds think \nof Baba. One who does this honestly will be keeping Baba constantly with him. This is the \nbeginning of sahaj dhyan. When you do this, at first you will have to be on guard, but then it \nwill become automatic. \nSeptember 1954, \nMeherabad, \nTK p 349-350 \nIf those who love me will just for one minute, as now, be silent in their minds just before \nthey go to bed, and think of me and picture me in the silence of their minds, and do this \nregularly, then this veil of ignorance that we have will disappear, and this bliss that I speak \nof, and which all long for, we shall experience. \nBecause of my love for you, picture me now, as you look at me now, and picture me every \nday for that one minute in silence. Do it every day. Don't break the sequence of this daily \nconnection, and then you will achieve this bliss. \nJuly 1956, \nLondon, \nAw 4:2 p 13 \nFrom now on, every week, on Wednesdays at 12 o'clock midnight... those who want to... \nwith eyes open and lights put out, in complete darkness, relaxing... completely before \nmeditating, for fifteen minutes, with eyes wide open, breathing, with every breath repeat \nBa-ba, Ba-ba. Every time you breathe in and breathe out, not audibly, but just within \nyourself, repeat with every breath you breathe, inhaling and exhaling... Ba-ba, Ba-ba. \nThen if you have certain experiences like seeing lights or colors or circles of lights, bright \ncircles, do not give any significance or importance to that. Continue your repetitions every \nweek. Sometimes you might see a big halo and Baba there in that.* Fix your attention on \nthat figure but continue to repeat. Do so with all sincerity and devotion, and then you will \nsee me in all, and then you will have the experience of seeing me in everyone... the \nimportant thing is that one should see me in everyone. \nAnd if you can do this... sit at midnight on every Wednesday, every week, for 15 minutes in \ncomplete darkness, beginning your meditation from 12 o'clock midnight, with open eyes \nand repeating 'Baba' with every breath - inhale and exhale - and not paying any attention to \nany experiences you get while meditating, but when you see Baba, focus your attention on \nthat, and continue your repetitions, and then you'll see Baba in everyone... \nQ. How will we know it's fifteen minutes? \nBaba: An alarm watch, a timepiece. Don't meditate on the time itself. Have an alarm watch, \nset it, and as soon as the alarm rings just stop the meditation. \nI am in everyone and everything. I am not only this as you see me, in flesh and blood. I am \nthe ocean. Those who dare to drown themselves in this ocean, they can get the pearl out of \nthe ocean... \n1 August 1956, \nLos Angeles, \nto Dante Leo Cardella's \nmeditation group, \ntranscribed from a tape \n*\"When one turns his back to the world and his face to God, he may hear sweet melodies, \nsmell fragrances or see light-globes. In the light-globe he generally sees the figure of his \nMaster, revealing him in his resplendent divine glory and perfection. The exquisite \nbrilliance and splendor of such light-globes is so enchanting and bewildering that the \naspirant seeks nothing else, and is completely absorbed in gazing fixedly at them. This noor \nor light-globe is a real object. It is no dream or hallucination. But it is only the first stage of a \nlong path. It should not be mistaken for the goal, which is to become the shoreless and \nformless ocean of Truth.\" \nbefore 1948, ST p49-50 \nBaba: Where is God? \nVisitor: God is in everyone and everything, in every particle of dust. \nBaba: Is this not mere book knowledge? Is this your experience? Even a child can make such \nstatements. So unless you have the experience, it is useless to make such statements. If you \nare really keen about the Truth, try to meditate with love on the divine form of your choice, \nor remember the name of God wholeheartedly. Then, with divine grace, a fortunate one sees \nGod face to face, everywhere and in everything, far more clearly and intimately than you see \nthe things in this room now with your physical eyes. \nBefore the real seeing is revealed, one gets many experiences on the Path. If not rightly \nvalued, these experiences prove very alluring and deceptive... \nOne has to be very watchful about the tricky nature of the ego, which tries to maintain its \nseparateness more and more. One thing is certain: the more importance and attention you \npay to such experiences, the more you get bound. Don't run after the experiences, but \nremain steadfast in your love for God. \nGuruprasad, \nPoona, 1960, \nDH p1-4 \nThere are various retreats in India where meditation classes are held, and different but set \ntechniques of meditation are observed, which, if followed faithfully and for a long time, \nresult in slight occult experiences, such as seeing flashes of light, colors, even visions, etc. \nThese occult experiences, by themselves, are nothing, are in the domain of illusion, and not \nonly have no direct bearing on the incomparable reality of God-realisation, but can actually \nbecome a hindrance and obstruction to the aspirant's path to God. \nThe direct path to God is the path of love. Love is not derived from meditation. It has \nnothing to do with it. Love is a grace of God. One in many has it, and it is all-sufficient. Love \ndoes not depend on anything but itself. Love without meditation is enough. Meditation \nwithout love is not. That is why Sadgurus or Perfect Masters do not set meditation for their \ndisciples as a necessary routine. Rather, they stress the aspect of love and selfless service. \nThe masters of the path, on the other hand, not having reached the goal themselves, \nadvocate meditation to the aspirants following them. \n1960s? India, \nGG2 p345, \nAw 3:4 p31 \nLove and direct relatedness with the Avatar is the high road of all roads of inner \ndevelopment. And while I am in the body, and for some time after I drop my body, the \npotential for love and direct relation is there and should be used. \nBut one day, as the truth and presence of the Avatar begins to diminish, humanity will have \nto use lesser, secondary techniques, and I must provide for that time. And so I have given \nout these extensive discourses on meditation. But do not mistake me, because meanwhile it \nis a distraction of your time and energy to use meditation. \n1960s? \nto Don Stevens, \nGl February 1994, \np 19 referring to the chapters on meditation in 'Discourses' \nMeditation Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved. Email mehersthan at gmail.com \nMiracles 1 \nMiracles 1 \nMEDITATION \nMEDITATION \nSome people believe that Meher Baba discouraged meditation. This misunderstanding \nseems to have come about because some of Baba's Mandali had never practised meditation. \n\"What are the members of my Mandali doing? They are neither doing japa (repeating God's \nname) nor tapa (penance), nor practising any type of yoga. They have dedicated their lives \nto me, and have been holding firmly to me for a long time. Even yogis cannot do a part of \nthis.\" \nMeher Baba, 24 May 1945 \nMeherabad, LM8 p3031-3036 \nSome of the members of Baba's Circle did not need to do spiritual practices. But it is just the \nopposite for other aspirants. \n\"There is a difference in the Avatar's or Sadguru's attitude toward their Circles, and toward \nthe general public. The members of the Circle are like the sons of the Master, and the \ngeneral public are like non-family members. \n\"For example, if a newsboy turns into a millionaire, he would teach others the ways by \nwhich he became so, and tell them that if they followed him, they too would become \nmillionaires. But to his sons he will give the riches, not descriptions of how he acquired the \nriches. \n\"In the same way, the Avatar and Sadgurus never explain to members of their Circles the \nways and means of the Path. They just place them right on the Path to God-realisation itself; \nwhile to ordinary people they explain the ways and means to achieve it. The Circle members \ndo not need these explanations, because they are the inheritors of the divine wealth, the \nheirs. When the wealth itself is in hand, what is the necessity for explaining the ways to \nobtain it? \n\"There are special rules for my Circle members. I put up with and forgive their serious \nfaults...\" \n13 February 1940, Bangalore, LM7 p2519 \nSo a Mandali member may not be the best person to explain 'the ways and means of the \nPath.' And spiritual practices such as meditation may be unnecessary for the Mandali but \nnecessary for ordinary aspirants. \nThis is an explanation of the difference between these two different ways of following a \nPerfect Master or the Avatar, written by Abdul Ghani from notes dictated to him by Meher \nBaba: \nElect and Select Disciples \n\"The Perfect one of the seventh plane of God-realisation - the Qutub - has a different \ntechnique altogether in the matter of dealing with aspirants. Every Qutub has two types of \ndisciples - the Elect and the Select. \n\"The Elect ones are those who have a sort of spiritual relationship with the Master (Qutub), \nborn of services rendered or part played toward him, even antagonistically, in past \nincarnations. Such aspirants are invariably the claimants to the spiritual heritage of the \nMaster. And even if they appear of indifferent caliber in the present life, the Master trains \nand prepares them in his company to become fit and deserving recipients of his divine \ngrace. 'When the disciple is ready, the Master comes,' is said of aspirants belonging to this \ncategory. Their number is always twelve. The twelve apostles of Christ and the twelve \nimams of Hazrat Ali are suggestive of this situation. \n\"Select disciples of a Master have an unlimited scope, qualitatively and quantitatively. These \nare the fortunate ones who earn the grace of the Perfect One (Qutub) by sheer dint of merit \nand services rendered. The spiritual benefit accruing to this category is in proportion to the \nquality of their self-surrender to the will of the Master. It is such aspirants who are in need \nof disciplinary exercises and meditation papers. Visualising these two types - the Elect and \nSelect ones - I gave you the impression in my previous letters that exercises and papers are \nboth necessary and unnecessary. The Elect ones are the inheritors, and the Select ones are \nthe winners of the Master's grace. \n\"Thus, in the domain of Perfection of the seventh plane of God-realisation (the Qutub), the \nquestion of initiation and discipleship doesn't arise. Every atom of the universe is \nequidistant from the center, the Qutub, round which everything and everyone revolves. In \nfact, according to Baba, one is entitled to call himself or herself a disciple only after getting \nIllumination from the Master. Till such time, all - high or low, near or distant - are mere \naspirants, and nothing more.\" \nAbdul Ghani, 10 September 1948, from \na letter to Ivy Duce, HM p718-719 \n'Elect' disciples are the members of the Master's Circle. 'Select' disciples are those who are \nnot of the Circle. Meditation and other practices may not be necessary for the Elect disciples, \nbut the Select ones may need to meditate or make other spiritual efforts. \nFor more on meditation, see the chapter MEDITATION in Book One and Book Two. \nBack to top \nWHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE? \nDid God create the universe?  Did Meher Baba? \n\"People say that God created maya, but it is not so. For example, take the hair on the head. \nThe hair is maya, and the head is God the creator. Although the hair grows on the head, the \nhead does not know how, why and where it comes from. Then how can it be said that the \nhead created hair, or God created maya? But in a way, the very creation of maya itself is \ndependent on God. Maya is sheer illusion, the force of imagination.\" \nMeher Baba, 30 June 1926 \nMeherabad, LM3 p820 \nQ. Why did God create all this? \nBaba: He did not create it. It started automatically. First there was God and nothing else. In \nGod was everything: experience, knowledge, power and existence. But he had no \nconsciousness that he was God. All this bother and headache you see around you is to gain \nthat consciousness. \nMeher Baba, 7 October 1926, \nMeherabad, LM3 p855 \n\"How was the universe created? It was automatic. There are innumerable universes, which \nare interlaced with one another. One universe creates another in a chain reaction. These \nuniverses are so numerous that even Sadgurus cannot count them... \n\"Now I will explain to you about Ishwar. Ishwar is the creator, preserver and dissolver as \none: Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. This Ishwar is God, but does not know himself. He is in \nthe state of infinite unconsciousness. However, he knows how to create, preserve and \ndestroy the creation. How is this? When you blow up a balloon, your eyes are on the \ninflating of the balloon, and so you look at that and not at yourself. In the same way, the eyes \nof Ishwar are fixed on his creation, and not on himself.\" \nMeher Baba, 2 December 1927 \nMeherabad. LM3 p988-989 \nQ. How did the universe come about? \nBaba: \"Universe, if understood as created, has an entirely different meaning from our \nviewpoint that the universe does not exist. \n\"Actually, it is only God who appears as the universe. But it is necessary to creation to have \nthis dual idea of God and universe. \n\"To know the exact meaning of the awake state, one has to experience the dream state. \nDreams can be good and bad. In a dream you can suffer or enjoy. But when you wake up, \nyou find it was all a dream. But this dream should be so adjusted that it awakens you soon. \nSacrifice, character and selfless service help in waking you soon.\" \nEurope? 1930s? A p47 \n\"The whole world is created and carried on by the force of the imagination.\" \nMeher Baba, 1930s? \nAw 10:4 p 1, also PL p32 \n\"The existence of this whole phenomenal world is all due to your mind. It all exists because \nyour mind works. Once the mind stops, the world of phenomena ceases to be.\" \nMeher Baba, 15 May 1943 \nMeherabad, LM8 p2876 \nQ. Why has God created this universe? \nBaba: \"Who says God has created this world? We have created it by our own imagination. \n\"God is supreme, independent. When we say he has created this illusion, we lower him and \nhis infinity. He is beyond all this. \n\"Only when we find him in ourselves, and even in our day to day life, do all doubts vanish. \nWe then know him, and therefore have not even to think about him. \n\"Do you ever have to think as to whether you are a man or a woman? The answer is no, \nbecause you know you are a man. So it is when we become God. Unless and until we \nexperience this supreme knowledge, it is all mere talk, reasoning, logic and theory.\" \nMeher Baba, 23 March 1953, Dehra Dun \nBG p6. Also Gl Feb. 1966 and Aw 1:2 p11 \n\"Since, in the very beginning, imagination gave a twist to substance, and importance to \nshadow, we, who are eternally free, find ourselves bound, having lost our original self in the \nmaze of illusion. Therefore, despite possessing infinite bliss, we have to experience misery, \nworries, doubts, failure and helplessness. \n\"When in a flash real knowledge comes, we are not what we seem, but are that infinite one. \nAll worries disappear, because in reality sukh (pleasure) and dukh (misery) do not exist. To \nget rid of this persistent ignorance and to know the true value of reality, we have to \nexperience God; and God, who is the breath and life of our lives, can only be experienced \nthrough honest love.\" \nMeher Baba, 23 March 1953 \nDehra Dun, BG p6-7 \nAbout the relationship of the Perfect Master to Ishwar, the Creator - Preserver - Destroyer \naspect of God, Baba explained, \n\"The Sadguru can interfere in the Creator's working, but he rarely does so. For the most part \nhe leaves the Creator and the creation to manage their own affairs.\" \nMeher Baba, July? 1927 \nMeherabad, SW p401 \nFor more on this subject, see the chapter CREATION in Book One and Book Two. \nBack to top \nMEDITATION \nBook Two \n\"At about seven in the morning, the Master came to the building in which the disciples are \nstaying at present. He seated himself on his charpoy and allowed the disciples to take \ndarshana of him. \n\"A cup of tea was brought to him. He began sipping it, but as soon as he caught sight of a \nParsi disciple entering the room, he put down the cup, and to the surprise of all present, \nasked him when he had got up. \n'Quarter to seven, sir,' was the reply. \n\"The Master gently rebuked him for getting up so late, and then remarked to all present, \n'Spiritual aspirants should get up very early. If you get up so late, there is not much \ndifference between you and the worldly-minded people. \n'The early hours of the morning, from three to six, are best for meditation. Five or six hours \nsleep is quite sufficient for you. \n'Those whom I have asked to meditate regularly must go to bed at nine p.m. and get up at 3 \na.m.' \nKaikhushru Dastur \n14 February 1929, Meherabad \nMeher Message 1:3  p25-26 (March 1929) \nBaba said about the exercise of 'looking within': \n\"From now on, one hour's meditation as usual every day, according to individual \ninstructions. And when I am here, half an hour's silence with me in the evening. Also from \ntoday, this extra five minutes. It is very, very important for me to help you, and give you \nwhat I want to give.' \nKitty Davy wrote, \"During the meditation hour Baba wanted complete quiet in the \ncompound.\" \nLA p166, LM6 p2155 (1937?) \n\"Baba had given us meditation for a specified period each day. No one was exempt. Each one \nhad to see to her chores, including the pets, and be ready when the bell for meditation was \nrung. We would rush to our places with Baba's photo in front of us. He was to be our \nmeditation.\" \nMehera Irani, Baba Loved Us Too p72 \n\"Remember me before starting and after finishing any work. Think of me before doing \nanything. If you have to write something, remember me before starting, and then mentally \nsay 'Baba, it is you, not I, who is writing.'\" \nMeher Baba, 30 March 1930, Nasik, LM4 p1293 \nMeher Baba corresponded with some of his Western followers, and answered their \nquestions about meditation. In March, 1936, Baba had a chart prepared for meditation. He \nexplained, \n\"They must think, 'I am not this body.' The chart will help them to meditate, and they will \nescape from the rush of thoughts that crowd their minds during meditation.\" \n10 March 1936, Mysore, LM6 p1989 \n(This may have been the chart that was eventually printed at the end of  'The Perfect \nMaster' by Charles Purdom, which was published in 1937. The chart and reading meditation \nbegin on page 317 of that book. The book includes another meditation for reading, \nbeginning on page 305.) \n\"Baba would ask each individual about their morning meditation and encourage them to \ntake it seriously. On Sunday, January 17 he remarked, \n\"'I want you to be lighthearted and enjoy humor, but I also want you to be serious about \ncertain points, especially about meditation. Constant prayer and selfless service are both \nvital in turning the mind away from worldly things and directing it toward spirituality.' \n\"Each person would meditate alone in his or her room upon rising in the morning. Once \nBaba suprised Rano by coming into the room as she was meditating. He caught her dozing \nback to sleep, and instructed her to keep a photograph of him in front of her and \nconcentrate on it. \n\"During the meditation hour, Baba directed that there must be absolute quiet in the \ncompound. \n\"'External silence helps in inner silence, and only in internal silence is Baba found, in \nprofound inner silence.' \n\"Baba gave each individual instructions in regard to meditation. He directed Malcolm \nSchloss not to tell anyone but him what he saw or heard during meditation. Malcolm asked \nif he should interrupt his meditation to write down anything which came to him while \nmeditating. \n\"'No,' Baba replied, 'What you see, once you begin seeing this way, you will never forget. You \nwill know what you are and where you are going. You will be like a rock - you will know \nwhere you stand.'\" \n1937, Nasik, Bhau Kalchuri, LM6 p2084-2085 \nGarrett Fort: What happens when you establish a direct mental contact with you, Baba, \nthinking of you? \nBaba: Now, this is very important. The difference is so subtle between imagination and \ncontact, yet there is a world of difference. When you imagine, you have no purpose. When \nyou contact, you have a purpose. \nMalcom Schloss: It's clear. But even in contact, don't you use the imagination? \nBaba: Yes, imagination is in the background. \n14 March 1937, Nasik, LM7 p2138 \nBaba ordered a group of men to observe a particular fast from January 1st to February 15th \n1942, and \n\"1. To read UNDERSTANDINGLY Meher Baba's pamphlet on Meditation once a day. Those \nwho cannot read should have it read by somebody. In this case, the reader need not read it \nseparately for himself. \n\"2. To repeat in a low voice for half an hour daily one of the following six lines of names of \nGod: \nParabrahma Paramatma \nYa Yezdan Ahuramazd \nNirkar Parvardigar \nAllah ho Akbar Allah Hu \nHari Narayan Bhagwan \nGod Almighty Omnipotent \n\"3. Immediately after this half an hour of meditation, repeat the name of your Master for \nfive minutes. \n\"4. No fixed time for observing orders number one and two is enforced. They may be \nobserved simultatneously or separately, according to one's convenience of time.\" \nMeher Baba, 23 October 1941 \nPanchgani, LM8 p2732 \nIn June 1942 Baba and his group stayed in Rishikesh. The women were in a house on a cliff \noverlooking the Ganges. \n\"While there, Baba told us to meditate every evening for half an hour. After washing our \nclothes, we sat on the river bank and thought of Baba. He had told us, \n'Take my name and think of me. Don't worry if thoughts come, just repeat my name. It's like \na mosquito net; the thoughts that come won't sting you.'\" \nMehera Irani, M p147 \nIn 1943 Meher Baba invited 125 men from all over  India to visit him at Meherabad. They \narrived May 14th, and stayed till May 19th. Baba gave them a reading meditation entitled \n'The Divine Theme,' which included charts to help explain the material. He told them how to \ndeal with disturbing thoughts during the meditation. Some of Baba's explanations to the \ngroup are in LM8 p2870-2887. \n'The Divine Theme for Meditation' is printed in The Perfect Master, p305-316. Another \nversion is in Discourses (7th edition) p219-227. A third version is in God Speaks (2nd \nedition) p232-243. Each version includes instructions for the meditation. \nBaba summed up his explanations on the Divine Theme to Chagan, who had missed them \nbecause he had to cook: \n'Now listen to this. In brief: you always live in water, but you have no idea what water is. \n'Understood?' \n(LM8 p2889) \nNana Kher first met Meher Baba in Ahmednagar in May 1945. \nBaba: What do you want? \nNana Kher: Spiritual freedom. \nBaba: Would you follow my orders? \nNana: I am fully prepared to do as you say. \nBaba: Fast every Sunday, and feed a beggar on that day. Meditate for fifteen minutes daily, \nand lead a simple, pure life. Is there anything else you want to ask? \nNana: My parents want me to marry. Should I? \nBaba: What is the hurry? Wait for two years, and then I will tell you what to do. \nLM8 p3044 \n\"We were in Satara. There were five of us and we were playing cards with Baba. It was \nevening time. I remember that because Baba had called the five of us to be with him at 5 or \n5.30, I don't remember the exact time. \n\"We all came, and Baba suggested a game of cards. We were playing and there was the usual \nsort of good-natured conversation going on concerning the cards, when Baba suddenly \nstopped the game and said that he wanted us to meditate. This took us all completely by \nsurprise. \n\"Baba must have seen how startled we were, because he began to explain how he wanted us \nto meditate. He said he would clap his hands three times. First we should go out into the \ncompound area, and each of us was to find a suitable spot to sit. When Baba clapped the first \ntime, we were supposed to settle down, relax, quiet ourselves and try to be calm. When we \nheard a second clap, we were to close our eyes and begin to meditate. And when we heard \nthe third clap, we were supposed to get up and return to Baba. \n\"But still we didn't have any idea how we should meditate, so Baba came to our rescue. \n'How will you meditate?' he asked us. 'To meditate you must think about God. But God is \ninfinite and eternal, so how will you be able to imagine this? You can't, it is beyond the mind. \n\"'So think of God as all-pervading effulgence. Try to bring before your mind's eye a picture \nof an ocean of infinite, all-pervading effulgence, which is God. A shoreless, bottomless \nocean.' \n\"Baba looked at us then and asked, 'But if this ocean of effulgence is infinite and all-\npervading, where will you be? What will your position be?' We had no answer for this, but \nBaba went on and said, 'If you imagine this ocean in front of you, then it is not infinite. So try \nto bring before your mind's eye this infinite ocean of effulgence, and imagine yourself in it. \nYou are in the midst of this infinite ocean of effulgence. Try to picture this when you \nmeditate.' \n\"So with these instructions we went outside, and we each found a place to sit, and got \nourselves comfortable as Baba had said. After a moment or two, I heard Baba's clap. I \nrelaxed and was breathing very evenly when, after some time, I heard Baba's second clap. \n\"I closed my eyes and began to try to meditate as he had just instructed us. I pictured an \ninfinite ocean of effulgence all around me, with me floating in the middle of it. The image \ncame easily to mind, and I found that quickly I had lost myself in this ocean. I was just \nbeginning to enjoy the feeling of being lost in the ocean. I don't know how much time had \nelapsed, it seemed like only a minute or two. I was just beginning to really enjoy the \nsensation when I heard Baba's clap again. So I opened my eyes and got up and rejoined \nBaba, as did the others. \n\"Baba told us, 'Don't ever meditate like that again,' and we resumed the card game. That \nwas the first and last time I ever meditated.\" \nEruch Jessawalla, DH p62-63 \nIvy Duce, a student of Rabia Martin, met Meher Baba in 1948 in  India. In November 1952 he \nsent her a charter of instructions for her group, which was to be called Sufism Reoriented. \nThe charter, which Baba signed, included meditation instructions for her students. \nIn the section 'Duties and Obligations' under the heading, \"It shall be the duty of every \nmember:\" Baba dictated, \n\"To necessarily repeat verbally daily one name of God for half an hour at any time of the day \nor night. This is to be done consecutively, if possible, but may be accomplished in smaller \nportions if necessary. \nTo meditate on the Master daily for fifteen minutes in any secluded spot.\" \nUnder the heading 'Special Duties' Baba dictated, \n\"Those who aspire to the final attainment should renounce everything and occupy \nthemselves in prayer and meditation most of the time.\" \n14 November 1952, Meherabad \nChartered Guidance from Meher Baba \nfor the Reorientation of Sufism as the \nHighway to the Ultimate Universalized, p7 \nFor more on meditation, see the chapters on meditation in DISCOURSES (p201-252 in the \nmost recent 7th edition). \nMeditation Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

Those who love \nGod, that love takes them within. In some ashrams like Madurai and  Pondicherry, there are \nactual meditation classes. But meditation has never yet made a person one with God. Hafez \nsaid to the Sufis, 'If you have the whim to achieve union with God, become as the dust at the \nfeet of one who has become united with him.' \n\"... Sufis do not give a damn for meditation.

    "text": "MIRACLES \nMeher Baba \nThere is electricity in the air, and it has seven layers, one inside the other. The power that \nthe yogis make use of comes from this unlimited source of cosmic energy in the air, from the \nthird layer inside. They combine the limited source of energy in their own body with this \nunlimited cosmic source by means of breath. The combination of these two powers enables \nthe yogis to bring about whatever result they desire. The yogis have only to think after \ncombining these two forces, limited and unlimited, and by certain yogic practices they \nachieve results such as raising the dead, reading other's minds, seeing things at a vast \ndistance, and so forth. \nFor example, if a yogi wishes to raise a dead body, or see certain places in America while \nsitting here in India, by yogic practises he has only to combine the sources of energy within \nhimself with that cosmic energy which is in the air. That done, the yogi has only to think of \nthe particular desire he wishes to fulfill. \nOn the other hand, a Sadguru does not have to exert himself in breathing or by exercises, as \ndo the yogis, but has only to think as he wishes and he achieves the result. What does it \nmatter to the Sadguru if someone is dead or alive? To him both are equally false, as both are \nmere dreams, illusion. The world is as he wishes, which is not the case with yogis. To them \nthe conditions that exist are real, and have therefore to change from one thing to another as \nthey desire. And it is for these changes that yogis exert themselves in performing different \nsadhanas, meditations and exercises. Although the powers they attain are tremendous, they \nare, after all, only rays of the sun, and not the sun itself, as is the Sadguru. \n27 November 1926, \nLonavla, \nLM3 p881 \n(Rustom Irani read out an article from a newspaper about a live snake being created from a \npiece of metal.) \nBaba: This is due to occult powers. But remember that it has nothing to do with ghosts. \nGhosts and occult or black magic are quite different. Spirit (mind and energy) itself, as in \nghosts, is a power, originally the power of cause. But occult powers are powers that are \ncaged and covered. \nA tantrik seeks occult powers. By acquiring such powers, the tantrik's spirit contracts very \nbad sanskaras, worse than the sanskaras of the worst sins, and reaps the fruit accordingly. \nSo I advise you all not to fall prey to such madness. This has no connection with the spiritual \nPath to God - the planes. On the contrary, the treader of such a path is far, far away from the \nspiritual Path, because he accumulates the worst possible kind of sanskaras, which prove an \nobstacle to his progress on the Path. \nThe less said about occult powers the better. This type of tantrik spirit, in comparison to \nghosts of suicides, is even more terrible, and neither receives nor gives benefit from his \nefforts. He gains occult powers through various studies, or by very undesirable practices - \nlike eating excrement, drinking blood, and other such obscene acts. \nThis type of tantrik practice takes a very long time, and the person concerned acquires only \nthe power of making his body large or small. He can make his body smaller than an ant's, \nand then assume his human bodily form again. But he changes into another form for some \nmaterial gain or objective. He can enter another's body by making his body small, but his \nown Gross bodily sanskaras are with him in his tiny form. \nGhosts are not like tantrik spirits. Ghosts are people who have committed suicide and have \nno body. They enter another body, and then make the body of whomsoever they enter do as \nthey wish. But he who has gained occult powers does not do so. He only makes his body big \nor small, and thus his bodily sanskaras are always with him. In this action there is also the \ndanger that, through some accident, he may be trampled on by some person while in his \nlittle body. \nIn short, after long and hard study, such tantriks (magicians, sorcerers) do not benefit in \nany way, but on the contrary, risk contracting some of the worst possible sanskaras. So \nthere is no use in playing such a worthless game of magic - sorcery. \n15 December 1927, \nAhmednagar, \nLM3 p993-994 \nRustom Irani: If you would perform a miracle, thousands of people would come to your feet. \nBaba, you should raise an incredible tower here in one night, higher and grander than the \nKutub Minar in  Delhi. If you do it, millions would come to you and accept you as a Perfect \nMaster, God in human form. How will people believe in you without your proving your \npowers? \nBaba: Have you ever heard of any Sadguru or the Avatar having performed such a feat? The \neffect of such a miracle would be disastrous. \nYou think millions would approach me and enter the spiritual Path. You are right in a way. \nThere would be no limit to their numbers, and they would come to revere me. But so many \nwould come full of worldly desires they wished to have fulfilled. \nThose who needed money would say, 'You have raised such a big minaret in one night, why \ndon't you give us a few thousand rupees by your powers?' Some would come in the hope of \nmy relieving them of their suffering. Others would come with a desire to be freed of their \nworldly entanglements. \nIt would reach such an extent that those who really wanted to live a life of renunciation \nwould approach me thinking I should tell them to stop all the austerities and penances \nwhich they must undergo, and give them Liberation by my miracle. \nThey wouldn't come to me for myself, or out of love for me, they would come out of their \nlove for miracles, and would as a result achieve nothing. This whole world is an illusion, and \na miracle is an illusion into illusion. \n15 February 1929, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1139-1140 \nQ. Your followers attribute numerous miracles to you. \nBaba: Anyone who becomes one with the Truth can accomplish anything. But it is weakness \nto perform a miracle simply to show one's spiritual powers. Jesus Christ, who made the \nblind to see and the deaf to hear, who restored the dead to life, did nothing to save himself \nfrom suffering the agony of the world. The only miracle for the Perfect man to perform is to \nmake others Perfect too. I want to make the Americans realise the infinite state which I \nmyself enjoy. \n20 March 1932, \nNasik, \nto an Associated Press \ncorrespondent named Mills, \nLM5 p15414 \nAnother version of the same quote (?): \nThe only real miracle for a Perfect One is to make others Perfect too, to make them realise \nthe infinite state which he himself enjoys. That is a real miracle... otherwise, miracles have \nnothing to do with Truth at all. \n1932, PM p272 \nThe ability to perform miracles does not connote high spirituality. \n19 May 1932, \nNew York, \nMe p87 \nAll miracles are child's play, whereas spirituality is far above them. Miracles in themselves \nhave no spiritual value or significance. But they are necessary, and at times are performed \nby the Master as a means to convince people of Truth and spirituality. Jesus performed \nmiracles, not for his own gain, but to make people recognise the Truth and create faith in \nthem. Yet, when he was crucified, he who could raise the dead did not stop it. \n13 March 1937, \nNasik, \nto a Catholic priest, \nLM6 p2130 \nThrough different yogas one can attain strange occult powers such as walking on water, \ntalking with persons who are at a distance, becoming immune to snake venom through \nchanting mantras, etc. These powers, attained through yoga, control different vibrations \nwhich have different effects. Each yogi controls one particular vibration through which he is \nable to perform certain feats impossible for an ordinary human being. \nBut the peculiarity of this yogic power is that it can control only one particular vibration. So \na yogi, who through his control of a certain vibration can walk on water, can do nothing else. \nLikewise, one who can nullify the effects of the poison of a snake bite can do nothing other \nthan that. All these different powers attained through yoga practises are phenomenal, and \nhence transient and unreal. These have nothing to do with spirituality or spiritual powers, \nwhich are already latent in all, but manifest only in a few select ones who have realised the \nself. \nAll life depends on certain Subtle vibrations (Pran. Their connection is more universal \nthrough the Ether (fine gas). For instance, a yogi wants to obtain a certain connection to \nsomething which he desires. Just as there are infinite varieties of things in the Gross world, \nso there are an infinite variety of things in the Subtle realm. A yogi gets hold of one of these \nthings (powers) and gains control over the vibration pertaining to that particular thing. The \nspiritualists -- true spiritual aspirants, saints and Masters -- do not indulge in these petty \nplaythings, because once Realisation of God is attained, all powers come to him and \nemanate from him. It is all bliss, which he himself experiences, and that bliss permeates \neverything and flows from none other than himself. \n11 July 1944, \nRaipur, \nLM8 p2959 \nWhy should we produce petty imitation illusions in the already created mighty infinite \nillusion? Unless absolutely necessary for the spiritual purpose of a general collective \ndrawing of mankind towards Self-realisation, miracles performed unnaturally or \nsupernaturally can interfere with God's ordained evolutionary process. \nReal healing is spiritual healing, whereby the soul, becoming free from desires, doubts and \nhallucinations, enjoys the eternal bliss of God. Untimely physical healing might retard the \nspiritual healing. If borne willingly, physical and mental suffering can make one worthy of \nreceiving spiritual healing. Consider mental and physical suffering as gifts from God, which, \nif accepted gracefully, lead to everlasting happiness. \nc.1952? \nPL p31 \n... For ages and ages, the atma (soul) has been seeing its own shadow and getting engrossed \nin the illusory world of forms. He gets addicted to the spectacle of his own creation, and \ndesires to see it through cycles and cycles of creation. \nWhen the soul turns inwards and longs to have self-knowledge, it has become spiritually-\nminded. But even there, this habit of wanting to see some spectacle persists for several \nlives. The soul wants to experience some miracles or spectacular phenomena. Or in more \nadvanced stages, it wants to perform miracles and manipulate phenomena. \nEven spiritually advanced persons find it difficult to outgrow this habit of playing with \nillusions. Persistent attachment to miracles is only a further continuation of the habit of \nplaying with illusion. It is not miracles, but understanding, which can bring you true \nfreedom. \nIf you have firm faith and unfaltering love for the God-man, your way to the abiding truth is \nclear and safe. Then you have no time to waste in playing with things that do not matter. \nBe ye guided by love and truth. This is the simple way that leads to God.. Not by endless \nmaneuvering of alluring illusions, but by loyalty to the unchangeable truth, can ye hope to \nbe established in abiding peace... \nFebruary 1954? \nGl Feb. 1978, p21. \nAlso MD p2-3 \nBaba: Today I shall explain why I think that, from the spiritual point of view, miracles are \nnothing but farce. Jesus said, 'I and my Father are one.' He meant that he was and is God. \nThis is true. He was and is God. Now, God is said to have created all this phenomenal \nuniverse. This is God's miracle, and therefore the miracle of Jesus. It means innumerable \nbeings created and destroyed according to his will. Yet they lay down that Jesus' greatest \nmiracle was in raising a few dead to life. How ridiculous it sounds, unless it is given some \ninner meaning. Raising the dead to life is insignificant illusion amidst his greatest illusion, \nand to say that Jesus was Saviour because he raised the dead is ridiculous. But he did raise \nthe dead to life, and many other miracles. Why did he do it? \n(Someone suggested that it was a means of impressing people.) \nBaba: You are saying, in effect, I am God, I am Saviour, I am everything - and people are not \nimpressed. In other words, people are not impressed with my self but with miracles. Now, \nwhy did he do it? If he had not raised the dead, take it from me, he would not have been \ncrucified, and he wanted this. \nSeptember 1954, \nMeherabad, TK p345 \nThere are yogis (those who practise a systematic course of esoteric knowledge) who can, of \nthemselves, suspend their physical bodies in mid-air during the time they are in a \ntemporary samadhi (trance). There are some who can bodily walk on water or fly in the air \nwithout the aid of external means. And yet all this is no sign or proof of their having \nexperienced divine love. Weighed on spiritual scales these miracles have no value \nwhatsoever. In fact, miracle-mongering by the average yogi is not only poles apart from the \nspiritual Path, but is actually a hindrance to the individual's evolution towards spiritual \nprogress. \nThe following incident in the life of a Hindu Master shows the disregard in which it is held \nby Perfect Masters, who are Truth personified. The Master was one day by the river's edge, \nwaiting for one of the little ferry boats that take passengers across the stream for the \ndiminutive fare of one anna. A yogi, seeing him thus waiting, came up to him, literally \nwalked across the river and back, and said, 'That was much easier, was it not?' The Master \nsmilingly replied, 'Yes, and had less value than that of the boat fare - one anna.\" \nc.1954? GS p72-73 \nThe miracles of a Saviour* are of a universal character, and are performed when universally \nnecessary. When a Saviour intends working a miracle, he stations himself on the 6th, 5th or \n4th plane as demanded by circumstances. When, however, it is desired that the miracles be \nvery forceful, he stations himself on the 4th plane. \n*Saviour = Avatar \nThe miracles of a Perfect Master are on a very large scale, but they do not cover the whole \nuniverse. Like the Saviour's miracles, however, they are wrought solely for the spiritual \nawakening of others. Like the Saviour also, the Perfect Master who intends working a \nmiracle stations himself on the 6th, 5th or 4th plane for the time being; and for a very \nforceful miracle, he stations himself for the time being on the 4th plane. No miracles are \never wrought by the Majzoob-e-Kamil of the 7th plane for the simple reason that the three \nspheres, the Mental, Subtle and Gross, do not exist for such a soul. \nThe miracles of a Pir or Wali* are on a limited scale. In fact, they perform no miracles \ndirectly. However, such miracles as can be attributed to them are wrought from their \nmental influence over the thoughts and feelings of others, yielding both spiritual and \nmaterial benefits. They do not come down to the 4th plane - the plane of almighty spiritual \npowers. \n*A Pir is on the 6th plane; a Wali is on the 5th plane. \nPilgrims of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd planes can use or demonstrate powers from their own \nplane, such as reading the minds of others, producing things from nowhere, reciting words \nor passages from a book without seeing it, stopping trains, allowing themselves to be buried \nalive for hours together, levitation, etc., etc. These are actual powers acquired by the pilgrim \non the different planes, and as such, cannot be called mere jugglery. Perfect Masters and the \nAvatar can snatch away a pilgrim's ability to use the powers from the lower planes, viz. 1st, \n2nd and 3rd, and can even snatch away the almighty  powers of one on the 4th plane. Such a \nsnatching away of powers of those on the lower planes is known to the Sufis as salb-e-\nwilayat. \nOn the 4th plane are stored all the almighty powers* which, if misused by the pilgrim, result \nin utter ruin. But such miracles do not affect the world adversely, because the Qutub-e-\nIrshad - the head of the spiritual hierarchy of the age - takes care to make these actions \nineffective. \n*One on the 4th plane is known as a Mahayogi (a great yogi). \n... The indiscriminate display of powers by a pilgrim of the first three planes is fraught with \nserious dangers, but... one who misuses the powers of the 4th plane invariably falls back to \nthe lowest phase of evolution - the stone state... \nThe miracles wrought by Saviours and Perfect Masters have a divine motive behind them, \nand may be either voluntary or involuntary. The voluntary miracles of a Saviour or Perfect \nMaster are those that he deliberately performs by the expression and force of his will, and \nthe involuntary ones are those that occur independently of the will of the Saviour or Perfect \nMaster, and are wrought by means of the ever-active force that surrounds these great \nbeings. In the latter type of miracle, the Saviour or Perfect Master is unaware of the \nincidents of the miracle of which he himself is the source and prime cause. Both voluntary \nand involuntary miracles of these Perfect Ones are nevertheless always directed towards \nthe spiritual awakening of the world... \nThe miraculous powers of a Perfect Master appear the same as those of a yogi of the 4th \nplane, but there is this important difference, that the powers of a Perfect Master are his \nown, because he is power itself. He has simply to will a thing and it is done. 'Be, and it was' \n(Kun faya kun) refers, according to the Sufis, to the divine manifestation of power. \nThe yogis' powers, however, are not their own, and they have to depend on extraneous \nsources of power for working miracles. The inherent powers of Perfect Masters are \ncontinually overflowing, and yogis and pilgrims of the lower planes borrow these \noverflowing powers and work miracles with them... \nIn Fana-Fillah (the Majzoob state) there are no miracles, direct or indirect. In Divine \nJunction (Turiya Avastha or Muqum-e-Furutat) the Jivanmukta (Azad-e-Mutlaq) has no \nduty, and performs no miracles. But there is always a possibility of miracles happening \nthrough the Jivanmukta without his being aware of it. The Agents or pilgrims of the lower \nplanes very often borrow his powers and work miracles with them, but the powers of the \nJivanmukta are not in any way lessened thereby. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1955, \nGS p222-226 \nSpirituality and spiritualism are two different things. Spirituality has nothing to do with any \nkind of power in any form. Spirituality is the path of love for God and obedience and \nsurrender to the Perfect Master. As one travels on the Path, one comes across powers on the \nplanes of consciousness. Those on the planes from first to fourth are sometimes tempted to \ndemonstrate these powers. \nThere are three kinds of powers: \n1. The divine powers of the fourth plane. \n2. The occult powers of the first three planes of consciousness. These are called the mystic \npowers. \n3. Other occult powers. \n1. The divine powers of the fourth plane are the almighty powers of God. They are the \nsource of all powers, whether mystic or other occult powers. \nThe mystic and other occult powers are infinitely insignificant in comparison with the \ndivine powers. \nThe divine powers remain always the same because God is always one and the same. The \noccult powers, whether they are of the planes or not, are different in kind and vary in \nexpression. \nThe miracles performed through the manifestation of the divine powers by the Avatar and \nthe Qutub are called Mojezat. These are performed for the good of all - on a limited scale by \nthe Qutub, and on a universal scale by the Avatar. However, these can be performed for any \nindividual in close association with the Avatar or the Qutub. \nThe miracles performed indirectly by those on the fifth and sixth planes with the help of the \ndivine powers are called Karamaat. \nThe display of the mystic powers by those on the first up through the third plane cannot in \nfact be termed miracles. Such a display is nothing but a show of powers that they come \nacross while traversing the planes. Such a display of powers is called Shobada. \nWhen one on the fourth plane makes good use of the divine powers and performs a miracle, \nit can be termed as Karamat-e-Mojeza. When he makes bad use of them, i.e., misuses the \ndivine powers of the fourth plane, it is termed Mojeza-e-Shobada. \nThe fourth plane is regarded as the 'threshold' of the Mental sphere, and so the misuse of \nthe divine powers on the fourth plane results in a 'fall' as far back as the stone-state, and \nresults in disintegration of consciousness. \n2. The occult powers of the first three planes, called the mystic powers, cannot be misused \nby the aspirant on these planes, though they sometimes are tempted to display them. These \nmystic powers are different, and vary in expression, such as: Reading the minds of others; \nReciting words or passages from a book without seeing it; Allowing themselves to be buried \nalive for hours together, etc. \nThe powers of the planes are not induced. These powers are ever accessible to those on the \nplanes, within their own limited environment, and as such, need no concentrated effort to \ndisplay them. This display of powers should not be confused with the demonstrations of \nmind readers and of others who put on stage performances. \nThe one on the third plane of consciousness can raise dead sub-human creatures, but can \nnever make a dead human being alive. This he can do because of the nearness too and \n'warmth' of the divine powers on the fourth plane. \nBut one on the fourth plane can raise the dead, including human beings, by the use of the \ndivine powers of the fourth plane. \nThe one on the third plane can change his physical form at will, and one who does this is \nknown as Abdal. This act is also a display of the mystic powers, but not the misuse of \npowers. However, this act should not be confused with the dematerialisation or \nmaterialisation of the human forms by the tantriks. \n3. Other occult powers have nothing to do with spirituality, or with the mystic powers of the \nplanes. These occult powers are of two types: \na. Superior occult powers \nb. Inferior occult powers \nThe one who has these occult powers can make good or bad use of the same. Good use of \noccult powers helps one to put himself on the planes of the Path, and may even make one a \nMahayogi. Bad use of these occult powers makes one suffer intensely in the next human \nform. Good use of superior occult powers puts one on the fifth plane of consciousness after \nfour lives (reincarnations). \na. Superior types of occult powers are derived from tantrik exercises such as chilla-nashini, \nor repetition of certain mantras, etc. \nThe one who holds these powers can perform the so-called miracles such as levitation, \nflying and floating in the air, dematerialisation and materialisation, etc. \nInferior types of occult powers need no tantrik or any special exercises. They are had \nthrough sanskaras of past lives. For example: if someone has done certain good deeds many \ntimes in the past, his next incarnation may give him the faculty of inferior occult powers \nwithout undergoing any strenuous exercises. His sanskaras give him the faculty of inferior \noccult powers such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, healing, producing sweets or money \nseemingly out of nothing, etc. \nAll such capabilities form part of the lower or inferior type of occult powers. \nIf one makes good use of the inferior type of occult powers, he derives superior type of \noccult powers in his next life without undergoing any tantrik exercises. Likewise, the one \nwho puts to good use his faculty of hypnotism gains the superior type of occult powers in \nhis next life. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1955, \nGS p229-232 \nNo miracle is an exception to the existing laws of the universe. It is an overt result of the \nimpersonal working or conscious use of the established laws of the inner spheres. It is \ncalled a miracle because it cannot be explained by the known laws of the Gross world. Here, \nknown laws are superimposed by unknown laws. It is not a case of chaos or lawlessness. \nThere are many examples of miracles. Giving sight to the blind and kindred achievements \nare brought under the category of miracles. They do not set aside the laws of the universe, \nbut are the expressions of laws and forces unknown and inaccessible to most human beings. \nThere are some persons who, through the use of their supernatural powers, can keep their \nbodies alive for hundreds of years, although they are not necessarily spiritually advanced. In \nthe same way, the lingering aura of a saint may work miracles from his burial place. \nThe scope of miracles is very wide. Even the animal world is not exempt from the possibility \nof miracles. Though mammals such as porpoises and other animals do not have a fully \ndeveloped Subtle body, there is in the Subtle world an equivalent or counterpart of their \nGross forms. The rudimentary Subtle matrix, which has yet to develop into a definite and \nfunctionally self-sufficient Subtle form, can still serve some purposes and become a medium \nfor performance of miracles. Stories of sorcerers who caused schools of porpoises to come \nfrom the open sea to shore for a native feast are within the bounds of probability. But all \nthis realm of the supernatural, occult, miraculous and magic (black or white) must be \nregarded as having no spiritual value in itself. \nOccult phenomena like stigmata, telekinesis (effecting the flight of objects such as a \ncommunion wafer through the air), elongation, elevation, etc., may amuse, astound or \noverpower people. But they cannot bring about spiritual healing or uplift, which is the real \nthing that matters. They are just an illustration of the supersession of ordinary and known \nlaws of nature by the supernatural and unknown laws of the inner spheres. The curious \nmight very well occupy their minds with these things, but they are best relegated to the \nbackground as insignificant. The real lover of Truth passes by these things without \nbecoming entangled with any of them. He cannot afford to be distracted or diverted from his \nreal objective: attaining union with God, and releasing the radiance of his purity and love. \nThe apparent anomaly of miracles does not constitute the violation of known natural laws, \nbut means only their supersession by other unknown laws. It also does not mean violation \nof the higher karmic laws which supervene upon natural as well as supernatural laws. \nHowever, among the supervening orders in the spiritual panorama, there is one important \nfactor which transcends and controls all laws, including the supernatural laws and the laws \nof karma. That factor is divine grace, which is beyond all laws. \n... The only miracle which is worthy of the name is the divine grace that knows no fetters, \nand that can control the entire universe with all of its laws. It is the last supervening factor \nin the graded orders which obtain in the spiritual panorama. Divine grace is not concerned \nwith phenomena. It is concerned with the emancipation and spiritual fulfillment of souls... \n...The God-man... may, if he deems it to be fit and necessary, perform numberless miracles in \nsupervention of the normal routine working of the universe, without attaching any especial \nimportance to them. \n1956?

Gas in a very fine state one \ndiscovers in the Subtle world as Pran. The vibration of Ether, Gross gas in a fine state, one \ndiscovers in the Gross world through deep concentration. \nA yogi who attains the vibration of Ether does not need to eat Gross food, and the ether \nvibrations help him to maintain his body. A yogi can thus live on Ether alone. Similarly \npoets, music composers, writers and artists also attain vibrations of Subtle inspiration \ntemporarily. From the Subtle world inspiration comes to them, and they feel inspired to \nwrite music, poems, epics and create art; but they do not attain permanent experience, \nwhich can only be experienced in the Subtle planes through the transformation into Subtle \nconsciousness. \nTherefore the yogis attain a different vibration (than the inspiration of artists) from the \nSubtle world, but can only feel one vibration, and that too, temporarily - but in a more \nconcentrated form as a power (siddhi). Although temporary, the vibration that the yogi \nholds in his own body can last a long time - centuries. \n\"If any yogi observes fast for fourteen days to as many as forty days along with a specific \n(secret) penance, the yogi can hold Ether-vibrations, and then there is no need for his body \nto eat food. The yogi can live on earth for centuries without food, but such yogis are rare in \nthis age. There were several such yogis in ancient times. \n\"On one occasion in the 1950s, Meher Baba indicated that there are three such yogis living \nin the Himalayas and Tibet who have been in the same body for the past 600 years. In order \nfor the yogi to hold in his body the Ether vibrations from the Subtle world requires a certain \nspecific penance and fast of fourteen to as many as forty days. This penance is kept secret \namong the old yogis. Attempting such penance is not recommended.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM 8 p2959fn (footnotes) \nBaba directed four men to live in seclusion at Meherabad. One of them, Manekar, had a \nnumber of inner experiences. One experience was a light in his darkened room that was so \nbright he could read by it. Baba was told of this, and expressed pleasure, explaining, \n\"This is not spirituality. Such phenomena are only a medium to attract the pilgrim to the \nPath. One should not be fooled and get ensnared. There is danger in the enchantment.\" \nJanuary 1928, Meherabad, LM3 p1010 \n\"There was once a government official who sent a messenger to Ahmednagar. Baba was in \nseclusion, and the messenger gave me a note from the minister addressed to Baba. It was \nmy task to read it first. It was written: \n\"'Beloved Meher Baba: I am suffering very much. I do not know what I should do. I have a \nhigh position. I do not lack status or money. But in my family there is a situation which is \nvery painful to me. It is beyond my power to correct it and restore the happiness which I \nenjoyed before.' \n\"I asked the man to sit in my office while I took the letter to Meher Baba. Baba listened very \ncarefully as I read it to him. He said, \n\"'Tell this messenger who has come on behalf of the official that I do not perform miracles. I \ndo not change circumstances. But there is one thing that is certain: my spiritual status is so \nhigh, so great, that if any man in any difficulty, in any corner of the world, at any time, \nremembers me with all his heart, then the difficulty is immediately solved.' \n\"It is a distance of nine miles from Meherazad to my office. The messenger was eagerly \nwaiting for me. I gave him Meher Baba's message. This messenger was a very intelligent \nman. The moment I gave him Meher Baba's message, he asked the first question: 'Sir, what \ndo you mean by remembering Meher Baba with all one's heart? Please explain.' \n\"Baba had not told me how to explain the meaning of remembering him with all one's heart. \nBut I remembered something Baba had said before, and I explained it to the messenger in a \nvery beautiful manner. I gave him the instance of a man swimming in the water who is \nabout to be eaten by a big fish. He does not know what will happen in the next second. He is \nso frightened that he almost becomes unconscious. At that moment he remembers God; he \nremembers Meher Baba. 'O Meher Baba, save my life!' This is the meaning of remembering \nhim with all your heart. \n\"The messenger was very satisfied with this answer. He went home, and of course told the \nwhole story to the minister. And within fifteen days I got a letter that everything had been \nsmoothed out.\" \nAdi K. Irani, JT p14-15 (after 1947) \n(From a talk by Adi K. Irani: Baba's words may not be exact) \nA person on the higher planes gets certain powers. On the first three planes these are called \nmystic powers, and they include being able to read the minds of others, recite words or \npassages from a book without seeing it, allowing oneself to be buried alive for hours, \nproducing things from nowhere, stopping trains, levitation, etc. On the third plane one can \nraise dead sub-human creatures. The powers of the fourth plane are called divine powers, \nand include the ability to raise the dead, including human beings, and to create new living \nforms in new worlds. A person on the fifth plane can control the thoughts of others. A \nperson on the sixth plane can control the feelings of others. A person on the seventh plane \nwho regains consciousness of creation has unlimited powers, but being desireless, has no \ninclination to use the infinite powers except (on rare occasions) for the spiritual benefit of \nothers. \nThe exercise of powers is not a sign of spiritual advancement. Some occult powers have \nnothing to do with spirituality. They are the result of good sanskaras of past lives. These are \ncalled minor occult powers, and include clairvoyance, clairaudience, healing, producing \nsweets or money seemingly out of nothing, etc. Other powers can be attained through \ntantric exercises. These are called major occult powers, and they include levitation, flying \nand floating in the air, dematerialisation and materialisation, etc. \nEditor \nFor more about occult powers and the powers of the inner planes, see Di p191, 196-200; NE \np67-98, LM3 p881, LM8 p2959 and fn, and GS p123-131, 222-232.

The only real love is the love for this infinity (God), which arouses an intense longing to \nsee, know and become one with its truth (God). \n3. The only real sacrifice is that in which, in pursuance of this love, all things, body, mind, \nposition, welfare, and even life itself, are sacrificed. \n4. The only real renunciation is that which abandons, even in the midst of worldly duties, all \nselfish thoughts and desires. \n5. The only real knowledge is the knowledge that God is the inner dweller in good people \nand so-called bad, in saint and so-called sinner. This knowledge requires you to help all \nequally as circumstances demand, without expectation of reward, and when compelled to \ntake part in a dispute, to act without the slightest trace of enmity or hatred; to try to make \nothers happy with brotherly or sisterly feeling for each one; to harm no one in thought, \nword or deed, not even those who harm you. \n6. The only real control is the discipline of the senses from indulgence in low desires, which \nalone ensures absolute purity of character. \n7. The only real surrender is that in which the poise is undisturbed by any adverse \ncircumstance, and the individual, amidst every kind of hardship, is resigned with perfect \ncalm to the will of God. \n9 January 1941, \nJaipur, Me p12 \nOther versions: Di (7th ed.) p1-2, \nLM7 p2654 - *in this version, \nthe first line is: \"Meher Baba's teaching gives no importance to...\" \nBhau Kalchuri wrote: \n\"This message was especially significant, because, for the first time, Baba ordered \nthousands of copies of it printed and then sent to his disciples and followers throughout \nIndia in order for them to distribute wherever they lived. Dr. Ghani and Adi Sr. in Bangalore \nheaded up the printing and distribution task, and thousands and thousands of copies of this \nmessage were handed out throughout India, and then sent to Europe and America in the \nbeginning months of 1941.

It doesn't look proper to distribute \nbooklets when you are the Avatar. \nBaba: If the Avatar has to resort to distributing leaflets, it shows the shocking condition \npeople have come to. Yet I have to do it. It is the preliminary preparation. This is the \nbeginning. I'm preparing the ground. \nYou are fools. This war was preceded by correspondence. Meetings were held. Thereafter, \nthere were protests and opposition. Then when the war started, and all these were of no \navail, the bombs came. \nSo these explanations of mine about the war are a sort of communication, to give the public \na chance to listen and improve. If they won't, then there will be spiritual bombs. Don't you \nknow me after so many years of contact? One who does not care for the world, and publicly \ndeclares in America, 'I will come here and speak,' and does not -- don't you understand him \nyet? I do not care what the world will think or say. I will do anything for the sake of my \nwork. Even if the whole world goes against me, I will do what I have to do. But all in its time. \nI will teach and strike, both. \nBut India nowadays is sadly lacking in spirituality, by indulging in too much politics and \nmaya. The old spiritual glory is gone. It is sad, yet it is a fact. \nDecember 1939, \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2484-2485 \nAll the meditations, yogas, concentrations do not teach what Baba teaches you through \neveryday living. That is, to be kind to those who ill-treat you, and to love those you dislike. \nThis is the highest practice of yoga. \nWhen Christ was mocked, spat upon and beaten, he did not use his powers, but he retaliated \nwith love. \nYou should be glad of an opportunity to be mistreated by others. You should thank them for \nthe opportunity of suffering and loving. The purpose of your being with Baba is to eliminate \nthe ego. \n1930s? T p94 \nChrist said, 'Leave all and follow me.' What did he mean by that? He didn't mean leave the \nbody, food, sleep and all that. No - he meant leave all thoughts of possessions, all worldly \nthoughts, and think only of him. \nThink of me to such an extent that you see me, however far away I may be. You see my body \nhere now. However far away my body may be, you will be able to see me physically also. In \nIndia, some love me to such an extent that they see me physically present, although I am \nthousands of miles away from them. \n22 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p30-31 \nI have been telling the same message throughout the ages, that all are one. We are all one, \nand all of you love me. \nI am in everything, and everything is in me. In India, I bow down to the lepers, the poor, the \nlame. Why do I bow down? Because I am one with everything. God is in everyone. \nAge after age I have been bringing the same message, but mankind does not listen. Christ \nwas crucified; otherwise humanity would not have listened to him. I am the Ancient one. \n23 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:3 p15 \nI have been made to take this human form by the five Perfect Masters of this age to bear the \ncross and to undergo humiliation. \nYou have read in the Gospels wherein Christ had said to his apostles, \"You will deny me.\" \nThis did happen when Peter, the chief apostle, denied Jesus. \nThe thing is that during the phase of humilation, the circumstances will so array themselves \nthat you won't be aware when my daaman has slipped off your hands. At that time, you may \neven feel justified in leaving me. But if you feel that this should not happen, there is one \nremedy. You should grasp well all that I say, and understandingly act up to it. You should \nalso tell all of what you hear today to those who are not present. \nIn short, I clearly see the dark cloud. I do not wish to make a mere mention of the dark cloud \nwithout any reason, but this is my loving warning to you so that my daaman may not slip off \nyour hands. \n19 May or 2 June 1957, \nPoona \nBG p16, \nalso Gl May 1980 \nA follower of Meher Baba told him that for a week he had been thinking he should not visit \nBaba, for he was worried that Baba was a hoax. Baba told him, \n\"The time for breaking my silence is very near. It is during this time that there are great \nchances of my daaman slipping from your hands. Maya will try to take you away from me. \n\"What does it matter if I am a hoax? I am everything, the highest of the high as well as the \nlowest. But do not stop coming here even if you feel that I am a hoax. Do not go hunting for \nother masters or saints... The whole world is a hoax, not I.\" \nThe next day Baba told him, \n\"Judas grew up with Christ, and yet betrayed him in the end. Peter, who was the apostle of \nChrist, also denied Jesus. So why worry if you get such thoughts about me? Stick to me, and \ndo not leave my daaman till at least the first of January. Do not go to any saint. Come here \ndaily for fifteen days, and your mind will be free of all such thoughts.\" \n25 & 26 May 1963, \nPoona, \nAw 10:1 p24 \nA lawyer: Why don't you prove what you claim to be? \nBaba (smiling): The Creator, who is limitless, formless and unbounded, is not bound to \nprove to his own creation that he is the Creator. It's for the creation to know, find and \nrealise the Creator. A father never even dreams of proving to his own son that he is his real \nfather. In spite of this, if the son doubts him, naturally he tries to search for his real father, \nand ultimately the son is convinced that what his father has said was true. \nYou talk of open miracles. Do you take me to be a madari (magician)? Jesus Christ was \npublicly humiliated, stoned, spat upon by the ignorant ones. This his lovers... could not bear \nto see, and they persuaded Jesus to perform open miracles to pacify the people. Jesus was \nreluctant to do so, yet, not to displease his lovers, he openly performed miracles (raising the \ndead, giving sight to the blind, etc.). What happened? He was accused as a magician, tried, \nfound guilty and crucified. \nIf I am really what I claim to be, do you think it's essential on my part to do such things? \nWhen God, who as I said is formless, takes a form in a mortal human body to awaken people \nwhen they need awakening, few accept him, and whatever he says is laughed at. But the \nsame God (whom a very few fortunate ones have realised) without form is faithfully and \nconvincingly accepted. \nAs I have often said, this body is not really what I claim to be, and these childish questions \nsimply amuse me. \nGod needs your intense love. He wants you to become dust in his love, instead of defying \nhim. It's better to deny God than to defy him... \nGod's ways are mysterious, and he alone understands his mystery. \"Khuda ki baten khuda hi \njane - God alone knows and understands his language.\" \nBG p12-13, \nalso Gl Nov. 1976 \nBack to top",

Complications are not \nnatural to unity, because duality is based on complications. \nBooks, philosophies, and different terms all lead to confusion and contradiction if not \napplicable to one's spiritual tendency. \nGod-realisation means living in and with God in every thought and action -- to be so \nspontaneous as to naturally express divinity through every thought and deed consciously. It \nis divinely and consciously automatic. \nWhen you are asleep or awake, conscious or unconscious, eating or not, with people or \nalone, amidst activities or in solitude, you continue breathing automatically.  Your breath is \nconstant and always with you. So must God be in and with you  automatically, and at the \nsame time consciously, in every aspect of your life. It is to be simple, practical and livable in \nthe ordinary run of life, natural and easy to maintain in all your worldly activities. \nBelief, trust and faith are all illusory phenomena if not based on conviction through \npersonal experience. Ignorant persons seek to point out the faults and weaknesses in others \ninstead of finding them in themselves. And for some, to criticise Truth is their life's work, for \nwhen they fail to gain it, they grow despondent and turn against it. \nThe apparent is not real. Under many a life's complicated problems are hidden some of the \nsimplest truths, which the veil of ignorance obscures from human vision. \nDo not bother about believing in me. Be prepared to believe in your own self. Have faith in \nyour own capacity for longing for Truth. Only then will you know Truth in its pure and \ninfinite simplicity. Only then will you come to know who I am. \nMeher Baba, 18 November 1937 \nto some passengers on the ship \nCircassia en route from \nMarseilles to Bombay, \nLM6 p2237 \nBack to top",

He was 60 years old, and told Baba, \n\"Although I have had many minor turning points in my life, I feel today that the main \nturning point of my life has at last arrived by meeting you.\" \nBaba smiled and told him, \n\"The turning point has to arrive in the life of everyone, as it has arrived in your case now. It \nis like a war. Every day, every hour, and every minute of man's life, it is a sort of minor war -\n- petty scuffles -- between mind and heart, emotion and intellect, good and bad. And when \nthese individual conflicts spread out and develop, the collective result eventually takes the \nshape of a big worldwide war, which can never be avoided by any number of peace \nconferences, unless and until the very root cause is removed.\" \nThe man asked, \"Should I hurry up affairs, or go steady?\" \nBaba: Slowly, step by step. \nMan: Should I continue what I am doing now? \nBaba: Yes. It is all right. Only if you do it with confidence, because whatever one does with \nconfidence has the desired result. Even things which apparently are bad, if done with the \nright motive, bear good results, because in that very action selflessness exists. \n24 June 1934, \nParis, A p55-56 \nanother version LM6 p1879 \nQ. I am concerned about the grave crisis coming over in the near future, and wish to ask you \nif there is going to be another war. \nBaba: Yes, there will be another war... and what a war! But it will be nothing but a turning \npoint. \nBefore the major turning point -- worldwide -- there are minor turning points. For example, \ntake war. Before the actual war between nations, with arms and ammunition on a large, \nworldwide scale takes place in the near future, people have minor wars to undergo -- \nquarrels -- a war -- conflict -- between mind and heart, emotion and intellect, good and evil. \nAlso economic war all over, all these gradually growing to such an extent as to develop into \na great, major war, like the last World War. And rest assured, there will be one in the future. \nQ. And that will demand my duty towards my country. Shall I stick to it? \nBaba: Yes. Duty always stands first, whatever it is. And the very feeling and desire for duty \nmeans spirituality, because it is selflessness and sincerity of heart that calls for duty. \nThe man asked for Baba's help, and Baba told him, \"I will help you spiritually.\" \n1934? Europe? A p56-57 \nBack to top \nTWENTY-ONE POINTS \n1. God is absolutely independent. The only way to approach him is through love, constant \nrepetition of his name, and invocation of his mercy. \n2. Mercy is God's nature (swabhav). \n3. Bliss is God's original state (assal halat). \n4. Power is God's existence (astitva). \n5. Knowledge is God's duty (kartavya). \n6. The infinite state of God gets lost in the infinite jumble of infinite contradictions. \n7. To know God in his infinite contradictions is to become conscious of his consciousness of \nhis unconsciousness. \n8. To achieve the God-state, do absolutely nothing while doing everything. \n9. To find God, you must find yourself lost to yourself. \n10. To be infinitely conscious, you must consciously lose consciousness of yourself. \n11. Space is the gulf between imagination and reality. Evolution of consciousness fills this \ngulf. \n12. Time is the interval between your most-first imagination and your most-last \nimagination. \n13. Where imagination ends, God is, and Godhood begins. \n14. Imagination is an eternal mimicry of reality effecting the shadow-play of illusion. \n15. God is not anything comprehensible. He is reality: consciousness -- absolute \nconsciousness -- infinite consciousness. \n16. Realisation of God is absolute consciousness minus consciousness of imagination being \nimagination. \n17. To be ever present with God, never be absent from him. \n18. Do not desire union with God, but long for union till you go beyond longing for union , \nand long for only the will and pleasure of beloved God. \n19. \"Mind may die. Maya may die. Body dies and dies. But hope and thirst never die. Thus \nhas said the slave Kabir.\" \n20. Complete forgetfulness of self is to even forget that you have forgotten. \n21. Complete remembrance of God, honesty in action, making no one unhappy, being the \ncause of happiness in others, and no submission to low, selfish, lustful desires, while living a \nnormal worldly life, can lead one to the Path of God-realisation. But complete obedience to \nthe God-man brings one directly to God. \n2 November 1962, \nPoona, \nDV 2:2 p28-29 \nBack to top",

But the redemption of mankind from its \nself-imposed shackles of intellectual self-sufficiency, and idealistic or religious inheritance, \nis very different indeed, and the task, if ever attempted, is almost superhuman. \nThe institution of slavery in the Middle Ages was already bad enough.

Emancipation of mankind from such types of \nphysical and economic slavery is comparitively an easy affair. \nBut the most cruel and destructive form of slavery is an intellectual bigotry of possessing \nthe monopoly on truth, exclusive of others. It is such types of people, when they happen to \nwield temporal power on Earth, who hasten the downfall of a laboriously built civilisation, \nor the disintegration of a living religion. \nIntellect is, so to say, reserved by nature for man. One has to be a man to have intellect. But \nhowever keen and quick it may be, it will always be just one of the stepping stones to \nwisdom, inspiration, illumination, knowledge and Realisation of Truth, which is above all \nthese. \nTo keep playing on the stepping stone, however polished and shining it may be, is like \nsitting tight over an idle heap of hoarded wealth. \nLike everything else, intellect can be used as much as misused or abused. The deeper the \nintelligence, the greater the responsibility for discrimination between essentials and non-\nessentials, service and disservice, going forward or backward. \nMay you succeed in transcending the limitations of understanding, and crossing into the \ndomain of real knowledge, where nothing remains as unknown, unseen and unheard of; \nnay, everything becomes self-identified.

But the answers are not \naltogether honest and straight. The diagnosis given and the remedies adopted have all been \nbiased and one-sided. The whole situation stands hopelessly vague and undetermined. \nThe crux of the situation lies in the correct understanding and reinterpreting of the ancient \nword 'religion.' \nThe West has very little of religion, and whenever we hear of it, it is subservient to politics, \nor at best a handmaid of material life. The East is suffering from an overdose of religion, and \nconsequently it is desperately hankering for a material antidote thereto. Religion in the \nWest is synonymous with scientific progress, which is destructive in its  manifestation. In \nthe East, and particularly in India, religion, instead of establishing the kingdom of God on \nEarth, has gone underground in the guise of crude ceremonies, rude rituals, and dead \ndogmas. \nInstead of engendering the seeds of peace and plenty, the under-driven religion tries to \nshoot out communalism, fanaticism, nationalism and patriotism, which have become \nbywords for leadership and greatness, suffering and sanctity. In short, religion, as a living \nforce, has become obsolete. The urgent need of today, to rescuscitate religion, is to dig it out \nof its narrow and dark hidings and coverings, and let the spirit of man shine out once again \nin its pristine glory. \nThe most practical thing to do in the world is to be spiritually-minded. It needs no special \ntime, place or circumstances. It is not necessarily concerned with anything out of the way of \nanyone's daily life and day-to-day routine. It is never too late or too early to be spiritual. It is \njust a simple question of having a right attitude of mind toward lasting values, changing \ncircumstances, avoidable eventualities, and a sense of the inevitable. \nSpirituality is neither restricted to, nor can it be restricted by, anyone or anything, \nanywhere, at any time. It covers all life for all time. Yet it can very easily be achieved with \nselfless service and pure love that know no bondage and seek no boundaries. A mighty \nsurge of this spirituality is about to sweep over the world. My blessings to you all. \n3 April 1947, \nMadras, \nLM9 p3159 \nBack to top",

Then alone you will be safe. \n22 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p818 \nBeware of what will happen to you if you are proud. \n28 June 1928, Toka, to \nK.J. Dastur, LM3 p1064 \nEven a little salt spoils an entire pail of fresh milk. So also, the virtues of a man are nullified \nby a streak of pride in his character. \n29 June 1928, \nToka, \nto K.J. Dastur, \nLM3 p1064 \n... I have to see that these youngsters of today, who are the men of tomorrow, are taught \nmorals, and are fully roused to a sense of duty. Without morality, whatever they are taught - \neven if they are clever and pass first in their class - has no value. \nJune 1929, \nMeherabad, \nabout boys from Arangaon village, \nLM4 p1166 \nI must ask all aspirants to remember once and for all, that if they are desirous of rapid \nprogress and quick enlightenment, they should live up to the following four laws: \n1. If possible, observe celibacy. If already married, keep as little sexual intercourse with \nyour partner as possible. Consider, if you are a man, all other women as your sisters; if you \nare a woman, all other men as your brothers. \n2. Avoid all animal food, except milk and the products of milk. Don't partake of even eggs. \n3. Avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea is not an intoxicant, provided it is weak.  But \nbe moderate in your habit of tea drinking. \n4. Curb yourself, and never give way to anger. Whenever you fly into a passion, you contract \nred sanskaras, which are the worst of all. \nFebruary 1930, \nMs 2:2 p8 \nJames Douglas: Is there evil in the world? \nBaba: No, there is nothing like evil. \nDouglas: What do you mean? \nBaba: There is nothing except bliss everywhere. \nDouglas: How could that be? \nBaba: In reality, that is the case. \nDouglas: Then how would you explain the thousand and one evils in the world, such as theft, \nmurder, rape, treachery, dishonesty, immorality, torture? Can these wickednesses not be \nconsidered as evils? \nBaba: Not necessarily. \nDouglas: Then what do you call them? What are these to be considered? \nBaba: They are more or less of a degree of good itself. \nDouglas: Oh God, how wonderful. Why couldn't the poets and metaphysicians have \nexplained it in such a straightforward and intelligible manner? \nBaba: As I have said, there is nothing but bliss in the world. What the world calls evil is an \nextremely lower aspect of good. \nDouglas: Of course, of course. How easy. Why the people of the world cannot understand \nsuch a simple thing is surprising. Could you enlighten us as to when the world will \nunderstand this simple truth? \nBaba: When its angle of vision has changed. \nDouglas: But when? \nBaba: It is going on internally. \n9 April 1932, \nLondon, \ninterview with James Douglas, \nLM5 p1560-1561 \n... Courage is a great virtue, but it may, if misapplied, become a vice. So it is with love, the \nmainspring of our lives, which may lead to the heights of Realisation or to the depths of \ndespair. \nNo better example can be given of the two polarities of love and their effects than that of \nMary Magdalen before and after meeting Jesus. Between these two extremes are many \nkinds of love, all of which are good, but some of which are better than others. \nI use the terms 'good' and 'better' simply to designate the degree of liberation which they \nlead to or confer. Even the love which expresses through physical desire is good to the \nextent that it frees one from the thralldom of personal likes and dislikes, and makes one \nwant to serve the beloved above all other things... \nCreed, ritual, dogma, the conventional ideas of heaven and hell and sin are perversions of \nthe truth, and confuse and bewilder rather than clarifying and inspiring. \n1 June 1932, \nBeverly Hills, California, \nMe p99-100. \nAlso LM5 p1657-1658 \nRevenge follows hatred, and forgiveness follows love. Without love, none can cultivate the \nnoble habit of forgetting and forgiving. You forgive a wrong done to you in the same \nmeasure in which you love the wrongdoer. \nYou can counteract a disease only by its antidote. Love is the only antidote to hatred. When \nyou feel like hating a man, try to remind yourself that he is a form of your own self. \nThere is greater valour in conquering the heart of a single enemy than in gaining victory \nover the bodies of thousands of enemies. The mind is capable of turning the bitterest enemy \ninto the sweetest friend by constantly thinking well (charitably) of him. \nJealousy is not born of love, but of petty-mindedness, and dies simultaneously with the \ndeath of petty-mindedness. \nLove resembles death in that it annihilates snobbery, vulgarity, and all distinctions. \nUpon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God. Humility is spiritually of \ngreater worth than devotion. It is easier to be devout than to be humble, but devotion in \nmany instances proves to be a stepping-stone to humility. \nA man becomes wise by practising, not by preaching virtue. Ability in advising others about \nvirtue is no proof of saintliness, nor is it a mark of wisdom. \nIf a so-called religious leader comes forth and proclaims that marriages between brothers \nand sisters are quite lawful, he will immediately have a large following. But if a God-realised \npersonage proclaims that renunciation is indispensible to the attainment of Truth, only a \nfew will care to follow him. \nGod reveals himself only to that mind which is entirely devoid of egoism and egotism. \nWe cannot witness even the threshold of the divine Path until we have conquered greed, \nanger and lust. The worst sinners are better than hypocritical saints. \nThere is no obstacle which cannot eventually be overcome by the genuine spiritual aspirant. \nA lustful man, no matter what good qualities he may possess, cannot move along the \nspiritual Path. He is like a cart with one wheel. \nDo not get disheartened and alarmed when adversity, calamity or misfortunes pour in upon \nyou. Thank God, for he has thereby given you the opportunity of acquiring forbearance and \nfortitude. Those who have acquired the power of bearing with adversities can easily enter \nthe spiritual Path. \nBeware of pride, not only because it is hydra-headed, but because it is deceptive. So \ndeceptive is it that, more often than not, it puts on the apparel of humility. \nDo not try to find excuses or extenuating circumstances for your misdeeds. Unless you \nrepent of your wickedness, you cannot improve. To attempt to justify your misdeeds is to \nsmother your conscience and to make virtues out of vices. \nTake good care of your body, but do not be a slave to it. If you think constantly of its welfare, \nyou are like the miser who thinks constantly of his gold. \nVegetarian food and milk assist the development of the divine nature in man, whereas eggs, \nmeat, alcoholic drinks and fish tend to excite the animal nature in man. \nNever think that by helping another you have put him under any obligation to you. On the \ncontrary, believe that the recipient of your generosity gives you an opportunity to serve \nyourself. \nFrom the materialistic standpoint, it may seem cowardly to forsake the world, but it \nrequires great heroism to lead the spiritual life. \nMany young persons of today think that they are wise when they are only proud, and clever \nwhen they are only self-conscious. \nIt is the mind that makes us slaves to worldly desires. The mind also can enable us to \nbecome the masters of destiny and to realise the supreme self. \nThe chief props and agents of Maya are kama, krodh and lobh (lust, anger and greed). \nUnless and until you subjugate them, it is impossible for you to enter upon the Path that \nleads to union with God. \nIf worldly desires and anger take hold of your mind, then no matter how much you may \npractise tapa-yapa (austerity and asceticism) and meditation, you are still entangled in the \ntoils of Maya. Maya is the source of all worries, anxieties and troubles. \nDo not be angry with him who backbites you, but be pleased, for thereby he serves you by \ndiminishing the load of your sanskaras. Also pity him, because he increases his own load of \nsanskaras. \nIn order to enter upon the divine Path, it is necessary to purify the mind, to abstain entirely \nfrom carnal pleasures or sense enjoyments, and to love truth. He is a real aspirant who \nescapes the snares of Maya, speaks the truth, holds by the truth, and seeks truth only. \nTo be virtuous out of vanity is little better than to be vicious out of perversity. \nAs a tree is judged, not by the size, but by the quality of its fruits, so a man's worth should be \njudged, not by his talents, but by the use he makes of them. \nMere description of a medicine will not cure you of any disease, nor will mere hearing about \nsaints make you saintly. To be cured, you must take medicine, and to become saintly, you \nmust practise virtue. \nThe virtue that is the outcome of vanity is not real virtue. The valor that is prompted by \ndesperation is not real courage. \nHumanity should be considered the greatest test of civilisation. He who is devoid of \nhumanity should be considered a barbarian. Though a man may be very learned, very up to \ndate in the worldy routine of life, and advanced in scientific knowledge, yet if he lacks \nhumanity, he is still a barbarian. \nEven as copper is glossed by tamarind, so a wicked man can be polished by a true saint. But \neven as tamarind cannot make copper glossy without friction, so a saint can do nothing for a \nwicked man unless he comes into contact with him. \nDo nothing even to please me, or the world, against the dictates of your own conscience. \nUnhesitatingly do what you think to be right and proper, despite the opposition of the \nworld. Let your mind be firm as a rock that resists strong blasts of wind from all sides. \nNo matter what vicious qualities you may be possessed of, you should neither hesitate to \ncome, nor feel any shame in coming before me. I am for all. The wicked have as much right \nto approach me as the virtuous. Indeed, my main concern is to improve the vicious. \nbefore 1933, \nSa p8, 9, 11, 14-19, \n23, 25-28, 34-36, 40-41 \nEach paragraph is a separate quote \nIt is good for mankind, rather essential, to adhere to religious and moral principles and \nobserve religious bindings. But for the spiritual Path, they are unnecessary... \nAccording to the moral code of the world, one's word or promise is considered by mankind \nto be sacred. But he who has gone beyond time, space, cause and effect is not limited by \nanything... \nAll those who care for name and fame and worldly success, fearing criticism and scandal, \nare only ordinary human beings. They want to preserve their prestige at any cost. Their \n'name' alone matters to them, above money, life and everything else. \n10 October 1933, \nLondon, to Herbert Davy, \nLM5 p1820-1821 \nQ.  When a person is surrounded on all sides by untoward circumstances and difficulties, \nwithout any avenue of escape, would he or she be justified in doing something which would \nordinarily be termed undesirable or indecent? \nBaba: It is justifiable for a person in such circumstances to do anything, provided there is no \npersonal self-interest or pleasure involved. For example if, in order to pick up a silver coin \nfrom a pile of excrement, a person soils his hand and then washes it, he cannot be blamed \nfor doing so. He dirties his hand with a certain purpose in mind, and washes it after his \nobjective is achieved. It is no sin. \nHere is another example. Suppose a man is facing adverse circumstances on all sides. His \nfamily is starving, and one member is on his deathbed. The man has no wherewithal to \nprovide nourishment or medicine for his dying relative, and is quite helpless. In this case, if \nthe man has to resort to undesirable or even illicit means to save the life of another, without \nany thought for himself or his own happiness, he is justified in doing so. He is forced to do it \nto save the lives of others out of selfless motives. \nIn brief, this means that however wicked an action may seem to be, it should not be judged \non the basis of the world's standards of morality, but purely on the underlying motives. This \nis the spiritual point of view or standard of judgement, however shocking or absurd it may \nseem to the worldly-minded. \n11 October 1933, \nLondon, to a woman visitor, \nLM5 p1821-1822 \nQ. Is life a battle? \nBaba: Yes, it is a battle, and if rightly fought, would bring infinite anand (bliss). \nQ. Why should it be a battle? \nBaba: Necessarily, otherwise existence would be a drag. If there is no darkness, one cannot \nappreciate light. If there is no ignorance, one cannot appreciate knowledge. They can't exist \nwithout the other. Both are essential on the opposite poles. \nQ. Why is there so much evil in the world? \nBaba: It is as one takes it. In reality, there is nothing but God, good and bliss. But because of \nignorance, man doesn't see it, and takes the different degrees of expressions of good as evil. \nEven so, it is essential for the eradication of duality. Passing through different phases and \nexperiences of this duality, man evolves in consciousness and understanding of the one \nreality, which alone exists. \nQ. But what I mean to say is, there are certain periods or epochs when this evil is at its \nheight, and people who were eager to know Truth and were trying to find it do not \nunderstand why evil should spread throughout the world to such an alarming extent. \nBaba: These are the real periods which clearly show signs of the real burning point \napproaching... When evil predominates, it is a sure sign of the good that is coming. It must \nrise to its highest before it is eradicated and destroyed root and branch. The various signs of \nevil which are at present in vogue all over the world are preceding an era of good that is to \nimmediately follow. \nQ. Do you think it will lead to that? \nBaba: Sure. It will and must. It is a law - law of duality, good and evil, light and dark, \nknowledge and ignorance. Two forces working in opposites for the attainment of unity. And \nthere are always good souls who help humanity through their good thoughts, words and \nactions. \nQ. But they are few. \nBaba: Yes, but these few do a great deal in helping humanity through these good thoughts \nand acts. And at certain times leaders do appear for the salvation of humanity when the \nworld is in the phase of evil and degradation. Such a time is approaching, and the world will \nfind its leader that it now seeks. \n1930s? A p43-44 \nQ. If God is in everything, why is this evil prevalent in the world... this sort of disproportion? \nBaba: God is one, infinite, and as you now said, is in everything. But this good and evil, virtue \nand vice, suffering and happiness, are all apparent and not real. It is a delusion, and yet it is \nnecessary and serves its purpose. It is through this duality of good and evil that one has to \nrealise the oneness (infinity). This duality is the medium because, in reality, bad is not bad \nas you (the world) think. It is a degree of goodness. \nFor instance love and hatred, though opposite in terms, when carried to the extreme both \nhave the same result. You feel surprised, but I will explain. Suppose A loves me extremely. It \nmeans he thinks constantly of nothing else but me, and is perfectly lost in me. Now there is \nB, who hates me extremely. His extreme hatred makes him think of me always, though in \nthe other way, and is all the while absorbed in me and continually thinks of me. Thus love \nand hatred, though poles apart apparently, have the same result in their extremes. So good \nand evil are necessary to know what oneness (reality) is. \nA bird, free from its very birth and never caged, does not know what freedom really is, \nbecause it has always been free, that is, in the same condition from its very birth. If it is once \ncaged, that is, the condition reversed, and let free again later on, then alone will it know and \nappreciate the value and meaning of freedom. The cage therefore becomes the medium for \nthe bird to realise freedom. \nQ. Why all this misconception about duality in all things? \nBaba: It is not misconception, because in reality only one exists. What appears as two \n(duality) is delusion due to ignorance. Once this delusion about the apparent duality of all \nthings disappears, there remains nothing but one infinite existence. You are Perfect, but you \nare not yet conscious of it due to the darkness of ignorance. Yet this apparent ignorance is \nthe necessary process to get that consciousness of Perfection. Realise the one indivisible \nunity everywhere and in everything, and help others... Everyone is Christ, but very few can \nbecome Jesus. \n1930s? A p57-58 \nPoverty is no sin. \n1930s, London, A p59 \n... Always be honest in your dealings. It is better to be honest and to suffer, than to be \ndishonest and enjoy life. \n27 September 1934, \nMeherabad \nto Nadirshaw Irani, \nLM6 p19179 \nAs good is necessary, likewise bad is also necessary - just as positive and negative. Both are \nessential for action and evolution. \nIf only good were to prevail everywhere, life would end. \nBoth good or bad done to the extreme would lead to Self-realisation. For instance, absolute \nevil with no trace of good, or absolute good with no trace of bad at all - both are equally \nconducive to the attainment of the goal of Self-realisation. \nIf this is so, naturally it can be asked,'Why is good preferable to bad?' Both good and bad are \nzero, being non-existent for those who are God-realised. Both are terms of duality. But the \nMasters and Avatars give preference and advocate good over bad. This is only because good \nis really, spiritually speaking, easy for reaching the goal; though apparently, materially \nspeaking, it is the reverse. \nFor example, bad is apparently easy - difficult, really. But the underlying principle in life \nbeing spiritual progress - true existence - comes against the material progress which is only \napparent and not real. Thus the Masters advocate good, being truly easy for mankind, as the \nbetter course to follow for true progress in the march of life to the goal of Realisation. \nAnother reason for preferring and advocating good is that in evil, although apparently easy, \nwhile thinking about and actually committing a bad act, there is always a sort of torture to \nthe mind, which invariably happens after committing the act. For instance, illicit sex or \nmurder. \nWhereas in good, which though (is) apparently difficult, there is nothing of the kind - no \ntorture to the mind. On the contrary, there is a constant feeling of a sort of happiness, not \nonly in thinking but also in doing a good act, although it is always more difficult apparently \nto do good rather than bad. \nBesides, pursuing the course of doing bad to the extreme would not succeed or endure until \nthe end. A man's body, however bold, indifferent, healthy and robust, would not be able to \nwithstand prolonged indulgence in bad vices - such as lust, drinking liquor, or violence to \nthe extreme. \n27 April 1936, \nMysore, \nLM6 p2004 \nto his men Mandali \nTo be frank and fair is a quality and characteristic of persons who are honest, and have the \ncourage to openly say out what they feel, rather than to keep things in the heart, or say \nthings behind people's backs. Some take pride in that quality of being frightfully frank, and \nhate those who do not say out things as openly. \nYet there are times when one has to discriminate. Sometimes things spoken with the best of \nintentions totally spoil the case, if said when silence would serve the purpose for the time \nbeing. \nA person sensitive and of quick temperament would probably misunderstand words spoken \nwith the best of intentions, if said when he is not in a mood to listen. Such a person might fly \ninto a rage, become overexcited, and be prejudiced against the best of friends or well-\nwishers. He thereby loses the benefit of the advice and words of wisdom that would have \ndone him good if said in quieter moments when he would have understood their import and \neven appreciated it. Therefore it is not always the words and things, however frankly said, \nthat matter, but the right time and the way they are put. \nSilence, even though misunderstood for diplomacy or hypocrisy, would serve the purpose \nbetter ultimately than the best of the glorifying quality of being frightfully frank. Sometimes \nthe best of qualities which mankind glorifies are the worst of defects, if not used \ndiscriminately at the proper moment. \n11 March 1937, \nNasik? \nLM6 p2128 \nto his men Mandali \nThere is always a struggle between the spirit and the flesh, and the soul witnesses the \nstruggle. If the spirit succumbs to the flesh easily, without protesting, then there is no hope. \nIf the spirit gives in after struggling, there is hope. But if the spirit wins over the flesh, \nvictory is eternal. Yet it is the struggle itself that gives Perfection. So let us struggle now. \n10 May 1937, \nNasik, LM6 p2177 \nto his Western followers at Nasik \nAnything that forms itself into a habit loses its freshness, sincerity and enthusiasm - even \nrepentance. If you every day become weak, and repent for having been weak, in the end you \nfind your only weakness has been repenting. Only love remains ever fresh. \n10 May 1937, \nNasik, \nLM6 p2179 \nto his Western followers at Nasik \nQ. If after the best use of the intellect, a man comes to the conclusion that God does not exist, \nshould he not stick to his conclusion? \nBaba: As long as the conclusion does not lead you to moral evil, it does not matter. Such \nconclusion is an instance of the veiling of the truth by the operation of the intellect. When \nthe time is ripe, The truth is gradually unveiled. \nbefore November 1938, \nTr p199, \nalso MJ Nov. 1938 \nBeing good is a good binding. You must either be good or bad. Bad is like bound wrists. \nGood is like bound feet. Kabir writes beautifully about this: \"Good keeps your hands free, so \nthat you can even unbind your feet.\" \nBe good - it pays. Bad makes you mad. Good takes you to God. And the best way to become \ngood is to serve others and try to make others happy. \nThe climax of good is loving. Bad is anger, getting excited. Good is forgiving. Biting is bad, \nbut to be bit is good. If you offer your cheek, knowing you could easily wring their neck, that \nis excellent. \n26 January 1939, \nAgra, India, \nGl Feb. 1994, p6-7 \nRemember that the first step in spirituality is not to speak ill of others. All human beings \nhave weaknesses and faults. Yet they are all God in their being. Until they become Realised, \nthey have their imperfections. Therefore, before trying to find faults in others and speaking \nill of them, try to find your own weaknesses, and correct those. \n27 January 1940, \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2506 \nThe conditions that prevail in the world today are the cause of its suffering. But this misery \nand suffering are not for its emancipation. Only love can achieve that. The worst of sinners, \nafter undergoing untold privations, have turned into the greatest of saints. Even a sinner \nworse than Hitler can become a saint. If a man such as Hitler were really to feel what he has \ndone, and repent for it, then it would be greatness on his part. \nAll this is the play of the mind. The mind goes one way, and it keeps on going. Hitler thinks \nthat what he does is absolutely right, that he is doing justice for Germany. Mussolini thinks \nwhat he is now doing for Italy, compared to its former suffering, is quite good. With these \nthoughts, for their one right, they feel justified to commit millions of wrongs. \nThe more the gains now, the more the intoxication for still more. Drunkards, when they get \ndrunk, challenge, 'Come one, come all!' It's not the drunkards who say it, but their \nintoxication. Thus, out of sheer hostility, the more wrongs done, the more the repentance. \n7 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nLM7 p2579 \nIt is most difficult not to backbite. Still, the more you try, the more you help me. It is very \neasy to say that she is bad. but when one is bad, then to feel she is not bad is most difficult. \nTo take food once a day is easy, but to think well of others is real help. Even if just one of \nyou does it, I shall be happy. Criticism is in everyone's blood, and it is real self-control not to \nindulge in it. \nSuppose you are having three slices of bread and butter, and Nadia takes one slice and eats \nit. What would you say? You would think her mean. But if you offer her another slice \nsincerely, and say she is nice, that is something great and uplifting. \n15 July 1940, \nRanchi, \nLM7 p2589 \nto his women disciples, \nabout an order he gave them not to backbite for a year \nIf you do not get angry, you are a stone. If you get angry and cannot control it, you are an \nanimal. If you get angry and can control it, you are an angel, a saint. It is going against one's \nnature and habit that helps. Not getting angry will not help. You must not express it. \nImpotence is no help... \nYoga means control, which is more difficult than cutting off your arms and giving up your \neye. When Christ said give your other cheek to be slapped, it means control. But the world \nthinks that if you get slapped and don't get excited, you are either a coward or shameless. \nInnocent and fair criticism does not hurt, and is good, but it is quite rare. What I mean by \ntalking ill of others is when you criticise and it hurts. It hurts when you criticise excitedly, \nout of anger. When you criticise with love and kindness, how can it hurt? \nGautama Buddha gave twelve orders to his Circle members, the first of which was to guard \nagainst looking at a woman. He meant for none of his disciples to risk being enveloped in \nlust in the slightest, and to be saved by not even looking at any woman. He knew that this \nwould give rise to one weakness in his disciples - of always being nervous when in the \ncompany of women - but Buddha knew that this weakness was better than the risk. \nAny remark or criticism that does not hurt is good. Have fun, joke, humor, but do not hurt \nanyone and talk back. If you point out the shortcomings of others lovingly, without any \nfeelings of hate or animosity, it is all right. Even arguing with love is permitted. Try your \nutmost to help me, which you can do by acting according to my wish. Sacrifice your sweet \nhabit of hurting others. Fight to overcome lust, anger and greed. To control is not to do that \nwhich you have been used to doing. \nAs my work is based on my own supreme sacrifice, it will make your sacrifices for me by \nfollowing my order easy. If you fail once, do not give up, but try again. If you succeed once, \nyou wil have helped me a lot. If you fail nine times and win once, that too helps. \nIf a man feels hot, is feverish, is hungry or is ill, he gets excited and angry. If you have a \ntoothache, you are more apt to become excited about something than otherwise. Compared \nto a toothache, lust, anger and greed are most horrible diseases. Try to free yourselves from \nthem. There is no compromise in spirituality. Every desire is to be extirpated 100%. It is \neither yes or no. \n25 July 1940, \nMeherabad, \nto his women disciples, \nLM7 p2593-2594 \nThis war is a big drama. There is the hero, heroine, villain, all playing their parts in the \ndrama. \nIt is not Hitler's fault if he is playing the villain in God's drama. It's good he is acting his part \nwell. \nI like villains, heroes, angels, devils, anyone who acts their parts perfectly. \n25 July 1940, \nMeherabad, \nto his women disciples, \nLM7 p2594 \nOn July 25, 1940, at Meherabad, Meher Baba told his women Mandali: \nI will give you your orders tomorrow. I know you will follow all of them, except the one of \nnot criticising and speaking ill of others. That is one you won't be able to obey. \nI have been observing you all the past few days. I do not care if you do not obey, but if you \ndo you will help me. If you do not, you are of no help. The only hope -- which is only one \npercent -- is that from August first, you might try your best. \nEverybody fights, and as far as this order is concerned, all are hopeless. Try your best to \novercome it. Your fighting is all childish and has no sense. If you try, you will control, but \ntrying means thinking of me. \nI will be visiting once a week to see you for a few hours, and if later I go to a nearby \nmountain, still I will come once a week. The first hour of my visits I will spend with the \nEastern women in this house, so that Mehera will also be satisfied by seeing me. Then I will \ncall you all and talk with you for a few hours. Each will have a duty, and you must do it with \nall your heart. \nIf you do not get angry, you are a stone. If you get angry and cannot control it, you are an \nanimal. If you get angry and can control it, you are an angel, a saint. \nIt is going against one's nature and habit that helps. Not getting angry will not help. You \nmust not express it. Impotence is no help. \nIf you think of me, these orders will go easy for you. \nYoga means control, which is more difficult than cutting off your arms and giving up your \neye. \nWhen Christ said, 'Give your other cheek to be slapped,' it means control.

Try to free yourselves from \nthem. \nThere is no question of compromise in spirituality. Every desire is to be extirpated one \nhundred percent. It is either 'yes' or 'no.' \nMeher Baba, \n25 July 1940, \nMeherabad \nto his women disciples, \nLM7 p2593-2594 \nThe difference in good and bad is so subtle. Good for one person is bad for others. Hitler \nreally thinks he is doing good, but his good is bad for others. \n22 August 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2602 \nSomeone asked Hafez what spirituality meant, and he answered in one ode: \nUnless you go against your lower self \nyou cannot unite with your higher self. \nNow what is the lower self? That which makes you think you are small, that which makes \nyou feel that you are not satisfied, not happy, that which makes others see you as small. So \nthe meaning of going against the lower self is to transform this in quite the opposite \ndirection. Be that which makes you look big, and which makes others see you as big. Remain \npleased and contented, happy and satisfied. When you are displeased, unhappy or upset and \nmoody, it is your lower self asserting itself. \nPeople always put the blame for their dissatisfaction and suffering on others. But the fact is, \nwhen one suffers, it is one's own fault... \nIf you are firm, nothing will upset you. If you try, you will surely have it. I do not want any \nrepression, but I do want transformation. I never for one moment said that you must not get \nangry. Don't be confused. You must get angry when the occasion arises. But at once you \nmust get it out of your head. If you are not hungry, to fast has no meaning. \nI have told you this story before. Prophet Muhammad once told his chief apostle, Ali, 'If you \nwant to know me, try your utmost to control your anger and transform it into love. \nThe very next day someone challenged Ali to a fight. Ali fought him and won. He brought the \nman down and sat on his chest. \nThe man spat right in Ali's face (the worst insult to a Muslim), and Ali got so angry he raised \nhis dagger to kill him. But then Ali remembered what Muhammad had said, and so instead \nhe kissed him, and let him go. \nNow if he had not gotten angry, he would not have had the opportunity to control himself. \nThat does not mean that you should go on kissing each other when you are angry... \nNeither of the extremes is good - those who do not get excited, and those who very quickly \nlose their temper. But they are great who, though excited, control their temper... \nTo become excited and to express it is the easiest thing on earth. But to control anger is a \ngreat thing. \n5 September 1940, \nMeherabad \nLM7 p2606-2607 \nSanskaras must balance perfectly. This cannot be done by a mathematical process, or it \nwould be easy. Good and bad sanskaras are both bindings. If you have good sanskaras, you \nmay take birth as a great, rich man. With bad sanskaras, you may be born as a miserable \nleper, and so on. But you cannot get freedom without a Master. You do not know how many \nbad sanskaras you have, and how many good ones you need. But the Perfect Master knows, \nand he will work with you to balance them. \nOnce when Buddha was not yet unveiled, God-conscious - after he had renounced his \nkingdom, wife and child, and had gone into the forest, where he remained doing penance \nand fasting - he encountered an old woman who was advanced on the Path. She told him \nthat he was bound more than ever before. Before they were fetters of iron, now they were of \ngold, but both were binding all the same. Then she told him the secret. \nGood and bad are mere terms. Hitler sincerely thinks he is doing good, and the world thinks \nhe is doing bad. What is good for him is bad for the world. Good and bad are just man-made \nexpressions. Real freedom can only be obtained when you give up all desires. You have to \nrenounce them all to attain freedom... \nThere was a man who was a great murderer. In his life he murdered 99 people. One day he \nfelt very depressed and sick of it all. So he went to the Buddha and frankly and openly \nconfessed before him all his crimes, adding that he was feeling most dejected and wanted to \nend it all. The Buddha told him to go and sit by the side of a certain road and think of him. \nThe murderer did so. Years passed. \nOne day, while he was sitting there thinking of the Buddha, a rider came by, stopped before \nhim, and told him to move aside. The man refused, and the rider started lashing him with \nhis whip. Instantly reverting back to his old ways, the man pulled the rider from his horse \nand stabbed him. He killed him. However, at that very moment, the man realised God. \nThe rider was carrying on his person a message from one king to another ordering the \ndeath of one hundred spies. By saving the exact number of lives that he had murdered, his \ngood and bad sanskaras balanced. The man, of course, did not know all this, and was only \nthus saved by the Buddha because the Master knew. \nTherefore, if you obey implicitly and unquestioningly, you win, because, whereas your \nconception is limited, the Master knows all, and gives you just what is best for you. \n13 October 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2622-2623 \nGood actions lead to good results, and bad actions lead to bad results. \nIt is through the systematic connection between cause and effect in the world of values that \nthe moral order of the universe is sustained. If the law of karma were to be subject to any \nrelaxation, reversals or exceptions, and if it were not strictly applicable in the domain of \nvalues, there would be no moral order in the universe. And if there is no moral order in the \nuniverse, human existence would be precarious from the point of view of the attainment of \nvalues. \nIn the universe where there is no moral order, human endeavor would be perpetually \nfraught with doubt and uncertainty. There cannot be any serious pursuit of values if there is \nno assured connection between means and ends, and if the law of karma can be set aside. \nThe inflexibility of the law of karma is a condition of significant action. Significant human \naction would be utterly impossible if the law of karma could be safely ignored or flouted. \nIn being inviolable, the law of karma is like the other laws of nature. However, the \nrigorousness of the operation of karmic laws does not come to the soul as the \noppressiveness of some external and blind power, but as something which is involved in the \nrationality of the scheme of life. Karmic determination is the condition of true \nresponsibility. It means that man will reap as he sows. What a person gathers by way of his \nexperience is invariably connected with what he does. \nIf a person has done an evil turn to someone, he must receive the penalty for it, and \nwelcome the evil rebounding upon himself. And if he has done a good turn to someone, he \nmust also receive the reward for it, and enjoy the good rebounding upon himself. What he \ndoes for another he has also done for himself, although it may take time for him to realise \nthat this is exactly so. The law of karma might be said to be an expression of justice, or a \nreflection of the unity of life in the world of duality. \n1941? \nIndia, \nDi v4 p91-92 \nMan's conception of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable goes on evolving and \nchanging according to the nature of desires which happen to be dominant at any particular \nmoment. But as long as there is in his mind any kind of desire, he is impelled to appraise his \nexperience in relation to that desire, and divide it into two parts, the one contributing \ntowards its fulfillment, and therefore acceptable, and the other tending to prevent its \nfulfillment, and therefore unacceptable. Instead of meeting life and all that it brings without \nexpectation, entanglement or shirking, the mind creates a standard whereby it divides life \ninto opposites, one of which is regarded as acceptable, and the other as not acceptable. \nOf the opposites created by the human mind, the division between good and bad is \nspiritually most significant. It is based upon man's desire to be free from the limitation of all \ndesires. Those experiences and actions which increase the fetters of desire are bad. And \nthose experiences and desires which tend to emancipate the mind from the limiting desires \nare good. But since good experiences and actions also exist in relation to a desire, they also \nbind, just in the same way as bad experiences and actions. All binding can truly disappear \nonly when all desires disappear. And therefore true freedom comes when good and bad \nbalance each other, and get so merged in each other, that they leave no room for any choice \nby the limited self of desire... \nBut whether a person happens to be good or bad at any given time is dependent upon the \ninexorable operation of his sanskaras. From this point of view, the sinner and the saint are \nboth what they are according to the laws operative in the universe. They have both the \nsame beginning and the same end. The sinner need not have the stigma of eternal \ndegradation, and the saint need not have the pride for his moral attainments. \nNo one, howsoever saintly he may be, has attained the heights of moral virtues except after \na life of moral failings. And no one is so bad as not to be able to improve and become good. \nEveryone, however depraved he may be, can gradually become better and better, until he \nbecomes the best example for all mankind. \nThere is always hope for everyone. None is utterly lost, and none need despair. But it \nremains true that the way to divinity lies through the renunciation of the evil in favor of the \ngood. \n1942? Di v5 p28-30 \nThere is nothing such as good or evil. From a moral standpoint, this difference exists so that \nthe affairs of the world may be conducted according to limitations imposed by society. But \nfrom the spiritual standpoint, both are bindings. \nStandards of good and bad are established according to contemporary standards that may \nvary with time and circumstance. Also in spirituality, very often what is understood to be \ngood by the masses is, from the spiritual point of view, bad. And what is understood as bad \nby the masses is often good from the spiritual point of view. \nFor example, robbery is bad by general standards. But suppose there is an extremely \ndestitute pregnant woman. She has nothing to eat, and because of her condition, death is \ncertain. A man sees her, has pity on her, but he himself has no money and is unable to help. \nConsequently he steals money and uses it to feed the woman, but it is bad that he stole for \nthe purpose. Yet because of the bad act, he could also perform the good one. \nAlso, by general standards, beating others is bad. But if you beat someone with the motive of \ncorrecting his life, and do so without malice and without anger, this beating is a blessing to \nhim. The bad beating is then good. Three actions are bad: lust, anger and greed. And among \nthese, anger is the worst. \nMay or June 1942, \nIndia, \nLM8 p2798 \nTruth indeed is the best principle or rule of life. In practical life, however, while adhering to \nthis noble principle, adjustments are at times essential and justified, especially in cases \nwhere such adjustments contribute to the cause of benefit to others. \nFor example, suppose a person is wrongly convicted of a serious crime like murder. All \ncircumstantial evidence goes against him, and the wrongful conviction entails the death \npenalty. But someone turns up and says something that disproves the serious charge - for \nexample, saying that the accused was, at the time of the crime, actually seen elsewhere, or \nwith himself, or some place other than where the actual action took place. This statement \nmight save the life of a man wrongly accused and convicted to be hanged, and to that end, \neven if something untrue may have to be said, it is absolutely justified. In that case it is no \nfalsehood at all. \nA pious man of straight principles, allowing an innocent man to be thus hanged on \ncircumstantial evidence, when a few words from him might have saved his very life and \nproved his innocence, is under these circumstances worse than a man of no principles, or \neven a  considered vagabond who has the spontaneous spirit to come forward at such a \ncritical moment and give evidence, even false, that would save the life of an innocent man \nbeing sentenced to death. The former is a confused idea for mere idealists, who have neither \nthe spirit nor grit for real action when needed, and who cherish their ideals only for selfish \nends. Whereas one who has no principles, but has the spirit of action whenever needed, \neven to rush into fire for the sake of others, is worth a thousand idealists put together. What \nis the worth or use, however sublime, which does not inspire one to action for the benefit or \nservice of others? \n6 June 1943, \nAhmednagar, \nLM8 p2893 \nThere are always two aspects of divinity, perpetually and eternally active in the affairs of \nthe world. The destructive aspect of divinity as expressed in Persian means self-\nglorification, and the constructive aspect of divinity is called in Persian self-beautitude. The \naspect of self-glorification by God, when it gets palpably active, entails suffering and \ndestruction on a colossal scale, as we see it today. The aspect of divine self-beautitude, when \nit asserts itself, brings in its wake peace and plenty. \nIn the aspect of self-glorification, divinity repels itself through its own creation, and in the \naspect of self-beautitude, divinity attracts or loves itself through its own creation. The \nformer is a negative method, and the latter is a positive method, and both these methods \nultimately are instruments of divine wisdom to rouse humanity to their divine heritage, \nwhich is Self-realisation. \n3 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p71-72 \nStandards of good and bad are established according to contemporary standards that may \nvary with time and circumstance. In spirituality, very often what is understood to be good \nby the masses is, from the spiritual point of view, bad. And what is understood as bad by the \nmasses is often good from the spiritual point of view. For example, robbery is bad by \ngeneral standards, but if one robs to help some starving mother who has just given birth to \na child, it is good. Also, by general standards, beating others is bad. But if you beat someone \nwith the motive of correcting his life, and do so without malice and without anger, this \nbeating is a blessed virtue. \nFrom general standards of society, religion, health, morality and so forth, cleanliness of \nbody and mind are indispensible. It is, however, very easy to keep the body clean; but \ncleanliness of mind is very difficult indeed. The more one gets attached to bodily cleanliness \nfor merely selfish reasons, the less are the chances of having a clean mind. If, however, one \nis given up wholly to mental cleanliness, which means becoming free from low, selfish, \nimpure desires and thoughts of lust, greed, anger, backbiting, etc., the less is one's mind \nattached to bodily needs and bodily cleanliness. \nbefore 1948, Wa p33 \nDon't worry about anything... Faithfully discharge all your earthly duties. Always be honest \nin everything, and do not tell even little white lies, because God cannot live in a heart where \nthere is hypocrisy. \nDon't expect anything to be easy. Life will be full of problems, and the world even more so. \nIn fact, in years to come, the world will reach a zenith of anti-God thinking, immorality, lust \nand greed. because the ending of a vast cycle of cycles is taking place. But after the climax, a \nnew era of real brotherly love will be ushered in by God, who knows all that is going on. \nJanuary 1948, \nMeherazad \nto Ivy Duce, \nLM10 p3230 \nToni Roothbert: In this country, unfortunately, the youth are not taught about spirituality. A \nyouth does not even get ethical education. \nBaba: Yes, but be sure these very youths who know not of God, but know only to eat, drink, \nbe merry and do lustful actions, will soon get the shock of their lives, and know that only \nloving God is real life. \n16 May 1952, \nMyrtle Beach \nLM11 p3823 \nAnother version of the same quote \n(Note that this version attributes two lines to Baba that in the other version are spoken by \nToni Roothbert): \nIn this country at present, unfortunately, the youth is not taught spirituality. Youth is not \neven given ethical education. But be sure that these very youths who know not of God, but \nknow only to eat, drink, be merry and do lustful actions, will soon get the shock of their \nlives, and know that loving God is life, real life, the goal of life. \n16 May 1952, \nMyrtle Beach \nto Toni Roothbert, \nGG3 p42 \nWe have to be honest in our thoughts and deeds. God wants us to be absolutely honest. It is \nbetter not to believe in God than to pose as one who loves God. Only when we become \nhonest can we find God, even while attending to our duties, because then we feel detached. I \ngive you my love and blessings for the attainment of this honesty. \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nto members of the Defense Accounts Department, BG p5 \nEveryone is an atheist until he finds God by actual experience. It is better to be an atheist \nand be honest in words and deeds than to pose as a lover of God and lead a dishonest life. \nGod is independent. He needs no worship. He only needs that we be honest. \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nto an atheist, BG p6 \nBaba: Whatever you have to say today, tell me in five minutes. And whatever you say, speak \nhonestly. \nHarish Chander Kochar: Free me of my mental anxieties, and permit me to stay with you, as \nthe world is a fraud, and I do not wish to live in it. People ridicule me for my simplicity, and I \nwill die one day because of it. Permit me to be present here daily when you are discoursing \nto the Mandali. \nBaba: Those invited to the discourses will be stopped from tomorrow. My lovers who were \ncoming for work will also be prevented from coming. \nYou do not know about God and the Path. If people act dishonestly with us, if people create \ndifficulties for us, if people deceive us, and yet we remain honest, we are very fortunate; \nbecause these deceivers, our so-called enemies. are our friends. They wash off our \nweaknesses, our sins, and make our path clear toward God. They do not deceive us, but they \nhelp us and deceive themselves. \nFirst, remain honest at all costs, and under any circumstances. \nSecond, in business disputes, take all necessary legal steps as advised, and try your best, but \nnot with a feeling of bitterness. I will help you internally. \nThird: love me more and more. \n(Kochar asked for strength to follow these instructions.) \nBaba replied, 'Whenever I give instructions to anyone, I also at the same time give him the \nstrength to carry them out.' \n23 March 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nto Harish Chander Kochar, \nLM 12 p4101-4102 \nAnother version: \nYou don't know God and the Path. If people act dishonestly with us, if people create \ndifficulties for us, if people deceive us, and yet we remain honest, we are very fortunate; \nbecause these deceivers or our so-called enemies are our friends. They wash away our sins \nand weaknesses and make our path clear toward God. They do not deceive us; they help us \nand deceive themselves. \nBG p7 \nModesty is weakness. Humility is strength. A world of difference, therefore, exists between \nthe two. The moment you say, 'Baba, it is not my ego,' 'I say in all humility,' this very \nexpression is ego. Even if in your mind you feel that 'I am humble,' this feeling is egotistic. \nNow, what is the difficulty? If, in true honesty, you want to express true humility, then some \nobstacle at once appears. It may be the thought of what others would think about you. Even \nif, with all your honesty, you express humility, such a thought may come. \nIn modesty, you are constantly pestered with thoughts of your correct behavior, to such an \nextent that an inferiority complex is created in you, which is not strength but weakness. \nNo sooner is humility given an expression, it is no longer humility. It is humbug to give \nexpression to humility. A life of humility is to be lived spontaneously, which should not give \nrise to any thought, either of modesty or humility. \nFor example, think of cleaning a latrine. And when you actually clean it, you begin to get the \nstink of the filth. Whereas a regular scavenger, whose life is to clean latrines, is immune to \nthe stink. \nSimilarly, a person who expresses humility is like the person who feels the stink when \ncleaning a latrine. Whereas the person who lives the life of humility is like that scavenger, \nwho is not only immune to the stink, but is absolutely unmindful of the public opinion or \nreaction to what he does, because he lives the life of a scavenger. \nTo try to be humble is also humbug. You must be so natural that your life be humility \npersonified, which is then strength. Only God and Perfect Masters can live such a life. They \nare the only ones who are really humble. \nSo what you are, you are to express unmindful of public opinion or reaction. Be natural. If \nyou are dishonest, don't hide yourself behind the curtain of honesty. That, however, does \nnot mean that you should be dishonest. What I want to say is that you must be most natural, \nrather than hypocrite. \n25 February 1954, \nAndhra, India, \nAD p66 \nWe are all, in a way, hypocrites, inasmuch as we always try to justify ourselves, right or \nwrong. \nAccording to the Vedantists and the Sufis, God does everything. Everything is done \naccording to his will and in accordance with his laws. In a way, that is all right.  But, being \nshort of the truth, the whole of it is not right. And the lack of truth is the lack of experience \nbehind the assertions. \nWithout having gained the actual experience, to act according to facts of experience is not \nonly silly -- like a tutored parrot expressing love to a girl -- but such assertions, based on \nmere reasoning and logic, lead to lust and dust. The reactions of the actions based on such \n'ignorance of knowledge' are too terrible to contemplate, apart from other consequences \nlike lunacy or nervous breakdown. \nBhakti marg (the path of devotion), which is the sum and substance of every religion, makes \nus frigidly rigid over 'right is right' and 'wrong is wrong,' leading to a dry-as-dust, brittle \nand boring attitude of the mind. \nUnder yoga practices the experiencing of different kinds of temporary samadhis brings \nforgetfulness of Reality and causes the yogi to lose sight of the goal itself. By jap-tap and \nchilla-kashi he is entrapped in novel but nonetheless limited powers that eventually prove a \nboomerang for his mind. \n1950s? Aw 10:4 p 4-5 \nAlso PL p35-36 \nWhat is good and what is bad? There was a thief who used to steal, and therefore he was \npointed out as being bad. One day the thief went to a house to rob it, but there he found a \nwoman in great pain, just about to give birth to a child. She was all alone, so instead of \nrobbing her house, the thief helped her to deliver the baby, and made her comfortable. Then \nhe went out to steal food and clothing for the woman. He stayed with her until he knew that \nshe was all right. He then went on his way, and continued to steal from others. \nWell now, what do you think of this man? Is he bad or is he good? You could call him bad \nbecause he is a thief, but then he did a good turn, and you could call him good. So there is \nnothing like good or bad. But there are things I don't like... lust, greed and anger, and anger \nis the worst... \nBetween 1946 and 1958, \nBombay, \nGO p234-235 \nStrength begets humility, whereas modesty bespeaks weakness. Only he who is truly great \ncan be really humble. When, in the firm knowledge of it, a man admits his true greatness, it \nis, in itself, an expression of humility. He accepts his greatness as most natural, and is \nexpressing merely what he is, just as a man would not hesitate to admit to himself and \nothers the fact of his being man. \nFor a truly great man, who knows himself to be truly great, to deny his greatness would be \nto belittle what he indubitably is. For whereas modesty is the basis of guise, true greatness \nis free from camouflage. On the other hand, when a man expresses a greatness he knows or \nfeels he does not possess, he is the greatest hypocrite. \nHonest is the man who is not great, and knowing and feeling this, firmly and frankly states \nthat he is not great. There are more than a few who are not great, yet assume a humility in \nthe genuine belief in their own worth. Through words and actions they express repeatedly \ntheir humbleness, professing to be servants of humanity. \nTrue humility is not acquired by merely donning a garb of humility. True humility \nspontaneously and continually emanates from the strength of the truly great. Voicing one's \nhumbleness does not make one humble. For all that a parrot may utter, 'I am a man,' it does \nnot make it so. Better the absence of greatness than the establishing of a false greatness by \nassumed humility. Not only do these efforts at humility on man's part not express strength, \nthey are, on the contrary, expressions of modesty born of weakness, which springs from a \nlack of knowledge of the truth of reality. \nBeware of modesty. Modesty, under the cloak of humility, invariably leads one into the \nclutches of self-deception. Modesty breeds egoism, and man eventually succumbs to pride \nthrough assumed humility. The greatest greatness and the greatest humility go hand in \nhand, naturally and without effort... \nLive not in ignorance. Do not waste your precious lifespan in differentiating and judging \nyour fellow men, but learn to long for the love of God. Even in the midst of your worldly \nactivities, live only to find and realise your true identity with your beloved God. \nBe pure and simple, and love all because all are one. Live a sincere life. Be natural, and be \nhonest with yourself. Honesty will guard you against false modesty, and will give you the \nstrength of true humility. \nSpare no pains to help others. Seek no other reward than the gift of divine love. Yearn for \nthis gift sincerely and intensely, and I promise in the name of my divine honesty, that I will \ngive you much more than you yearn for. \nI give you all my blessing that the spark of my divine love may implant in your hearts the \ndeep longing for the love of God. \n12 September 1954, \nAhmednagar \nGl Feb. 1994, p4-5 \nWith me, none can live what the world considers a moral life. Here we are concerned with \nspirituality, not morals. A spiritual life is not ruled nor bound by any principles. The \nsanskaras of each one are different, and so the behavior and temperament of everyone are \ndifferent. \nIn a virtuous life, evil is supressed and good surfaces, but the evil is still there. The bad \nsanskaras remain and have to be worked out, if not in this life, then in the next, or the one \nafter. \nIn the spiritual life, both good and bad sanskaras express themselves, and both get nullified. \nA spiritual life leads one toward naturalness, whereas a virtuous life, in the guise of \nhumility, inflates the ego and perpetuates it. \nA spiritual life, though, is only led under the guidance and orders of the Avatar or Perfect \nMaster, who knows the pulse of everyone, and treats everyone according to his own \nparticular malady... \nPeople of the world act according to moral standards and socially acceptable behavior. But \nthe Avatar or Sadguru deals with everyone according to his or her sanskaras. Thus spiritual \nlife is totally different, and cannot be judged on the basis of morality, ethics, or any \nprinciple. \n1955, \nMeherabad, \nunpublished \nQ. Have you heard of an American evangelist by the name of Billy Graham? Have you met \nand spoken with him? \nBaba: No. \nQ. Have you heard of his work? \nBaba: I know. \nQ. Can you tell us what you think of his work? \nBaba: Any work done in the name of God or Lord Jesus is a good work. But it must be done \nsincerely, honestly, without taking any pride in it, without wanting to profit through it. \n23 July 1956, \nNew York, \nin answer to a reporter's \nquestions at a press conference, \nAw 4:3 p18 \nGood as well as evil are impressional products of the evolutionary momentum. They come \ninto conflict with each other, and as such are to be recognised as separate groups of forces. \nSatan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, each in his own way symbolises the forces of evil. However, it is a \nmistake to think that evil is an irreducible active force by itself. Both good and evil are \nabstractions, and have to be seen in their true perspective as inevitable phases in the \nsubhuman and human evolution. \nEvil is the lingering relic of earlier good. Some impressional tendencies, which were \nnecessary and inevitable at a particular phase, are carried over to the higher phase of \nevolution, and they persist in their existence due to inertia. They hinder harmonious \nfunctioning in the new context, and appear as evil. \nGood as well as evil have an undeniable relationship with the circumstances. No judgement \ncan be passed on the goodness or other aspect of any action without considering the \nconcrete context in which the judgement is called for. An act which is normally undeniably \nevil may, under special circumstances, be not only defensible but praiseworthy. \nTake for example the following exceptional case. Suppose a mother has given birth to a baby \nand has not her own milk to feed it. The baby has to be fed on cow's milk, which is very \ndifficult to obtain. A neighbor may have some cow's milk, but the mother knows that he will \nnot part with it for money or for any philanthropic consideration, even though he does not \nneed it himself. Under such circumstances, if a person steals the cow's milk and feeds it to \nthe newborn baby in order to keep it alive, the act of stealing is in this case not only \njustifiable but definitely good. \nOf course an exception of this type does not make stealing a good act under all \ncircumstances. Normally stealing continues to be evil, but in the exceptional case above it \nhas become good. The illustration proves how considerations of good or evil must, in their \nvery nature, be dependent upon circumstances in all the variety of detail which obtains in \nconcrete situations. Good is relative to a concrete context of actual circumstances, and so is \nevil. But for many practical purposes certain trends of action have to be classified as good, \nwhile other trends of action have to be classified as evil. \nEverything happens according to divine will, and it is a mistake to think that God has a rival \nin the form of a devil. Accentuation of the forces for good is necessary for releasing divine \nlife in its fulness. But evil itself often plays an important part in accentuating the forces for \ngood, and it becomes an inevitable shadow or counterpart of the good. Like other opposites \nof experience, good and evil are also, in a sense, opposites which have to be withstood and \ntranscended. One has to rise above the duality of good and evil, and accept life in its totality, \nin which they appear as abstractions. Life is to be seen and lived in its indivisible integrity. \nNevertheless, there is an important factor in the opposites of good and evil. Evil is to all \nappearance the converse of good, yet at the same time it is capable of being converted into \ngood. Thus, generally speaking, the path lies from evil to good, and then from good to God, \nwho is beyond both good and evil. \nIf any suffering comes to a Perfect Master or Avatar, it should not be interpreted as a \ntemporary victory of evil. It happens by divine will, and is a form of divine compassion. He \nvoluntarily takes upon himself the suffering of others in order to redeem those who are \nengulfed in gnawing cravings, unrelieved hatred and unabated jealousies. \n1956? Be p55-58 \nSpiritual unfoldment takes place through experience of such opposites as pleasure and pain, \nsuccess and failure, virtue and vice. Both extremes are equally necessary for the fulfillment \nof life, although they appear to be direct opposites of each other. \nIn fact, from a larger point of view, the opposites of experience turn out to be \ncomplementaries rather than contraries. They appear to be clashing incompatibles only for \nthe mind that cannot transcend them. They are like diametrically opposite points on the \ncircumference of a circle. If you pursue any point on the circumference, the path through it \nwill necessarily lead to its diametrically opposite point. And the path from this opposite \npoint again returns to the starting point. Movement between the opposites is as endless as \nmovement in a circle... \nIf an action does not have the wholehearted support of the innermost being of a person, it is \nquick in inviting its opposite. If, however, an action has had the wholehearted support of the \ninnermost being, it can evade deflection as long as it does not gather in its train some other \nthings which strike a note of discord within the innermost being. The way to transcend the \nalternation between fractional opposites is to steer one's own life so as to make it a true and \ncomplete expression of the innermost being. \nNevertheless, until the entire accumulated self of a person comes into complete harmony \nwith the one divine self within, the law of opposites inevitably comes to his help, whether he \nconsciously wants it or not... \nThe law of opposites does not function through arithmetical or mechanical calculus, but \nthrough the requirements of karmic adjustments, and a supreme need for full and free \nunfoldment of life in every form. Alternation between the palatable and unpalatable \nopposites is a game of see-saw which must continue until arrival at a dynamic poise, which \nis beyond the opposites, and which is the unhampered expression of the unalloyed eternal. \n1956? Be p58-67 \nBe angry with none but your weakness. Hate none but your lustful self. Be greedy to own \nmore and more wealth of tolerance and justice. Let your temptation be to tempt me with \nyour love in order to receive my grace. Wage war against your desires, and Godhood will be \nyour victory. \n1958? \npamphlet 'Sayings by Meher Baba, 1958 \nStart learning to love God by beginning to love those whom you cannot. You will find that in \nserving others, you are serving yourself. The more you remember others with kindness and \ngenerosity, the less you remember yourself. And the less you remember yourself, the more \nyou forget yourself. And when you completely forget yourself, you find me as the source of \nall love. \nGive up parrotry in all its aspects. Start practising whatever you truly feel to be true and \njustly to be just. Do not make a show of your faith and beliefs. You have not to give up your \nreligion, but to give up clinging to the outer husk of mere ritual and ceremonies. To get to \nthe fundamental core of truth underlying all religions, reach beyond religion... \nInstead of making truth the vital breath of life, man compromises by making over and over \nagain a mechanical religion of it - a handy staff to lean on in times of adversity, a soothing \nbalm for his conscience, or as a tradition to be followed in the footsteps of the past. \nMan's inability to live God's words makes them a mockery. How many Christians follow \nChrist's teaching to 'turn the other cheek,' or 'to love thy neighbor as thyself'? How many \nMuslims follow Muhammad's precept to 'hold God above everything else'? How many \nHindus 'bear the torch of righteousness at all cost'? How many Buddhists live the 'life of \npure compassion' expounded by Buddha? How many Zoroastrians 'think truly, speak truly, \nact truly'? \nGod's truth cannot be ignored; and thus by mankind's ignorance and weakness a \ntremendous adverse reaction is produced - and the world finds itself in a cauldron of \nsuffering through wars, hate, conflicting ideologies, and natures's rebellion in the form of \nfloods, famines, earthquakes and other disasters. Ultimately, when the apex is reached, God \nmanifests anew in human form to guide mankind to the destruction of its self-created evil, \nthat it may be re-established in the divine truth... \n10 July 1958, Meherabad \nfrom a pamphlet entitled: \n\"Meher Baba's Universal Message, \nGod Alone Is, Personal Message\" p5-7 \nAnother version: EN p72-75 \nLove and understanding never condemn, but seek to help and encourage.

All can meet Baba.\" \nWith tears in her eyes, the woman said, \"But I am a sinner. How can I touch a holy being like \nhim? \nBaba went to her and passed his hand over her head and shoulders. She started weeping. \nBaba told her, \n\"I am the purest of the pure. I can purify the worst sinner. You have understood your \nmistakes and acknowledged them faithfully in the presence of others, and so you are \nforgiven. This penance from the depths of your heart is adequate, and you are now cleansed. \nNow don't fear in the least, and don't repeat your past mistakes. I give you my blessings.\" \nBaba embraced her. Later, when he was about to leave, Baba put his hand on the woman's \nhead and told her, \n\"You have received forgiveness for everything. Forget the past and don't worry at all.\" She \npressed her eyes to Baba's hand and kissed it. \n(LM5 p1659) \nHerbert Davy: You promise to speak, but you do not do it. What will the world think of you? \nBaba: \"It is good for mankind, rather essential, to adhere to religious and moral principles \nand observe religious bindings. But for the spiritual Path, they are unnecessary. I am beyond \nall principles, bindings, laws and matters pertaining to worldly duties. I am Perfect, and \nthere is no restraint or binding for me. I have broken all barriers, and I have gone beyond all \nlaws. \n\"According to the moral code of the world, one's word or promise is considered by mankind \nto be sacred. But he who has gone beyond time, space, cause and effect is not limited by \nanything. For him there is no such thing as bondage. The infinite cannot be bound by \nanything finite, however sublime the aim may be. This means that one cannot limit the \nlimitless. \n\"For this reason, and without your asking, I give you promises, and your aim will be fulfilled \nat the proper time. But I also know that a promise can be a time-serving device. It is not \nmeant for fulfillment, but necessitated by circumstances. It is a demand of the situation, and \nso I do not care for its resultant reaction. \n\"Therefore I do not worry about the world's criticism, or its terrible slander and harm to my \nwork for not keeping my promise. I purposely create and court such opposing reactions and \nnurture them. Such an opposition is required for my work, to give it a greater punch. I am \nbeyond praise and slander, and they do not affect me in the least. \n\"All those who care for name and fame and worldly success, fearing criticism and scandal, \nare only ordinary human beings. They want to preserve their prestige at any cost. Their \n'name' alone matters to them, above money, life and everything else. \n\"I am the Truth. No amount of voluminous praise will raise me higher, nor can any carping \ncriticism pull me down. I am what I am, and will ever be so. Whatever I do, I do for my work, \nwhich encompasses and sees to the welfare of all.\" \n10 October 1933,  London, to Herbert Davy, LM5 p1820-1821 \nMeher Baba gave his women disciples a list of orders they were to follow till August 1941. \nHe asked them each to sign a written promise to obey them. Then he said (using the \nalphabet board): \n\"I am certain all the outside devotees will follow the orders, but I have not the slightest hope \nof you all - my inner circle. For the next twenty days, you must keep your mood at its best. \nUnder any circumstances and conditions, you are not to get excited, not to have moods, but \nalways to be happy and smiling. This is the greatest help to me. \n\"People join the war, fight, get wounded, and suffer untold hardships - but that is easy in \ncomparison. To keep your best mood in every situation, never to be upset or sad, to speak \ngently and lovingly, never using a harsh word, not to get excited when someone steals your \nchapati, but to say from the bottom of your heart, 'May Baba bless you,' - that is really \ndifficult. \n\"To control the self is more difficult than walking on fire or glass. It is easy to win a war of \nnations, but most difficult to win your own self. It is the only real thing on this path. To keep \na calm head, tolerate and swallow everything. The Sufis call it zabta. \n\"My mother helps me the most now. She gives ample opportunities to me and to others to \ncontrol themselves. You have won the greatest war when you win yourself. When \nShireenmai comes, you will have more opportunities of controlling yourselves. For example, \nI feel like murdering her sometimes, yet I embrace her lovingly. You should do the same.\" \n26 January 1941, Jaipur, LM7 p2657 \nTurekar came to Meherabad to see Meher Baba in March, 1948. He worked as police sub-\ninspector, and had been to visit Baba many times. Baba asked him, 'Do you take bribes?' \nTurekar answered, 'Yes, Baba.' \nBaba told him, 'You have been in my contact for so many years, and still you accept bribes? \nSuch corruption is not at all good. Give it up completely.' \nTurekar promised to stop taking bribes. \n9 March 1948, Meherabad, LM9 p3255-3256 \n\"I witnessed a man who came before Baba in  Myrtle Beach in 1952. Ivy Duce brought this \nman. He was giving a lot of talks on spirituality. He was very respected all over Europe, a \nvery important man. \n\"I was the interpreter, and was dumbfounded when Baba asked him the following question. \nI thought he would ask him a question about his work, about his understanding of the \nAvatar, or something else, but Baba asked him directly, 'Are you involved with a woman?' \n\"He was a very truthful and honest man. He said, 'Yes, Baba, I am.' \n\"Then Baba said, 'Then what is the good of your talking about spirituality? Will you do one \nthing?' \n\"He replied, 'Yes, I shall try. I don't promise.' \n\"'All right,' Baba said. 'Give up this business of bangles.' (Bangles signified woman or women \nin Baba's gestures.) \n\"'I will try,' the man said. \n\"That was in 1952. Baba went again in 1956. This man came also and saw him again. Baba \nagain asked him about this, and he replied, 'I am still very much in the world.' \n\"Baba said, 'What is the good of your giving talks? Give up this hypocrisy.'\" \nAdi K. Irani, JT p137 \n(Adi told this story during a public talk, so Baba's words are approximate, as Adi \nremembered them) \n\"Our hosts would completely turn their homes over to Baba for his disposal. You had the \nfeeling that at a word from Baba, these new lovers of his would have jumped into a fire for \nhim... Where we were staying there was a berry tree... And it was that season, November, \nwhen the tree was full of berries. Not only was the tree full, but the ground was also covered \nwith the berries, because they were so ripe they were falling off the tree. Now Gustadji was \nwith us, and he happened to be walking by, and he picked up a berry from the ground and \nate it, and this was followed suit by the other Mandali who were with him... Baba came to \nknow of this. And Baba was not pleased, in fact he was very upset. \n'What are you all doing,' Baba demanded. \n'Baba,' the Mandali replied, 'we were just eating some berries that had fallen.' \n'Did you have permission to eat these berries?' \n'But Baba, they had fallen to the ground, and we were just picking them up.' \n'You should have asked first,' Baba insisted. 'Who owns this tree?' \n\"It turned out to be our host, so Baba said to call him. And Baba had all of the Mandali and \nour host and his family come into the room with him, and it was obvious from one glance \nthat Baba had not called everyone together for some sweet words on love. On the contrary, \nBaba was fiery. And he began to upbraid Gustadji for stealing the berries. When the host \nheard this, he got very upset, and tried to pacify Baba. \n'Baba,' he said, 'I am yours. This house is yours, and even the berry tree is yours. The \nMandali are also yours. So the berries they ate belong to you, not to me.' \n\"... Baba continued, 'Yes, the whole creation is mine. And yet the world's laws must be \nfollowed. It is not right in the world to take something that does not belong to you without \nthe permission of the owner. This is true in the world. And it applies even more so with \nthose who are living with me. They should not think they are above such laws.' \n\"... He stood and joined his hands together, and on behalf of his Mandali, Baba asked the \nhost's forgiveness.\" \nEruch Jessawala, TH p6-8 (1950s, Hamipur) \n\"For long periods Meher Baba did not permit anyone longing to meet him to come to \nMeherazad where he lived. We always pleaded with Baba to allow his lovers this \npermission, but the result would always be the same. They would be called only when Baba \nwanted them to come, and I could never understand this. \n\"One day, however, Baba permitted a certain man to visit him. This person expressed \nexcessive devotion to Baba, and pretty much enacted a show in Baba's presence. In my \nheart I could see through the entire act, since I knew that the man was an absolute \nscoundrel, but I did not mention anything to Baba. The man came on several occasions after \nthat, and each time he effusively put on an act of love and devotion, which to the onlookers \nsmacked of play-acting. Finally, when I could not take it any more, and the visitor had left, I \ntold Baba that the man was a thorough scoundrel, and that he was merely putting on an act \nof love and devotion. Baba simply said, \n\"'Yes, I know he does. You are looking at only his shadow, but I see his substance. He may be \na scoundrel, but he has the potential to be a real lover of God. You see him as bad, but you \ndon't know how far he had to come to be only this bad.'\" \nEruch Jessawala, AO p132 (after 1948?) \n\"I saw a man come to Meher Baba, the worst scoundrel, and Meher Baba said, 'You are a \nvery nice man. But try to be better and best.' \n\"What would that man gain if Baba said that he was a bad man, and so forth?\" \nAdi K.

    "text": "MUSIC AND SOUND \nMeher Baba \nThere are 132 tunes in music. The singing by an expert musician or maestro is wonderful. \nBut they are very rare. There was a blind singer in  Delhi who is now dead whose \nperformance was quite superb. \nGod is infinite naad. Kabir calls it anhad naad or infinite voice. In each Subtle and Mental \nplane there are seven tunes. Thus there are 43 tunes, 42 in the six planes, and one of God's \ntune. Even the best and most exquisite true voice of the Gross plane is only the seventh \nshadow of that voice which is God's, and which Christ, Zarathustra and Kabir have called the \nword of God. The voice of the best singer, which makes the rain fall, lights play and people \nweep, is only the seventh shadow of that voice which is God's. \nIf the tune of the sixth shadow is heard, it will make one completely forget the universe. This \nhappens on the first plane. If the pilgrim keeps listening to that note, which is continuous on \nthe first plane, he cannot go on. On the second plane, when the pilgrim hears the fifth \nshadow of that eternal voice, he neither eats nor sleeps. The second plane is far more \npowerful than the first. It is called naad, which means tune. \nDo not take the examples cited literally. How can it be explained? The Hindus call the word \nof God Om. If you close your mouth, you cannot say anything, but you can utter omm... \nmmm... mmm, the seventh shadow of the voice of God. God is infinite voice, infinite light and \ninfinite love. \nOn the first plane, they hear with the Subtle ear; on the fourth and  fifth planes, with the \nMental ear; and on the seventh plane, they become the voice itself. How can you grasp it? \nImpossible. How can you understand God as voice and your becoming that voice? \nWhat is love? Even if you love, it is very difficult to define that love. Then just imagine how \nimpossible it is to define infinite love. The Vedant says that the sun and the fiery planets are \nmerely the seventh shadow of that light which is God. A shadow itself is nothing. Therefore \nthe seventh shadow of that shadow means not even nothing. \nGod's voice is not what we use when we speak. Imagine God as this voice. They call it voice \nmerely to try to explain it. Vedantists cannot explain it. \nSufis explain it differently - not as a shadow, but as a veil. They describe it like this: say that \nyou are God. You look into a mirror. What you first see in the mirror is the sixth plane - the \nfirst reflection. Then you see the reflection behind a veil in the mirror, and that is on the \nfifth plane - the second reflection. The reflection behind another veil, behind the first veil, is \non the fourth plane - the third reflection. And so on, veil after veil, until the seventh. These \nare the seven veils. \nTake another example. Let's say consciousness is God. You, Elizabeth, are conscious of \nholding Kippy in your lap. Then you imagine you have a tiger in your lap. This imagination is \nthe first shadow of this consciousness. Then comes the shadow of this shadow, the sixth \nplane, and so on. \nAnother example: In India, they make bells by hand, not by machinery. First they mold a bell \nof earth, then pour melted metal on top and make a metal bell. After the process is over, \nthey remove the earthen bell. Now, this earthen bell is the first shadow of the real bell. \nAlthough it is the exact replica of the real bell, it is only earth, and cannot ring. Therefore, if \nthe difference between the bell and its first shadow (earthen bell) is so vast, what must the \nseventh shadow be? Just nothing. If in the first shadow there is no metal, but earth, what \nwould they find in the seventh shadow? \nI explain this more clearly than anyone in the world. Still I cannot explain clearly enough in \nwords. \nOnce a man who never had a headache went to a hakim (doctor) and asked him, 'What is a \nheadache?' The hakim knew what it was, for he had experienced it. He explained for hours \nin words and actions, but the man could not imagine what a headache could be like. At last, \nin exasperation, the hakim picked up a stone and struck the man squarely on the head. The \nman knew at once what a headache was, and with his question answered in this realistic \nmanner, he left. \nAbout the shadows, I can give you the experience in a second, but cannot explain it to you in \nwords. I said this world is the seventh shadow of God. If God does not exist, the world would \nnot exist. But the voice of God is not sound. Even on the third plane, there is no sound. On \nthe first plane is Subtle sound, very very faint. In the second plane, the sound is more \ndrowning, and you get drowned in it. But that voice which is God, the shadow of that voice, \nis overpowering in the third plane. Sufis call it 'dumbfounding.' \nNadine Tolstoy: Does the shadow of the voice of God gradually get fainter in every plane? \nBaba: You cannot say that God is infinite and gets more and more finite on every plane. \nInfinite cannot be finite. If you say God's voice becomes weaker, it is not right. God's voice \ncannot become weaker. \nIt is like the example of the bells. Let us say the first bell is of gold, and that its first shadow \nis an iron bell. The second shadow is an earthen bell. The third shadow is a paper bell, and \nso forth. All have the same shape, but the gold bell and the paper bell are quite different. So \nin the case of the paper bell, you cannot say the gold bell has become weaker. \n19 September 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2611-2613 \nQ. Can some idea be had of what sound is like from higher planes? Does it in any way differ \nin intensity or frequency of vibration from the sound of the physical plane? \nBaba: This is rather difficult to explain, and still more difficult to understand, as it relates to \nsubjective experience. However, know this, that sound obtains throughout all the seven \nplanes, differing in its expression of feeling and bliss. \nThe sound, sight or smell of the higher planes can, with no stretch of the imagination, be \nlikened to what we are used to on the physical plane. It is something altogether different in \nnature, quality and expression. But all the same, for the sake of description and analogy, we \ncan do no better than use the familiar terms, viz., sound, sight and smell. \nOur physical organs of hearing, seeing and smelling are useless for experiencing and \nenjoying the higher planes. Therein it is a different eye that sees, a different ear that hears, \nand a different nose that smells. \nYou know already that there are inner senses, a counterpart of the external senses in man, \nand it is the former that experience the higher planes. Avoiding the mistake of likening the \nsound of the higher planes as something differing in frequency of vibrations from the sound \nof the physical plane, know it for certainty that there is actually what may be called sound in \nthe first three planes. The form, beauty, music and bliss of this sound is beyond description. \nThe naad or celestial music (sound) is peculiar to the first plane, and can be experienced or \ninduced by the mantric force. It is on account of this that even an unintelligent repetition or \nreading of scriptures is encouraged and advocated. \nAs stated above, although there is sound in all the seven planes, it is smell that is peculiar to \nthe second and third planes, and sight belongs to the fifth and sixth planes. In the fourth \nplane the bliss of sound, smell and sight are all subdued and repressed. The fourth plane \nconnotes the darkest night of the spiritual journey, wherein even Jesus could not but cry \nout, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' \nIt is for this reason the wayfarer traversing the Path all alone, unaided by a Master, finding \nhimself benighted and forlorn in the fourth plane, is very strongly tempted to make wrong \nuse of his psychic powers of the three lower planes, culminating in the fourth as siddhis \n(kashf-o-karmat). And what a fall this means! It means once again going through the chain \nof evolution right from the beginning - the stone state. \nThe seventh plane stands unique. The sound, sight and smell here is divine in essence, and \nhas no comparison to that emanating from the lower planes. In this plane one does not hear, \nsmell or see, but becomes sound, smell and sight simultaneously, and is divinely conscious \nabout it. \nThe different religious practises and the yogas, after establishing contact with the higher \nplanes, include experiences peculiar to those planes. For instance, contacting the first plane, \nsound, engenders inspiration; the second and third planes, smell, begets intuition; the fifth \nand sixth, sight, gives Illumination. The experience of the fifth and sixth, the Sufis term as \nmarefat (gnosis). The seventh plane stands for Realisation, and this, according to Sufis, is \nHaqiqat (reality). \n1938?

    "text": "THE NOW \nMeher Baba \nIn the Beyond state, time and space are nil - non-existent. In the sphere of duality, time, \nspace, cause and effect exist. \n1937? Nasik, LA p159 \n... The universe is, in itself, nothing but imagination. There is, in fact, only one indivisible and \neternal reality, and it has neither beginning nor end. It is beyond time. \nFrom the point of view of this timeless reality, the whole time process is purely imaginary, \nand billions of years which have passed, and billions of years which are to pass, do not have \neven the value of a second. They are like not having existed at all. \n1939? Di v1 p26 \nThe illusion which most aspirants find it difficult to shake is the belief that the infinite Truth \nis an object which has to be attained in some distant future, and that all life is just a means \nfor this attainment. But if the Truth were to be confined only to the future and not to the \npast or the present, it would not be infinite. It would at once become limited as an event \nwhich has its origin in time. \nAll that life is and has is at once deprived of intrinsic significance if it comes to be regarded \nas merely instrumental to some far-off event. This is definitely a false point of view. \nLife is not meant to be rich in spiritual significance at some distant date, but is so at every \nmoment, if only the mind is disburdened of illusions. It is only through a clear and tranquil \nmind that the true nature of spiritual infinity is grasped as something which is not yet to be, \nbut which already has been, is, and ever will be an eternal self-fulfilment. \nWhen every moment is rich with eternal significance, there is neither the lingering clinging \nto the dead past, nor a longing expectation for the future, but an integral living in the eternal \nnow. It is only through such living that the spiritual infinity of the Truth can be realised in \nlife. \nIt is not right to deprive the present of all importance by subordinating it to an end in the \nfuture; for this means the imaginary accumulation of all importance in the imagined future, \nrather than the perception and realisation of the true importance of everything that exists. \nThere cannot be ebb and tide in eternity, no meaningless intervals between intermittent \nharvests, but a fullness of being which cannot suffer impoverishment of a single instant. \nWhen life seems to be idle or empty, it is not due to any curtailment of the infinity of the \nTruth; but it is due to one's own lack of capacity to enter into its full possession. \nc.1942, India, Di v5 p14-15 \nMaya cannot have a beginning or end in time, because time itself is a creation of maya. Any \nview that makes maya a happening that takes place at some time, and disappears after some \ntime, places maya in time and not time in maya. Time is in maya; maya is not in time. \nTime, as well as all the happenings in time, are the creations of maya. Time comes into \nexistence because of maya, and disappears when maya disappears. God is a timeless reality, \nand the realisation of God, and the disappearance of maya, is a timeless act. So maya is in no \nway limited by time. \nc.1942, India, Di v5 p84-85 \nTo realise God is to dwell in eternity. It is a timeless experience. \nFebruary? 1943, India, LM8 p2848 \nThrough enslavement to the temporary and the passing, man deprives himself of the eternal \nand the lasting. Each moment with which man is confronted can either tighten the grip of \nthe false, or deliver him to the Truth. \nGod is the only reality, and he is the fountainhead of all love, beauty, peace and happiness. \nEven in and through the fleeting now of the false, God is eternally inviting man to himself, \naffirming himself as the Truth of man's being. Those who dare to see and love God in \neveryone and everything, experience him as the everlastingly immediate presence. \nOnly when his mind is utterly detached from the false is it possible for man to disentangle \nhimself from the repetitive clutches of the fleeting moment. Then and only then can he \nbecome established in the eternal now, which everlastingly includes the eternal past and \nthe eternal future. The eternal 'I am' is an unfailing assurance of the only reality which ever \nwas, is, and will be. \nThe way to peace and fulfillment in union with God, the divine beloved, is a daring dive into \nthe eternal now. Not by fruitless surveys of the past, nor by elusive longings for the future, \nnor by enslavement to the fleeting moment, but by staking everything for God, is it possible \nfor you to experience yourself as the illimitable ocean of love. Here and nowhere else is the \nfinal solution of all your problems. Love born in the Truth liberates without binding and \nfulfills without overpowering. It is a pure blessing, not only for yourself, but for each and all, \nfor ever and ever, in the eternal now. \nc.1956, LB p56-58 \nActually the goal is neither far nor near, and there is no distance to cross, nor time to count. \nIn eternity, all is here and now. You have simply to become that which you are. You are God, \nthe infinite existence. \nc.1960, India, EN p50 \nFor me, past does not exist. I live in the eternal present. \nc.1960, India, EN p54 \nLive more and more in the present, which is ever beautiful and stretches away beyond the \nlimits of the past and the future. \nc.1959, India, LM 5809 \nAnother version: EN p62 \nAstronomers speak of time in terms of billions, trillions and aeons of years. Even these \nfigures are not adequate for their mathematical calculations, and they may be required to \ncoin new terms. \nIf I were to try and explain in astronomical terms the beginning and end of time, it would \nnever depict the beginning and end of time in eternity. \nThere is always an 'ago and there is always an 'after' to every point in time. The yesterdays \nof the past and the tomorrows of the future hinge on a point in time which is the now of the \npresent moment in eternity. \nIn a flight of imagination, imagining the beginning and the end of the now of the present \nmoment in eternity, one can at the most either add or subtract a measure of time; but this \nwould be nothing more than an adding or erasing of zeros. No amount of swing - even of \naeons of cycles - in the sweep of time can give an iota of concept of any beginning or end of \nthe now in eternity. \nc.1960, EN p90 \nTime never existed at all. \n4 October 1965, Meherazad \nto Lyn and Phyllis Ott, \nLM 6393 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

Then why try to get a superficial \nknowledge of the imaginative universe, rather than acquire the knowledge of self (Truth)? \nWhat is knowledge? Knowledge means the experience of Paramatma (Dnyan) - the \nknowledge of the highest that our soul, which is everlasting, gets of the Supreme Being, i.e., \nSelf-realisation. \nWhat is the universal understanding? It is called Vishva Dnyan, or the knowledge of the \nuniverse with which one comes down after realisation of Paramatma (Dnyan), i.e. \nknowledge of God and the Nirvikalpa state. That is to say, knowledge equals experience plus \nuniversal understanding, or perfect knowledge of that experience. Meaning again that he \nwho acquires knowledge must necessarily acquire experience, and then again, he must have \na perfect knowledge of that experience. Otherwise, those who acquire experience and \nremain in that Nirvikalpa state (the state of Ananta Ananda or everlasting bliss) are called \nMajzoobs. Although they are all-knowing and perfect in every way, they are unable to do \nanything for, or give salvation to, the world. \nIn short, the experience of the state of the Supreme Being (God) is the real state. \nNow let us see what this experience is that one gets before acquiring the real knowledge. \nThe Sadgurus or Realised ones take those to whom they are to give this experience through \nthe seven planes absolutely in the dark - either with bandages around their eyes, or with \ntheir eyes closed. That is, those to whom the Sadguru gives the experience have no \nknowledge of these seven planes. They are quite ignorant of that knowledge, though they \nhave already crossed all these seven planes. \nIt is for this reason that when the candidate for this experience is let off by the Sadguru just \nbelow the seventh plane, his state is unimaginable and indescribable. It is as if an \nunexpected current of millions of candlepower of electric light enters or dissolves his Subtle \nbody. He is amazed and stupefied at this new experience. \nThen, before he can properly think of his new, unimaginably wonderful experience, he \nsuddenly acquires the Nirvikalpa state, where he himself becomes one with the Ananta \nAnanda or eternal bliss. \nBut it is useless to realise all this without personal experience. One may listen to years of \nexplanations, or read volume after volume, but one would not get even a glimpse of an idea - \na shadow of a shadow - of the real experience, without experiencing it personally. \nSuch a perfect state is attained by one out of millions, and that too, only by the grace of a \nSadguru. To talk about this knowledge and experience without acquiring it - to realise it \nonly through philosophy or the superficial knowledge of religion - is utter folly - humbug, \npure and simple. \n29 April 1926, \nMeherabad, \nAw 16:1 p3-4 \nBefore Realisation, the veil must be torn away and the mind must die. It is due to this veil \nthat every individual mind functions in the Gross and Subtle bodies. Removing the veil \nwould separate the Gross from the Subtle. When that occurs, in the Subtle state you would \nbe able to see internal things with as much clarity as you see Gross objects. While doing all \nphysical activities, such as eating, drinking, sitting, standing - while your body is functioning \n- there is simultaneous progress into the Subtle world. When the Gross is separated from \nthe Subtle, it is like killing two birds with one stone. \nBut the veil must be ripped off. Though this veil is thin, at the same time it is very strong. It \ncannot be slit easily, but it can be rent in an instant by a Perfect Master. If it is torn, the \nconsciousness of the soul at once enters the first plane. When a parrot escapes from its cage, \nit flies straight into the air without looking back. \nBut progress comes to a halt at the first plane if the rent in the veil is made through one's \nown efforts, or with the help of a yogi or saint - an imperfect guru. Seekers advance on their \nown, but it is ultimately useless, as they inevitably become entrapped. If a Perfect Master is \nthere to help, he would not tear the veil unless the aspirant is fully ready. Then the Master \nwould take him straight to the goal. \nOnly a Sadguru can free one from the cage of illusion. But three conditions are required: \nlonging, patience, and rock-like faith. Nothing is gained without longing. This is all that is \nneeded, but the aspirant should remain restless. For instance, if a man is stung by a \nscorpion, he constantly thinks of how to overcome the burning, throbbing pain. He forgets \nabout eating, drinking and worldly pursuits. He forgets everything, and has only one \nthought: how to make the pain subside. \nIn the same way, there should be continual longing to be one with God. There should be no \nother thought except this: 'I must be one with God today - immediately - this moment!' The \nmind and heart must be devoid of any other thought. \nEven though many years of suffering may pass, patience should never be forsaken. At first \nthe longing is intense, but gradually it lessens and cools down. This should not be the case. \nPatience must not be lost. It must be persistent. In the beginning there is great enthusiasm, \nand a person is convinced he will soon gain Realisation. But with the passing of time, his \nenthusiasm wanes. \nA person may be purposely snared by the Master and then thrown out. I too do such things. \nBut a wise man silently puts up with everything that comes from a Master. One who is \nunwise becomes impatient and starts grumbling. But Masters always coax the aspirant \nalong, and gradually give him a push on the Path. Masters always behave like this; it is their \nnature. \nCrossing the Path is like a pulling-pushing tug of war. But a wise man does not act in this \nway. A smart bird who is caught in a trap does not flap its wings to free itself. It remains \nquiet and unflustered, waiting for an opportunity to escape. An inexperienced bird flutters \nand squirms, becoming flustered and injuring itself more. \nThink how patient Hafez remained, to have endured the treatment of his Master for forty \nyears. Your steadfastness and determination should be like the steady flow of castor oil \nwhen poured. \nDo not be after gatekeepers or watchmen. Catch hold of the Emperor. Never be after his \nservants. No minister or secretary will help. A king is, after all, a king, and his servants only \nservants. Once you have approached the king directly, it is of no benefit to maintain a \nfriendly attitude with his servants. Your friendship with the king might precipitate any \nsituation, but you should stick to him. Even if you were about to die, you should never let go \nof his hand. \nThe Emperor is perfect knowledge. One should forget everyone and everything in his \ncompany. One should stop one's previous habits. One should not think of meditating or \nrepeating God's name, or any other type of worship. The most that could happen with any of \nthese practises is that you would enter samadhi. Such practises can never make you one \nwith God. \nInstead, one should submit oneself to the Emperor's will, having only this thought: 'O God, \nwhen will you meet me?' \nThis longing must be present twenty-four hours a day. If the feeling is intense enough, God \nwill surely fulfill it. \nTo help people is good, but service done under the guidance and according to the \ninstructions of a Perfect Master is the best. Service to half-baked gurus and false saints will \nthrow you into a gutter. You will be left hanging by those hypocrites. If you are unlucky \nenough to find a false guru, he will accept you and take you into his service. However, he \nwill then give you up, and that will cool down your longing! Instead of losing, you will \naccumulate sanskaras, and become disappointed and disgusted. \nThese false saints cannot give you anything, while... Walis and Pirs of the fifth and sixth \nplane can raise you to a higher state with just one look. But that is not the Perfect state, as \nthese advanced souls are not Perfect. At times, even Perfect Masters cannot help those \ncaught in these nets. Therefore, except for the Perfect Ones, do not even by beguiled by the \nadvanced souls of the fifth and sixth planes. \nStick to the Emperor and don't leave him for any reason. I am in everyone. But if you catch \nhold of me, you will have the root of all creation in your hands. Then you will not need to go \nafter the branches and leaves. If you are lucky enough to catch hold of the Emperor, you \nshould never, never leave him. \nGo on digging until you find water. Don't keep changing the spot. If you get impatient, by \ndigging two feet here and four feet there, you will never strike water. If you only dig a \nshallow well, you will get impure water. Only patient, laborious digging will result in your \nfinding crystal-pure water. And for that, you have to exert energy and dig deep. \nThis Path is not easy at all, and if you enter it, you will not find joy here. Therefore, I warn, \nthink seven times before entering it. If you are after God, you will have to give up everything \n- your father, your mother, the whole world. You have to renounce each and every thing. \nTherefore, ponder well, and then take your step. If not, leave this Path and attend to your \nworldly duties. \nOnce you fall for the Path, don't be afraid of anything in the world. 'Who will look after my \nparents? How about my job? What will the world think of me?' All these thoughts are \nuseless. If you had died, who would have looked after your near and dear ones? Those \naffected will care for themselves. God takes care of everyone. He is the true sustainer. Once \nyou have entered the Path, you should desist from such thoughts. \nTry to be a lover of God. If you find out how to love him, you may go mad. The real lover is \nnever influenced by the world or what people think of him. He will not even care for his life. \nHe will remain what he is - totally indifferent to the world, unashamed of anything. \nAll rivers flow in me. I am the ocean. Stop looking elsewhere, and look only at the ocean. By \nconcentrating on me, you yourself will become the ocean. To look at the ocean means to \ncarry out my wishes at all times. \n6 September 1929, \nBombay, \nto Kaikhushru Pleader, \nLM4 p1213-1216 \nSo much has been said and written about the highest consciousness and God-realisation \nthat people are bewildered as to the right process and immediate possibility of attainment. \nThe philosophical mind, wading laboriously through such literature, only ends by learning a \nfew intellectual gymnastics. \nThe highest state of consciousness is latent in all. The Son of God is in every man, but \nrequires to be manifested. The method of attaining this great consciousness must be very \npractical, and must be adapted to the existing mental and material conditions of the world... \nIn the evolutionary ascent from the mineral, vegetable and animal life, the latent mind \ngradually expands and develops till full consciousness is reached in the human form. To \ncreate this very consciousness, the universe emanated from the infinite ocean of knowledge \nand bliss, God the absolute. \nIn the human form, however, a difficulty is confronted, to remove which prophets and \nspiritual Masters have periodically visited this earthly plane. Besides full consciousness in \nthe human form, as a result of previous conditions of life, the ego, the 'I' is evolved. The ego \nis composed of fulfilled and unfulfilled desires, and creates the illusion of feeling finite, weak \nand unhappy. \nHenceforth the soul can only progress through the gradual suppression of this finite ego, \nand its transformation into the divine ego, the one infinite self, but retaining in full the \nconsciousness of the human form. When man realises this state of divine consciousness, he \nfinds himself in everyone, and sees all phenomena as forms of his own real self. \nThe best and also the easiest process of overcoming the ego and attaining the divine \nconsciousness is to develop love and render selfless service to humanity in whatever \ncircumstances we are placed. All ethics and religious practices ultimately lead to this. The \nmore we live for others and less for ourselves, the more the low desires are eliminated, and \nthis, in turn, reacts upon the ego, suppressing and transforming it proportionately. \nThe ego persists till the last. Not till all six out of the seven principal stages on the Path, \nculminating in the God-conscious state, are traversed, is the ego completely eliminated, to \nreappear on the seventh plane as the divine I, the state of Christ-consciousness, to which \nJesus referred when he said 'I and my Father are one,' and which corresponds to the state of \nliving in the infinite and the finite at one and the same time. \nThe above is the normal procedure for one who works on his own initiative without having \ncome across a living Master. With the help of a Perfect Master, the whole affair, however, is \ngreatly simplified. Complete surrender to the divine will of the Perfect one, and unflinching \nreadiness to carry out his orders, rapidly achieve a result not possible even by rigidly \npractising all the ethics of the world for a thousand years. \nThe extraordinary results achieved by a Perfect Master are due to the fact that, being one \nwith the Universal Mind, he is present in the mind of every human being, and can therefore \ngive just the particular help needed to awaken the highest consciousness latent in every \nindividual. Perfection, however, in order to achieve the greatest result on the material \nplane, must possess a human touch and a keen sense of humor... \nThe highest is latent in everyone, but has to be manifested. \n29 May 1932, \nHollywood, California, \nMe p90-93 \nTrue spirituality can be attained, not by the intellect, but by heart and feeling, by inner \nexperience. \nAv p137 \nIt is not through intellectual exercises and such learning, or knowledge acquired by reading \nor hearing lectures, that spiritual truths can be understood. At the most, these can give one \nan intellectual understanding, which is the first preparatory stage for ushering one into the \nPath. What is essential is a true inner feeling, an actual experience of the Truth, which is \nreal, lasting and convincing. When one experiences union with God, one knows by actual \nexperience that one is in harmony with everything and everyone, that there is nothing but \none infinite indivisible existence, and all else is but fleeting shadows. \n26 June 1939, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2432 \nThere are three worlds or planes, and corresponding to them, there are three bodies, the \nGross, the Subtle and the Mental. These worlds or planes should not be mixed up with the \nidea of place or sphere. The purpose of evolution is served with the attainment of the \nhuman form plus full consciousness. Simultaneous with the human body, the Subtle and \nMental bodies make their appearance. \nThere is also another body, called the Astral body, which persists long after death, and \nbelongs to the Sub-Subtle or lower of the seven regions of the Subtle plane. It is connected \nwith both the Subtle and Gross planes or worlds. The Astral body is exactly the replica of the \nhuman body in all details. As is the Astral body, so will be the Gross body. The former is \nvapory or smoky in appearance, unlike the Subtle body, which has form, but no defined \norgans. The experience of heaven and hell, enjoyment and suffering, is undergone by this \nbody, and no sooner are the sanskaras acquired while in the Gross body spent up, than the \nAstral body is destroyed, leaving faint impressions on the Subtle body. \nThe Subtle world represents desires, ego and energy. The Subtle bodies on this plane have \nforms of light (Tej or Noor) known as Angels. The light-form of these Angels or spirits can \nwith no stretch of imagination be compared to the sun, which can be said to be the shadow \nof this light. \nThe dissolution of the Subtle plane is the phenomena which we term as Qiamat or \nMahapralaya, and both the Gross and Subtle worlds recede and remain involved in the \nMental plane in seed form. \nThe Mental or seed-body is a point of light (Causal body) on this plane. Extended or \nmagnified, it's called the Supra-Mental body. The Sub-Mental plane is the rest-house of \nWalis of the sixth plane, and the Supra-Mental plane is the abode of Archangels. This plane, \nunlike the Subtle and the Gross, is eternal in character. \nThe Archangels are a creation by themselves, and are embodiments of God's qualities. In \norder to realise God, unlike the Angels or spirits, who are all evolved beings, the Archangels, \nafter a cyclic period, directly take the human form and achieve the object in one lifetime. \nThe reason why is this. The ocean of divinity consists of drops and waves in a latent form. \nAs soon as the surface of the ocean was ruffled with motion, the waves came into being, and \nthese waves have all the attributes of the ocean in them. These big waves are the \nArchangels, the manifestations of the principle attributes of God, such as Brahma, Vishnu \nand Mahesh. \nThe effort to cause the big waves, i.e., the Archangels, has resulted in producing \nconsciousness, but of rather an impotent nature. In order to remedy this deficiency, and to \ndevelop and attain full and complete consciousness, as that of human form, the Archangels \neven have to incarnate as human beings at the end of every cycle - which, according to our \ncomputation or measure of time, may come to three or four hundred years. \nLet it be understood here that the Subtle and Mental planes also are within the orbit \ngoverned by time, place and causation. Since the three worlds, the Gross, Subtle and Mental, \nare the projections of, and exist in, imagination, there is no such thing as length of time, \nbeginning, or end. In reality, all time is now, all space is here. The measure or idea of time \nhas a relative existence in our mind, and with all that it differs considerably on the different \nplanes. For instance, a unit of time - say one year on the Gross plane - may mean one minute \non the Mental plane. And one minute on the Gross plane - to one on the Mental plane - may \nlook like one year. \nThe experiences of Narada and the Jew in the time of Pirane Pir of Baghdad, are proof \npositive of the Archangelic experience imparted to these personages on the Gross plane. \nThis explains the apparent illusion in years of time which they experienced in the short \nspan of a minute on the Gross plane. \nAw 15: 3&4 p62-64 \nOn the spiritual Path there are six stations, the seventh station being the terminus or the \ngoal. Each intermediate station is, in its own way, a kind of an imaginative anticipation of \nthe goal. \nThe veil which separates man from God consists of false imagination. And this veil of false \nimagination has, as it were, many folds. Before entering the Path, the man is shrouded in \nthis veil of manifold imagination, with the result that he cannot even entertain the thought \nof his being other than a separate and enclosed finite individual. \nThe ego-consciousness has crystallised out of the working of the manifold false imagination, \nand the conscious longing for union with God is the first shaking of the entire structure of \nthe ego, which has come to be built through the period of the false working of imagination. \nThe traversing of the spiritual Path consists in the undoing of the results of the false \nworking of imagination, or the dropping of the several folds of the veil, which has created \nthe sense of unassailable separateness and unredeemable isolation. \n1940? Di v2 p30-31 \nEach definite stage of advancement represents a state of consciousness. And the \nadvancement from one state of consciousness to another proceeds side by side with the \ncrossing of the inner planes. Thus there are six intermediate planes and states of \nconsciousness which have to be experienced before getting established in the seventh plane, \nwhich is the end of the journey, and where there is a final realisaton of the God-state. \n1940? Di v2 p33 \nWhen the time is ripe, the advancement of a person towards self-knowledge comes about as \nnaturally as the physical body of the child grows into the full-fledged form. The growth of \nthe physical body is worked out by the operation of natural laws, whereas the progress of \nthe aspirant toward self-knowledge is worked out by the operation of the spiritual laws \npertaining to the transformation and emancipation of consciousness. \nThe physical body of the child grows very gradually and almost imperceptibly, and the same \nis true of the spiritual progress of the  person who has once entered the Path. The child does \nnot know how its physical body grows. The aspirant also is, in the same way, often oblivious \nof the law according to which he makes headway towards the destination of his spiritual \nprogress. The aspirant is generally conscious only of the manner in which he has been \nresponding to the diverse situations in life. But he is rarely conscious of the manner in \nwhich he makes progress towards self-knowledge. \nBut without consciously knowing it, the aspirant is gradually arriving at self-knowledge by \ntraversing the inner Path through his joys and sorrows, his happiness and suffering, his \nsuccesses and failures, his efforts and rest, and through his moments of clear perception and \nharmonised will, as well as through the moments of confusion and conflict. \n1940? Di v2 p37 \nThe spiritual Path is like climbing up to the mountain-top through hills and dales and thorny \nwoods, and along steep and dangerous precipices. But on this Path there can be no going \nback or halting. Everyone must get to the top, which is the direct realisation of the supreme \nGodhead. All hesitation or sidetracking or resting in the halfway houses is but \npostponement of the day of true and final fulfillment. \nYou cannot be too alert on this Path. Even the slightest of lingering in the false world of \nshadows is necessarily an invitation to some suffering which could have been avoided if the \neyes had been steadily fixed on the supreme goal of life. \nIf there is one thing which is most necessary for safe and sure arrival at the top, it is love. All \nother qualifications which are essential for the aspirants of the highest can and must come \nto them if they faithfully follow the whispers of the unerring guide of love, who speaks from \nwithin their own hearts and sheds light on the Path. \nIf you lose hold of the mantle of this guide, there is only despair in store for you. The heart \nwithout love is entombed in unending darkness and suffering. But the heart which is \nrestless with love is on the way to realisation of the unfading light and the unfathomable \nsweetness of life divine. \nHuman love should not be despised, even when it is fraught with limitations. It is bound to \nbreak through all these limitations and initiate the aspirant into the eternal life in the Truth, \nso that the lover loses his separate and false self, and gets united with God, who is the one \nmatchless and indivisible ocean of unsurpassable love. \nThe gateway to this highest state of being one with God is firmly closed for all who do not \nhave the courage to lose their separate existence in the restless fire of divine love. I give my \nblessings to all who are thirsting for the full realisation of divinity, for they shall be the \npillars of the coming era of Truth and love. \n12 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p69-70 \nIn an important sense, all walks of life and all paths ultimately lead but to one goal, God. All \nrivers enter into the ocean, in spite of the diverse directions in which they flow, and in spite \nof the many meanderings which characterise their paths. However, there are certain high \nroads which take the pilgrim directly to his divine destination. They are important because \nthey avoid prolonged wanderings in the wilderness of complicated byways in which the \npilgrim is often unnecessarily caught up. \nThe rituals and ceremonies of organised religions can lead the seeker only to the threshold \nof the true inner journey, which proceeds along certain high roads. These remain distinct \nfrom each other for a very considerable distance, though towards the end they all get \nmerged in each other. In the earlier phases they remain distinct, owing to the diversity of \nsanskaric contexts of individuals and the differences of their temperaments. In any case, it \nshould be clear from the very beginning that though the roads may be many, the goal is and \nalways will be only one, attainment of union with God. \nThe quickest of these high roads lies through the God-man, who is consciously one with the \nTruth. In the God-man, God reveals himself in all his glory with his infinite power, \nunfathomable knowledge, inexpressible bliss and eternal existence. The path through the \nGod-man is available only to those fortunate ones who approach him in complete \nsurrenderance and unswerving faith. Complete surrenderance to the God-man is, however, \npossible only to very advanced aspirants. But when this is not possible, the other high roads \nwhich can eventually win the grace of God are: \n1. Love for God, and intense longing to see him and to be united with him. \n2. Being in constant company with the saints and lovers of God, and rendering them \nwholehearted service. \n3. Avoiding lust, greed, anger, hatred and the temptations for power, fame and fault- finding. \n4. Leaving everyone and everything in complete external renunciation, and in solitude, \ndevoting oneself to fasting, prayer and meditation. \n5. Carrying on all worldly duties with equal acceptance of success or failure, with a pure \nheart and clean mind, and remaining unattached in the midst of intense activity. \n6. Selfless service of humanity, without any thought of gain or reward. \n1952? PL p76-77 \nThis present state is Gross-conscious state, and Gross senses are used to experience all the \nGross experiences of seeing, smelling, etc. This is the Gross world. The consciousness you \nhave now is Gross. \nManzil means destination. Mukam means place of stay. These terms must be distinguished. \nNow you are in the Gross manzil, and in the Gross manzil there are innumerable places of \nstay. For example, with all of you here in Meherabad, your manzil is one and the same. You \nexperience in Meherabad with the Gross senses all the Gross things. When you are in \nAmerica or Australia, manzil is the same, Gross, but mukam is different, and according to \nmukam you have different experiences of the Gross world itself. A man in Arangaon village, \none who seldom goes even to Ahmednagar, if he were to be blindfolded, made to sit in an \nairplane, and put on Broadway, eyes open, at night, his experiences would be wonderful, yet \nit is of the same Gross world. Therefore the innumerable experiences of the different \nmukams in different circumstances are due to one and the same manzil. \nNow, even in the Gross manzil, i.e. the Gross-conscious state, glimpses of the first manzil of \nthe Subtle plane are possible. Just try to grasp now, even in the Gross manzil it is possible to \nget glimpses of the Subtle. The Subtle plane has three manzils. Now what happens: this \nhuman being with Gross senses experiences the first manzil of the Subtle in his own way, \nbecause the senses are Gross. But experience of the Subtle cannot be fully gained except \nthrough the Subtle senses. So this human being sees color, circles of all kinds, smells, hears \nmusic, becomes inspired, but all vanish, disappear. Now we must understand that all \nmanzils, mukams are illusory, and only God is real. \nWhen one, through his herculean efforts and by the grace of his guru, gets into the first \nplane, it does not mean that he enters another world or sphere. No, that is not the thing. His \nconsciousness is raised, and he can use his Subtle senses directly, fully, so what he smelled, \nheard, etc., temporarily before, now he sees, smells, hears continuously. He is now in the \nfirst manzil of the Subtle world. And just as the Gross world has innumerable mukams, the \nSubtle world has also mukams. The first manzil has mukams where through Subtle senses \none sees, smells, hears music, etc., just as in the Gross world one hears music, etc. So in the \nSubtle world the first manzil has innumerable mukams where one sees different things and \none feels different. For example, you see and feel differently at Meherabad than at your \nhome. So in Subtle manzil, one sees wonderful sights, and if one gets entranced, then one \nloses Gross consciousness. \nBut if one is wise through fortune and past sanskaras, and if the guru is capable, then one \nleaves the first and enters the second manzil in the Subtle world. This manzil is more \nintense, and one sees, hears all through the Subtle senses, but more intensely. The same \nmukams of the Subtle world now appear more real. The second manzil is a talisman, and \none becomes overpowered by what one sees. But all this rebounds upon him, and he cannot \nget free of it. \nThe light that he sees is a billion times more brilliant than the sun, and a million times \ncooler than the moon. He gets enveloped in this light, and so he feels he is light. But it is \ndelusion. In the same way, he feels a voice so intensely it overpowers him, and he gets into it \nfrom head to foot. He has no Gross consciousness, and if the body is not capable, and if past \nimpressions do not allow, he remains in that state and drops his body. When he is reborn, \nhe returns to that same state. \nBut if he has sense - spiritual talisman - or if the guru is adept in this spiritual line, he \nadvances from this state, and the third manzil is reached. Consciousness is still Subtle, and \nagain there are innumerable mukams. The Subtle senses are used in this manzil to the \nmaximum. Now what he sees are the innumerable sights of the innumerable mukams, but \nwhat he sees does not overpower him. He now controls the senses, and experiences all this \nwith full control, not only over the senses, but also with full control in the Gross manzil and \nthe two previous Subtle manzils. He is now energy personified. \nHe still has Gross body, is still in the Gross world, but also simultaneously in the Subtle \nworld - i.e. he uses his Gross and Subtle senses simultaneously. If Francis were in the third \nmanzil of the Subtle world, you would see him sitting, but at the same time he would be \nexperiencing the third manzil of the Subtle world. He now has infinite energy in his hands, \nand he can use this energy for the Gross world. But this is still illusion, it is not the Truth. \nNow the pilgrim goes to the fourth plane of consciousness. This plane is known as the \njunction between the Subtle and Mental planes. It is also called astana, meaning threshold, \nand there is no manzil and no mukams. It is just a junction where all the infinite energy and \nthe desires, emotions and feelings of the Mental plane influence directly. \nThe soul is now neither in the Subtle nor in the Mental planes, but all powers of the Subtle \nand all influences of the Mental are continually with him in this fourth plane. Remember, \nthis plane has no manzil and no mukams. Here one is overpowered with desires, and one is \nso powerful that one can accomplish whatever he desires. And so in this plane the soul is \nsaid to be in the greatest danger of falling down. If the desires control him, he falls down. He \ncan do anything: raise the dead, create new forms, etc. Desires are influencing him, and if he \nsuccumbs, he falls down. If he does not succumb to desires to use his infinite energy for \nselfish ends, then he is pushed to the fifth plane, the fifth manzil. \nSummary: In the Gross world, there is the first manzil and innumerable mukams. In the first \nplane of the Subtle world, there is the second manzil and innumerable mukams. In the \nsecond plane of the Subtle world, there is the third manzil and innumerable mukams. In the \nthird plane of the Subtle world, there is the fourth manzil and innumerable mukams. In the \nfourth plane of the Subtle world, there is no manzil or mukams. In the fifth plane, there is \nthe fifth manzil and mukams. \nIn the fifth state of Mental consciousness (fifth plane, which is in the Mental sphere) the soul \nis working directly from the Mental plane. So now he is master of mind. The whole mental \nplane is now governed by him. He knows the thoughts of all, and knows the desires. And yet \nhe is now said to be safe, to have passed the dark spiritual night of the fourth plane, and he \ncannot now fall. But with what section of the mind does he control? He knows thoughts and \ndesires, but he cannot control desires. In this fifth plane, when he controls thoughts and \nknows thoughts, he cannot have that intense longing for God that lovers who do not care for \nthe planes have. \nWhen he is pushed on to the sixth plane, meaning the second section of the mind, he is now \nfeelings and desires personified. And as all infinite feelings come out of God, who is in the \nseventh state, this man of the sixth directly sees God in everything and everyone. Yet he \nfeels himself aloof from the world. \nNow there is the great abyss where the lover sees the beloved, but in between there is a \ngreat valley. The beloved says, 'Come to me,' and the lover replies, 'I cannot. You come to \nme.' This glorious state is described as a length of hair between the beloved and the lover, \none end in the lover's hand and the other in the hand of the beloved, with each pulling. This \ntussle goes on and on for years and years. If millions of such lovers were to long for union, \none out of these can reach the beloved. And on the sixth plane, very, very few lovers are \nfound. \nWhen one crosses the valley and unites with God, he finds that it was himself that he loved \nand was seeking. He now declares, 'I am God.' It is said that out of thousands united with \nGod, only one comes down to normal consciousness. Such a one is called Qutub. So the \nseventh plane has manzil but no mukam, while the sixth plane has manzil and one mukam, \nGod. \nSummary: There are seven manzils in all, and there are mukams in six of the manzils. \nSeptember 1954, \nMeherabad, \nTK p337-341 \nAlthough the unfurling realisation of divine knowledge is often figuratively described as \n'traversing the Path,' this analogy should not be taken too literally. There is no ready-made \nroad in the spiritual realm. Spiritual progress is not a matter of moving along a line already \nlaid down and unalterably defined. Rather it is a creative process of spiritual involution of \nconsciousness, and this process is better described as a spiritual journey than as the \ntraversing of a path. \nThe journey is comparable, in fact, to a flight through the air, and not to a journey upon the \nEarth, because it is truly a pathless journey. It is a dynamic movement within the \nconsciousness of the aspirant that creates its own path, and leaves no trace behind it. \nThe metaphor of 'the Path' is helpful to the aspirant in the early stages of his development, \nbecause it gives him the sense of new phases of consciousness to be experienced. This \nanticipation is stimulated further by accounts of others who have completed the spiritual \njourney. This makes the pilgrim's ascent easier than if it depended solely upon his own \nunguided efforts to visualise the probable Path. \nWhile trying to understand the Path as described by the Masters, the aspirant must also \nmake use of his own imaginative faculty, but within the constructive bounds defined in the \nMaster's spiritual guidance. Actual spiritual experience is as far removed from uncontrolled \nimaginative expectation as reality is from chaotic dreams. Though the imagination of the \npilgrim is inevitably determined by past experience, it must offer no resistance to the \ndirectional suggestions of the Master... \nbefore 1956, \nLH p157-158 \nIt is natural for the human mind to desire to know the general structure of the universe. It is \nalso helpful to have a sort of chart of the universe in which one finds oneself. The fabric of \nthe universe includes the spheres and the planes, and the different bodies with which a \nhuman soul is endowed. \nThe Gross, Subtle and Mental spheres are interpenetrating globes, and have an existence in \nspace. They can be regarded as places since they have an expansion in space. The planes, on \nthe other hand, are both places and states, though the state of a particular plane cannot be \nexperienced unless one's consciousness first gets raised to it and begins to function from \nthere. \nThere are 49 steps in the ascent through the planes. The human mind delights in perceiving \nand creating symmetry and proportion everywhere, but this tendency should not be carried \ninto the realm of facts. The 49 steps in the Path are not evenly distributed within the seven \nplanes. They are distinguished from each other because of their distinguishing psychic \ncharacteristics, although they have also structural equivalents in the subdivisions of the \nseven planes... \nJust as a change of place in the physical world is linked with changes in the mental state and \ngathered experiences, an ascent to a plane also brings about changes in states and \nexperiences. An ascent to a plane means a change in the standing ground of consciousness. \nIt is a change of place. It therefore brings with it the changes in states and experiences. \n1956? Be p11-12, 84 \nFor those on the spiritual Path, I am the sun, giving light and life to them. \nThere are some who blast themselves completely in the rays and the heat of this sun. \nSome want only the warmth of the sun, and they are a little away from the spiritual Path. \nThere are others who want to be in the comfortable shade, and who also carry an umbrella \nwhen they tread on the spiritual Path. \nThese three types are on the spiritual Path. \n23 February 1958, \nMeherabad, \nAw 7:2 p30 \nDo persons on the spiritual planes of consciousness take birth having consciousness of the \nsame plane? \nYes, but the consciousness is very gradual, as when a person of gross-consciousness dies \nand is reborn with consciousness of the gross world. The child gradually becomes aware, as \nit grows older, of the same old gross world according to past experiences of the gross. \nA child born with consciousness of a certain plane is not all at once conscious of the plane. \nThe plane unfolds very gradually as the child gradually grows. Later in life, this child, grown \nup as a man, gets established in the life of his respective plane-consciousness, as a man of \nthe gross world gets established in his worldly way. \nThus, a person of the gross world dies to reincarnate as of the gross world; so also a person \nof a particular plane of consciousness reincarnates as of that respective plane of \nconsciousness and then gradually gets established in the plane of consciousness of his \nprevious life. \nHe may or may not make further progress in the planes of higher consciousness. Progress \nwill depend on the help of a Perfect Master, or on his own efforts in the life of that particular \nplane of consciousness. \nPL p84 \nAnother version of the same quote: \nWhen one dies in a certain plane of consciousness, he takes his next birth in that same plane \nof consciousness. But the respective consciousness comes very gradually, the same as when \na person of Gross consciousness dies, and is reborn with consciousness of the Gross world. \nThe child gradually becomes aware as it grows older of the same Gross world. \nThe child born in a certain plane is not at once conscious of that plane. It becomes aware \ngradually. As a man, the child becomes aware of his plane of consciousness. A Gross-\nconscious child becomes aware of the Gross world gradually, and a person in a certain plane \nof consciousness gradually becomes aware of his plane of consciousness. \nHe may or may not go further in that life. It depends on the help of a spiritual guide, or help \nof one's own efforts, or help of a Perfect Master, whether or not his consciousness expands. \n26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, \nHM p311-312 \nYet another version: \nGM p329 \n... The Gross, Subtle, Mental and God are all within you in human form. Don't try to find \nSubtle, Mental and God in some other world. It is in you in human form. It is just the change \nin the vision of consciousness which gives the change of experiencing different planes and \nworlds. \nNow in the Gross world there is human consciousness, and here on this Earth, and in the \nwhole universe, also in the Subtle world and Mental world, there are innumerable \nexperiences. But the experiences that you have in this Gross world, these experiences are \nquite different from the experiences of the Subtle world, absolutely different from the \nSubtle world. But it is all in you. You don't go anywhere. You do not rise to higher \ngeographical or geometrical levels. It is all here. \nBut as the angle of vision changes through experiencing different things, in the end you \nbegin to experience yourself as God. After having an infinite number of experiences, you \neventually, ultimately experience yourself as God. That is the end. That one ultimate \nexperience is the real experience. All other experiences of the Gross world, the Subtle, the \nMental, all these experiences are illusory. \nSo all states, even hell, limbo, worlds, planes, are all in you in human form. Don't ask in \nother places, ask within you. But to eventually become your own self, you have to love me. \nNo other remedy, no other solution but to love me. \n26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, \nHM p312 \nAnother version: GM p330 \nQ. What is the spiritual Path, and what is the criterion for knowing that one is on the Path? \nBaba: When you begin to think of yourself as being on the Path, then you are not. The Path is \nnot a defined direction set apart from you, for it begins and ends within yourself. It is not so \nmuch that more of the Path is traversed, as it is that more of the veil of ignorance is lifted. In \nshort, the Path is 'I want nothing.' However, although this denotes a freedom from wanting \nanything, even this desire for nothing is a want and a binding that must ultimately be \neffaced before you can reach the goal and attain that total freedom from all wanting. \nQ. However repeatedly one makes a determined beginning, enthusiasm slowly diminishes \nwhen there seems to be nothing to show for one's efforts, and this is followed by a feeling of \nmental depression. \nBaba: Whatever efforts you make, whatever failures seem to result, and whatever \ndiscouragement follows, all have their root in the fact that you love yourself more than you \nlove God. And in loving yourself as wholeheartedly as you should have loved God, it is but \nnatural that failures and despair will bar your way. Therefore do not let the fact of your \ndepression burden you. \nHave you reflected on the source of this depression? It emerged unsought and unasked, and \nas such it must vanish. All your forced efforts to stifle it will only result in imprinting it still \ndeeper on your mind and create further binding. So be completely indifferent to it and it will \ndisappear. The solution is to love God as he should be loved. It is love for God alone that \ncounts. \n1959, \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nto local news reporters, AO p168 \nYou have read much of spiritual literature. You are well-known for your lucid expositions. \nSpiritual understanding takes one nearer the Path, but remember well that the experience \nof the Path is quite a different matter. The higher states of consciousness can never be \nimagined through book-knowledge. \nAs one travels the spiritual Path, one comes across varied experiences, such as visions, \nsweet notes of sound, and delightful scents. In the more advanced stages, one can \ndetachedly watch his body moving about. The many experiences that one has on the Path \nare not lasting, but the experience in which one becomes what he is in reality is perennial. \nThen in whatever thoughts or actions such a one may seem to be engaged, maya cannot \ntouch him. In that state, everything is experienced in its infinite intensity. How can spiritual \nunderstanding derived from books imagine this state? Intellect is bound to fail to fathom \nthis experience. \nMeher Baba, to an engineer, \nApril, May or June 1960, \nGuruprasad, Poona, Da p29 \nmaya = the principle of ignorance \nIf you read 'God Speaks' you will know the details about the different states and stages of \nconsciousness. Also, you must bear in mind that mere intellectual understanding has very \nlittle value by itself. Whether one understands the details of the Path or not, it is just the \nsame. Only love counts. To learn God is to unlearn yourself. \nMeher Baba, \nto a shastri (Sanskrit scholar), \nApril, May or June 1960, \nGuruprasad, Poona, Da p52 \nHowever far man may fling himself into outer space, even if he were to succeed in reaching \nthe furthermost object in the universe, man will not change. Wherever he goes, he will \nremain what he is. It is when man travels within himself that he experiences a \nmetamorphosis of his self. It is this journeying that matters, for the infinite treasure, God, is \nwithin man, and not to be found anywhere outside of himself. \n1963, HM p396 \nThe journey between the third and the fourth planes is very difficult. At this stage the \nconnection between the pilgrim and the Perfect Master is so very delicate that it may be \nsaid to be linked with only a hair. Thus neither of them can afford to create a strain or too \ngreat a resistance, lest the connection snap. \n6 June 1963, \nHM p446 \nThe fourth plane is called the threshold of the abode of God. If a man on the fourth plane \ntries to harass one on the fifth plane (a wali) with his powers, then the wali on the fifth \nplane seeks the help of the Avatar (Rasool), but not of a Qutub (Perfect Master). Thus he is \nprotected directly by the Avatar from the pranks of the fourth plane man, and the latter's \npowers are curbed. Very rarely one of the fourth plane becomes arrogant to a Qutub. If at all \nthere is any mischief or arrogance displayed, the Qutub sternly deals with such a person, \nand he eventually surrenders to the Qutub. The Qutub then raises him to the fifth plane of \nconsciousness at once.... \nIf a man on the fourth plane misuses his powers, and if the Qutub is a jamali, he does not \nbring the fourth-planer to the stone consciousness, but brings him down only to a gross-\nconscious human being. But if the Qutub is of a jalali trait, then he will bring about his fall \nright to the stone-consciousness. The Avatar never contacts the man on the fourth plane, for \nin that case the fourth-planer will automatically lose all his powers. But if the one on the \nfourth plane approaches a Qutub, he accepts him and raises him to the fifth plane of \nconsciousness. \n5 June 1963, \nHM p445-446 \nFor more on the spiritual Path, see 'Discourses' and 'God Speaks.' \nThe Path Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved. Email mehersthan at gmail.com \nPerfection 1 \nPerfection 1 \nTHE PATH \nBook Two \nThe spiritual Path runs from the physical world to the Beyond state of God. It traverses the \nSubtle and Mental worlds, and ends in the realisation of divinity. Those who take this path \nare called Rahrav (pilgrims of the Path). The Path begins in the Gross or physical world, \ngoes through six planes of higher consciousness, and ends in the seventh plane, the plane of \nGod-realisation. These planes are not outside us or above us, but are within us. Ordinarily it \ntakes many lives of effort to reach the goal, the permanent, conscious realisation of divinity. \nBesides human beings, the inner planes are home to Angels and Archangels. Angels and \nArchangels are unembodied souls. Unlike human beings, they have not gone through \nevolution of consciousness. They never took the forms of stone, metal, plant, insect, reptile, \nfish, bird or animal. They do eventually take human form, only once,  in order to realise God. \nTo attain conscious union with God, the soul must incarnate in human form. \nThe first three planes of higher consciousness are in the Subtle World. The fourth plane is at \nthe juncture of the Subtle and Mental Worlds. The fifth and sixth planes are in the Mental \nWorld. The seventh plane is the plane of union with God. Those on the seventh plane are \ncalled  God-realised souls or Perfect Ones. The seventh plane is the only plane that is eternal \nand permanent. When a person becomes one with God, and everyone eventually does, he or \nshe enjoys infinite bliss forever. One's individuality does not disappear, but becomes \ninfinite. \nIn the very beginning, the soul descends without consciousness from the undifferentiated \nbeing of God. The soul is actually God. But in its descent it takes on apparent separateness, \nand begins to imagine itself as something  other than God. The soul comes down through the \nMental and Subtle Worlds in the state of sound sleep. Those souls who become conscious in \nthe Mental world become Archangels. Those who become conscious in the Subtle world \nbecome Angels. \nMost souls continue to descend until the physical plane. They find themselves impelled to \nidentify with physical forms. This is the process of evolution of consciousness. The soul, \nwhich is actually God, imagines itself to be embodied and separate from other souls. The \nsoul experiences itself as gas, stone, metal, plant, insect, reptile, fish, bird, animal, and \neventually, human. It is a long-drawn out dream that takes millions of years to complete \nitself. On attaining the first human form, the process of reincarnation begins. The soul \nimagines that it lives again and again as a human being, experiencing every possible kind of \nhuman life. \nDriven by disillusionment with worldly life and intense love for God or Truth, the soul \nenters the spiritual Path. The soul, still imagining, ascends through the higher planes of \nconsciousness (which run through the Subtle and Mental Worlds), and in the end becomes \none with God. The God-realised soul has achieved the goal of life and fulfilled the entire \npurpose of creation. He or she has awakened from the dream of separate individuality, and \nrealises the divinity that has always pervaded everything. \nA few of the souls who realise God are brought back to consciousness of the creation. They \nare called Paramhansas and Jivanmuktas. They experience both the state of conscious \ndivinity and the illusion of creation. From among them, a very few become Perfect Masters. \nThe Perfect Masters (also known as Sadgurus or Qutubs) help free other souls still in \nbondage. They are responsible for the government of the creation. \nMeher Baba explained that there are 18,000 planets with human beings. But it is only on \nEarth that the Perfect Masters take birth. Earth is unique among planets in that it is \nnecessary to incarnate here to begin the spiritual Path and to realise God. At any one time \nthere are five Perfect Masters alive in human form on Earth. Each Perfect Master has a circle \nof 14 disciples whom he or she prepares for God-realisation. \nThe first person ever to realise God became the first Perfect Master. He is known as the \nAvatar (Buddha, Christ, Rasool), and is the master of all masters. The Avatar is the fusion of \nthe eternal Avataric consciousness, which pre-existed the creation, and the first God-\nrealised soul. Having taken on the responsibilty for every individual soul in creation, the \nAvatar incarnates again and again on earth. Every incarnation of the Avatar is brought \nabout by the five Perfect Masters of the time. Perfect Masters, unlike the Avatar, ordinarily \ndo not incarnate again. \nThe first incarnation of the Avatar is represented symbolically in Hinduism by Shiva and \nGanesh: Shiva as the first soul to realise God, and Ganesh as the same soul when he came \ndown for the first time as Avatar.  In Judaism, Christianity and Islam the first human being, \nwho became the first Avatar, is known as Adam. The better known incarnations of the \nAvatar are called major advents, and the less known ones minor advents. Meher Baba said, \napparently referring to minor advents, \"I often incarnate as an unknown Master.\" The \nAvatar has a circle of 122 disciples he prepares for God-realisation. \nThere are three types of Perfect Master: kwaja, qalandar and ghaus. The khwaja tends to \nstay in one place. The qalandar generally goes naked, and wanders from one place to \nanother. The ghaus separates his arms and legs from the the trunk of his physical body, later \nputting the body back together again. Perfect Masters have either jamali or jalali \ntemperament, or a combination of the two. Jamali Perfect Masters are mild or sweet-\ntempered. Jalali Perfect Masters are fiery-tempered, and sometimes beat their devotees. \nThough they may appear to be angry or violent, they are actually in an egoless state, and \nwhatever they do benefits others spiritually. \nMost people who realise God do not retain their physical bodies. They are Liberated, which \nmeans they realise God soon after physical death. These Liberated souls are called Muktas. \nSouls who realise God and keep their physical bodies are called Perfect Ones. The Perfect \nOnes are of four types: Majzoob, Paramhansa, Jivanmukta and Sadguru \nThe Majzoob (also called Brahmi Bhoot) has no consciousness of the three worlds or of his \nor her Gross, Subtle or Mental bodies. He or she experiences the infinite power, knowledge \nand bliss of God-realisation. Those who come into contact with a Majzoob are benefitted \nspiritually. \nThe Paramhansa continually experiences infinite power, knowledge and bliss, like the \nMajzoob, but in addition sometimes has consciousness of his or her bodies and of the three \nworlds. The Paramhansa is also called Majzoob-Salik or Salik-Majzoob. The Jivanmukta \n(also called Azad-e-Mutlaq) experiences infinite power, knowledge and bliss, and \nsimultaneously experiences his or her Gross, Subtle and Mental bodies and the Gross, Subtle \nand Mental worlds. A Jivanmukta, towards the end of his or her life, makes one soul \nspiritually perfect. Anyone who comes into contact with a Paramhansa or Jivanmukta is \nautomatically benefitted spiritually. \nThere are 56 Perfect Ones living on earth at any one time. Five of them are Sadgurus \n(Perfect Masters). The rest are Majzoobs, Paramhansas or Jivanmuktas. The last three  types \nare not Masters and have no spiritual duty (except, in the case of the Jivanmukta, to make \none soul Perfect). When the Avatar is incarnate, there are 57 Perfect Ones alive on earth (he \nis the 57th). During Avataric periods there may be several more Perfect Ones (in addition to \nthe 57) made Perfect by the Avatar, who are given special spiritual responsibilities. \nThe seventh plane is the plane of God-realisation. The Avatar, Perfect Masters, Perfect Ones \nand other God-realised souls have seventh-plane consciousness. Men and women on the \nspiritual Path are on the first six planes. They are either Salik-like pilgrims, yogis or masts. \nSalik-like pilgrims (also called saliks) are guided by a Perfect Master or the Avatar, and \nappear balanced rather than intoxicated. Yogis try to advance by their own efforts. \nSometimes they are guided by Perfect Masters or the Avatar. Masts are intoxicated or \noverpowered by the bliss they experience on the inner planes. Saliks on the first two planes \nare called initiate pilgrims. Those on the third and fourth planes are called advanced \npilgrims. Those on the fifth and sixth planes are known as adept pilgrims. \nAdept pilgrims can act as spiritual masters or guides. They themselves have not realised \nGod, but they can help others in their journey through the planes. They are conscious of the \nplane that they have reached (the fifth or sixth plane) and of all planes beneath, including \nthe Gross plane. Fifth plane masters are called Walis; sixth plane masters are called Pirs. \nAdept pilgrims should not be confused with those called saints by the organised religions. A \nsaint, as defined by Meher Baba, must be on the sixth plane of consciousness, and may or \nmay not be identified with any religion. A person on the sixth plane is made to realise God at \ndeath by a Perfect Master or the Avatar. \nA mast has become intoxicated or dazed by his love for God. He generally appears mentally \nunbalanced, but is actually spiritually advanced. Masts can be on any plane from the first \nthrough the sixth. A person who enters the spiritual Path without the guidance or help of a \nMaster may become a mast. A female mast is called a mastani. \nMasts often have some of the qualities of ghaus, khwaja or qalandar Perfect Masters, and are \ntherefore called ghaus-like, etc. They also have the jalali or jamali temperaments, or a \ncombination of the two. An ittefaqi is a mast who, without any love or longing, becomes \nsuddenly and accidentally intoxicated by divine love. Ittefaqi masts often wear iron rings on \ntheir arms and legs, and wander about late at night. A madarzad is a person who was born a \nmast, generally goes naked, and wanders continually day or night, rarely resting. A \nmajzoob-like mast is more or less merged in God, depending on the level of his \nadvancement. Masts occasionally serve as spiritual chargemen. The chargeman of a place is \nresponsible for the spiritual well-being of its inhabitants. Meher Baba identified certain \nmasts and salik-like pilgrims as being spiritual chargemen of the city or area where they \nlived. \nThose who traverse the spiritual Path by their own unaided efforts can take many lives to \nreach the goal. For those who have the good fortune to be guided by a Perfect Master, the \nprocess is much shorter. The followers of a Perfect Master or the Avatar are usually more or \nless veiled from the wonders of the higher planes. This protects them from the many \nenchantments and intoxications that slow down their progress or prevent it altogether. It \nalso keeps them from misusing the occult powers of the planes, which can be very binding, \nand even bring about a fall back to Gross consciousness. \nEditor \n\"There is a craving in every individual, no matter how unaware, to experience other states \nof consciousness, to understand the truth about God, the cosmos, the universe. In some \npeople this craving finds no rest. It becomes the driving force, unequalled in other areas, to \npursue the spiritual Path.\" \nSwami Sivananda Radha, \nRadha: Diary of a Woman's Search, p69 \n\"Imagine a palace with an infinite number of doors. In front of every door the visitor finds a \ntreasure. Satisfied, he feels no urge to continue. Yet at the end of the hallways, the king is \nwaiting to receive those among his subjects who think of him, rather than of the treasure.\" \nBaal Shem Tov \nSouls on Fire, by Elie Wiesel, p30 \n\"... Baba has used the following simile to describe the progress of an aspirant on the Path: \n\"He likens the Path to a house with three steps up to the front door, and these three steps \nare the first three planes. \n\"Thereafter, there is a fourth step up to the threshold at the front door. This threshold is the \nfourth plane, an awkward and dangerous place, where the pilgrim may lose his balance, and \nfall back down the first three steps if he is not careful. \n\"If, however, he crosses the threshold successfully, he enters the safe and level floor inside \nthe house, which is the fifth plane. He walks along this until he reaches the other end of the \nhouse, where there is a closed door. \n\"When he reaches this door at the back of the house, a centre of vision opens in his \nforehead, which is represented by the opening of the door; and he now sees God, and is on \nthe sixth plane. But as well as seeing God, he sees also an impossibly deep valley that \nseparates him in his present position from the splendor of God beyond, and he does not \nknow how to cross this great rift. \n\"It is here that he needs the help of a spiritually Perfect soul to take him across this last \ncolossal obstacle, which is greater than the sum of all his previous obstacles on the Path.\" \nWilliam Donkin, W p114-115 \nFor more about what it's like to traverse the planes, see TK p337-341 and LM4 p1495-1497. \n(Contrary to what it says in LM4, this outline for a screenplay was not written by Baba, but \nadapted by others from notes he gave.) \nFor more about the different kinds of spiritually advanced souls, see Wa p21-34. \nTHE FOURTH PLANE is the junction between the Subtle and Mental worlds. It is a \nparticularly dangerous stage on the spiritual Path because egoism is at its height while one \nhas access to incredible powers.

    "text": "PERFECTION \nMeher Baba \nOut of millions of souls, only one becomes Perfect. Perfection entails unimaginable \nhardships and sufferings. The Perfect man can bestow divine consciousness, the experience \nof infinity, upon anyone in the twinkling of an eye. The Perfect man bestows conscious \ndivinity, at the right moment, upon those who have an age-old connection with him. \nTo clarify this: suppose a man has suddenly risen to wealth. After becoming rich, however \ngenerous he may be, he will not distribute his riches to every poor person in the world. He \nwill give it to the selected few who are closely connected with him. Further, suppose that \nthis wealthy man is driving in his car and passes a pauper lying beside the road. He will \neither leave him there, or stop and hand him some money. \nBut if he comes across a poor man and discovers him to be his long-lost brother, how will he \nreact then? Despite the importance of his errand and the inherent nature of his position \n(working to gain more wealth), he will stop the car, and without the poor man's asking, he \nwill take him in his car to his house, and keep him there in luxurious comfort. \nThe same is true in the spiritual Path. To acquire the gift of divine knowledge, a person must \nhave a close connection with a Perfect Master. \nJanuary 1922, \nMandwa, \nLM2 p337 \nThe key to the world is only one, but it is in the hands of the five Perfect Masters. \nFor example, a safe has only one key, and no other key can unlock it. The five Perfect \nMasters control the safe - the world. \nOne Master is the keeper of the key, without which the safe cannot be opened. The second \nguards the safe, which cannot be opened without his prior consent. The third is the one who \nalone has the authority to use the key to unlock the safe. The fourth is the one who has the \nright to distribute the riches in the safe. And the fifth Master is the one who has the power \nto authorise the distribution. \nThus, there is only one key to the world, equally shared among the five Masters. The five \nPerfect Masters, plus the 51 other God-realised souls (Majzoobs and Jivanmuktas) control \nthe key. The 51 are members of the parliament of the five Perfect Masters. 51 plus five \nequals 56. This number 56 never changes. \nIn this way the game of the world goes on and on. All this I am telling you is a secret. \n12 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p810 \nGood and bad thoughts, feelings, words and actions are all due to the working of the mind. If \nthe mind vanishes, one realises the highest self. \nJust as they are the givers of light, Sadgurus or Qutubs are also the givers of thoughts. Not \nonly can they predict certain actions, but they can tell what will happen years into the \nfuture, even before it is created in the mind of an individual. For they are one with the \nuniversal mind which gives light, thoughts and everything. \nHence, they not only predict, they also predestine. Things actually become divine will \naccording to the Perfect Masters' will or wish. \n10 December 1929, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1258 \nEvery God-realised personality is Perfect. However, those who come down and act as \nMasters - the Sadgurus and Avatar - come down with their minds universal, and use divine \npowers to work for others. There is a place, Vidnyan Bhumika, where the Masters work and \nrest. It is similar to a threshold in between two places, where they can manage works both \nfor the higher and lower worlds. One aspect is the preparation of souls from the lower \nworld and the deliverance of them to the higher world, eventually Realising them. The \nMasters come down with the special purpose of bringing ripe souls to the highest state. \nWhen the Perfect Masters come down with this duty to the world, and work every day with \nthe people of the world, they descend with universal mind. Through the universal mind, \nthey take upon themselves the sins (bad sanskaras) of the ripe souls, and thereby suffer \nthemselves. They experience bliss through the soul, and suffering through the mind. They \nenjoy the bliss through the soul, which is one with the Almighty, and bear the universal \nsuffering through their universal mind. \n15 December 1929, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1259 \nThere is always a struggle between the spirit and the flesh, and the soul witnesses the \nstruggle. If the spirit succumbs to the flesh easily, without protesting, then there is no hope. \nIf the spirit gives in after struggling, there is hope. But if the spirit wins over the flesh, \nvictory is eternal. Yet it is the struggle itself that gives Perfection. So let us struggle now. \n10 May 1937, \nNasik, \nLM6 p2177 \nto his Western followers at Nasik \nQ. For an aspirant to the Path in search of a Master, is there any infallible method of \nrecognising a Perfect Master? \nBaba: Spiritual attainment to the planes one may not satisfactorily allocate or discriminate. \nAll those from the first to the sixth plane come under the general category of advanced \nsouls, more or less. But when luckily one comes into contact with Perfection, there are \nunmistakable signs for a seeker of Truth who is patient and sincere. \nThere are three important factors that are characteristic of the state of Perfection. \nFirst, Perfection is not only oneness with God, but the continued and uninterrupted \nexperience of oneness in everything. A Perfect Master continuously, without any break, \nexperiences or realises his own self as the self in all. This inner experience objectively \nmanifests itself in the spontaneity of love that such a one feels or expresses towards all \ncreation. To him, nothing is attractive or repulsive; good, bad, saint, sinner, beauty, ugliness, \nwisdom, idiocy, health, disease, are all different modes and moods of his own manifestation. \nWhen embodied Perfection loves, fondles, feeds any living creature, it feels and enjoys as if \nit is loving, fondling and feeding its own self. In this state no vestige of otherness is left. \nThe second point is the undeniable atmosphere of bliss that Perfection radiates in its \nimmediate vicinity, and which a visitor cannot help feeling or noticing. A Perfect Master not \nonly enjoys infinite bliss, but also experiences universal suffering. The poignancy of \nsuffering, however, is nullified and subdued by the overwhelming joy or feeling of bliss. \nHence Perfection outwardly always appears blissfully calm and unperturbed in the face of \nevery kind of pain, persecution and penury. \nThe third most outstanding characteristic of Perfection is its power to adapt itself to any \nlevel or strata of humanity. It is as nonchalant on a throne as it is obviously indifferent and \nundisturbed in a gutter. It is impecunious with the poor, extravagant with the rich, lordly \nwith kings, wise with the learned, and naively simple and innocent with the illiterate and \nignorant. \nJust as a Master of Arts delivers or teaches English in a different way to a beginner than to \nan undergraduate, similarly, a Perfect Master adapts himself to the level of the one whom he \nwants to uplift spiritually. Each one according to his need, and each one according to his \naptitude, is the perennial plan of personified Perfection. \nbefore May 1939, \nTr p189-190, \nalso MJ May 1939. \nAnother version: GS p262 \npenury = poverty ; impecunious = poor \nQ. Why does a Master fall ill and make use of medicine? \nBaba: The West differs from the East in its ideal of Perfection. The West believes Perfection \nto signify the possession and use of psychic powers. \nA yogi can do all the juggling by using psychic powers. He can abstain from food, go without \nsleep, leave the body at will, or stop breathing, etc. Spiritually considered, a simple, human, \ngood man who works in the world selflessly for others is much better, and stands higher, \nthan many yogis with all their powers of performing miracles, which are nothing but \njuggling, without any spiritual importance at all. Because whatever a yogi does is for his \nown individual self, and hence he is not selfless. He overcomes one illusion by creating \nanother illusion, which differs fundamentally from the teaching and work of a Perfect \nMaster. \nA Perfect Master, who has to take upon himself the burdens of the world to absorb them, \nmust necessarily have physical reactions, and consequently must suffer physically like an \nordinary human being. \nKrishna, Muhammad and Jesus were Perfect. By submitting themselves to the law of action \nand reaction, they established that law, and were selflessly and willingly subject to it. But in \nspite of subjecting themselves to this law, they stand above the law. They could in a second \nhave cured themselves or rid themselves from action and reaction. \nPerfect Masters absorb the dual effect of the universal illusion by taking humanity out of the \nillusion, through liberating mankind from the bonds of action and reaction. The Perfect \nMaster absorbs, in his true existence, duality, in order to sublimate it. \nRamakrishna had cancer, and he could in one instant have cured it with his spiritual \npowers. Jesus several times fainted on the cross, which he could have avoided but it was a \nnecessary demonstration for the good of humanity. Baba has abstained from fish, eggs and \nmeat, not for his benefit, but to create and impress on humanity an example which later, \nwhen he speaks, will become an established law. \n31 October 1937, \nCannes, France, \nGl Aug. 1970 p15-16 \nalso LA p215-216, and LM6 p2232 \nThere are 56 Perfect Ones in the world at all times. They are always one in consciousness. \nThey are always different in function. \nFor the most part, they live and work apart from and unknown to the general public. But \nfive, who act in a sense as a directing body, always work in public, and attain to public \nprominence and importance. They are known as Sadgurus or Perfect Masters. \nIn Avataric periods, the Avatar, as a supreme Sadguru, takes his place as the head of this \nbody, and of the spiritual hierarchy as a whole. \n1938, India, Di v1 p3 \nJust as everything in the domain of duality is based on degrees, so also is perfection based \non degrees when concerned with duality. Good and bad, virtue and vice, strength and \nweakness are all based on degrees when considered in relation to duality. Bad and good, \nvice and virtue, weakness and strength are all aspects of duality. But in reality, all are a \ndegree of oneness in duality. Evil is not evil, but the lowest degree of good. Similarly, \nweakness is not weakness, but the lowest degree of strength. \nPerfection also has degrees when compared with imperfection. Therefore one perfection in \nduality does not include every perfection. He who is perfect in science is probably not \nperfect in singing, and one perfect in singing will not be perfect in painting. So all these \nperfections are in the field of duality. Have you ever heard of perfect crimes? When murder \nis so cleverly perpetrated as not to leave a single clue behind, it is called a perfect crime. So \neven in crimes and so-called sins, there is perfection. \nBut spiritual Perfection is not in the domain of duality. All these relative perfections \nexplained come within the scope of intellect, but the perfection of spiritually Perfect souls is \nbeyond intellect. When one is Perfect spiritually, one experiences that nothing except God \nexists - he alone exists. To a Perfect being, everything that exists under the intellect and \nunder the domain of duality is illusion. So for the Perfect man, nothing exists but God. \nScience, art, music, weakness, murders are all dreams to him. His knowledge, his Perfection, \nis one indivisible existence. \nWhen this Perfect soul, for spiritual reasons, wants to use all his power and knowledge, he \ndoes it purely for the spiritual good of others. He then applies his universal mind in that \nsubject and knows all. To express everything outwardly is not necessary, but he does know \neverything. How? All languages have their root in the Mental world of thought, and are then \nexpressed orally. But he, the Perfect man, knows the mind of everyone. He knows the \npurport of every thought before it is uttered. So it is with everything, science, art, etc. If he \nwants, he can know it even before it is actually manifested. But he does that only when he \nthinks it necessary. \n... Perfection include all perfections, but there is no need to express them. Krishna was \nPerfect spiritually. That means he was perfect in everything, but he never showed his \nperfection materially because that material manifestation of perfection has no meaning, and \nis in the realm of illusion. He could have shown himself a perfect drunkard, a perfect sinner, \na perfect rogue, but that would have shocked the world. So he did not express that. He was a \nperfect drunkard, perfect sinner, perfect rogue, perfect in everything. He must have been, \nbecause he was, above all, perfect God. \n... When it is necessary, these Perfect souls express their Perfection in everything. For the \nspiritual benefit of the world, I can be perfect in any mode of life I have to adopt, not merely \nto show perfection, but for my work. Every aspect of life is contained in the highest state of \nPerfection: perfection in the world, perfection in yoga, perfection in attachment, perfection \nin detachment. \n1939, \nJabalpur, \nLM7 p2418 \nPerfection has both the human and divine qualities in full, and expresses itself in high and \nlow alike. A Perfect man has infinite love, inviolable spirituality, and greatest sense of \nhumor. He comes down to the level of the devotee, and yet is all the time the Master. \n1948? Meherazad? HM p28 \nAnother version: LM9 p3223 \nThe Perfect Ones, who retain normal consciousness and the body, even after realising the \nunchanging and absolute Truth, dwell eternally in divine love, which transcends all duality \nand all understanding. They enjoy abiding and unassailable peace, for they have arrived at \nthe final goal of all creation. \n1952, GM p198-199 \nThere are individual as well as national and universal problems which need the spiritual \nguidance of Perfect Masters and Avatars. Age after age these God-men guide humanity \nthrough their divine messages. Even after the absence of their physical bodies, these \nmessages are carried to the remotest corners of the world by their disciples, devotees and \nfollowers, who spread the beloved's word even at the cost of life. \nThe Avatars and Perfect Masters give their divine guidance and protection to the human \nrace and the world in their own unique and imperceptible ways, which are beyond the \ngrasp of the human intellect. \nThe Perfect Masters are the true saviours of mankind, and not of the selected few only. \nTheir love and grace alone sustain the universe. \nA disciple or devotee should never approach a Perfect Master with a mind clouded with \ndoubts and queries of why, when and wherefore. This can be a hindrance to his receptivity \nof the Master's grace, which is beyond the probings of the intellect. \nSo I say with divine authority, approach me with unfailing faith, love and devotion, and with \nthe longing to receive my divine love and grace. \nFebruary and March 1954, \nAndhra, \nMD p10-11 \nPerfection Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "PLANETS AND STARS \nMeher Baba \nRamjoo Abdulla: What are the stars? \nBaba: Stars, like planets, are spheres. But many of the planets are inhabited by human \nbeings. They resemble the Earth in culture, science, and in every way materially... but from \nthe spiritual point of view, our Earth is the most advanced, for the Perfect Masters are born \non this planet. \nThese other planets seem far off from one another, but in reality they are close. After \nRealisation, a man finds them issuing from himself in the millions, like tiny bubbles. He finds \nhimself to be the source of everything, the maker of all. \nAlthough the Gross spheres of the universes are different, the spiritual planes from \nbeginning to end are one. \n23 April 1924, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p619 \nThere are countless universes. Every star, though appearing to be a mere sparkling dot, is \nnot a single world, but a mighty sun with a solar system of evolving planets like our own. \nMeher Baba, \n17 May 1927, \nRahuri, \nLM3 p937 \nAs previously explained, there are an infinite number of worlds which have cooled down. \nAnd for each such world to cool down takes cycles and cycles -- imagine how long! But when \na man attains Realisation, and ascends to the seventh plane, he feels as if only a second has \npassed. That is, no time has actually passed during the numberless changes of forms, and \ndeaths and births of 84 lakhs -- eight million, four hundred thousand times. Now I know that \naccording to you, it accounts for billions of years, and there is no limit to accounting. But my \nexperience is that nothing has happened, and there is no time spent. \nThere are seven worlds, seven skies, seven suns, seven moons, seven planes and seven \nheavens. Why this figure seven? And sanskaras too are of seven colors. Why? Because in the \nvery beginning when Pran clashed with Akash, it created seven divisions. The explosive \nfriction between Pran and Akash created seven dazzling colors. \nEach individual human being is a universe unto himself. In the head there are seven \nopenings: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and one mouth. In the body there are seven \nparts: two arms, two legs, two openings (front and back), and one trunk. \nBut all this explaining of the universe and creation relates to the hair, and has nothing to do \nwith the head. So first try to get hold of the head, because out of it comes everything. (Baba \ndrew a man's head and hair.) The barber's work is to shave the head. And who is the barber \nin this case? Mahapralaya. For when it occurs, all the hairs -- universes -- on God's head are \nshaved off. It is said that the universes pour out of the Godhead. They are like God's hair. \nYour head may symbolise God, and your hair the universes. \nMeher Baba, \n23 December 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p997-998 \nThe sun that gives you light at present will burst after many crores (tens of millions) of \nyears. But another sun will take its place. The earth is getting cooler, and will eventually \nturn into a moon. But another planet, just like the present earth, will take its place. What has \nbeen in the past will be in the future. The processes of evolution and involution will go on \nforever. Ignorance and creation go hand in hand. \nMeher Baba, \n15 February 1929, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1140 \nWhat is there in the universe? Billions and billions of nebulae. Every nebula contains \nmillions of worlds, and ours is the Earth. \nWhat is there in the whole universe? It is gas in its 276 Subtle states. Before gas turns into \nthe first manifestation of the Gross, it evolves through 276 Subtle stages. None of the \nscientists knows about these 276 Subtle forms of gas before its first manifestation in the \nGross. Subtle gas very gradually turns into Gross form such as hydrogen, oxygen, etc. In the \nnebulae, in all heavenly bodies and in the planets there is evolution. All of evolution begins \nfrom the nebulae. The 276 Subtle stages begin from the beginning of the nebulae, which are \nat the source of Subtle energy (Pran) and Subtle space (Akash). \nMeher Baba, \n23 May 1934, \nMeherabad, \nLM5 p1872-1873 \nWe have said that each wave-bubble is a world in itself, and that there are numberless \nworlds. But for the purpose of illustration, we shall divide them into seven ranges: E, F, G, H, \nI, J, and K. In each of these ranges there are a number of worlds. \nOf these numberless Gross worlds, seven, each of which we have distinguished with a \nnumber, are nearer to the Creator, point D, than all the others. The three worlds A, B, C in \nthe central range, are to be regarded as only one world - the seventh, because they are so \nconnected with one another as to form one world with two branches. This diagram shows \nthe details at a glance: \nNow let us see what drop-bubbles (forms) each of the seven wave-bubbles (worlds) \ncontains. \nWorld number 1 contains stones. \nWorld number 2 contains stones and wind. \nWorld number 3 contains stones, wind and metals. \nWorld number 4 contains stones, wind, metals and water. \nWorld number 5 contains stones, wind, metals, water and vegetables. \nWorld number 6 contains stones, wind, metals, water, vegetables and animals. \nWorld number 7 contains stones, wind, metals, water,  vegetables, animals and human \nbeings. \nIt is only the seventh world (A, B, C) that has human beings besides other forms. Of the \nthree parts of this world A, B, C, our Earth is A. And the peculiarity of the seventh world is \nthat only in its A part, that is, on our Earth, a human being can realise God, owing to several \nreasons, the chief of which are: \n1. Our Earth is nearest to the Creator-point. \n2. Our Earth, and our Earth alone, is directly connected with Mental and Subtle worlds. \n3. It is only on our Earth that it is possible for human beings to possess intellect and love -- \nhead and heart -- in equal proportions. \nThe inhabitants of the C part of the seventh world are extremely intelligent -- far more \nintelligent than the human beings of our Earth; so much so that they are capable of \nexpressing their thoughts without Gross means. \nThe inhabitants of the B part are also more intelligent than the people of our world, but not \nso intelligent as those of C. \nBut though A -- our Earth -- is inferior from the standpoint of intellect to both B and C, it is \ncertainly superior to them from the standpoint of love and high emotions. Whereas the \ninhabitants of C have 100% intellect and 0% love, and those of B have 75% intelligence and \n25% love, the people of our Earth have, on an average, intelligence and love in equal \nproportions. When one, subduing intellect, gets 100% love, one realises God. \nWhen the atma leaves its highest form in C, it takes the highest form in B; and after giving it \nup in B, it incarnates in the highest form on our Earth. Therefore evolution, strictly \nspeaking, ends on our Earth, but the atma has to go on reincarnating in the human form  till \nit knows itself, i.e., till God is realised. \nNow, just as there is evolution of drop-bubbles, so also there is evolution and reaction of \nwave-bubbles. The Moon, which gives us light at night, was once an earth, just like our \nEarth; and there are a number of such cooled-down earths. Millions of years ago the \ncondition of our Earth was quite different from its present condition, and millions of years \nhence it will be just like the Moon. \nAbout the time our Earth turns into a moon, it will slip aside from its present position, just \nas the preceding one did; and its place will be filled by the B part of the seventh world. C will \ntake the place of B, and the world number six will take the place of C, and so on. \nNeedless to say that with the evolution of wave-bubbles (worlds), the evolution of drop-\nbubbles goes on simultaneously. In the world number six, at present there are no human \nbeings, but when it will take the place of C, souls, after giving up the highest animal form, \nwill incarnate in the human form with extraordinary intellect. Similarly, when B will take \nthe place of our Earth, its inhabitants will be filled with more love and imbued with higher \nemotions than they have at present. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1933, \nSi p21-23 \nWhat a vast illusion! Millions of worlds, tiny and huge ones. There are no Perfect Masters in \nthe other worlds. \n(Of) four of these worlds (that) are inhabited, one of them is like this Earth, but with \ndifferent types of forms - little forms. \nOnly this world, Earth, has Masters and Realised souls. \nThese worlds are very near, yet very far. When you understand the principle, it will be clear \nhow near everything is, and yet how far away. The other worlds are connected with this \nworld -- not actually, but they are. \nMeher Baba, \n1937? Aw 16:2 p52 \nQ. The astronomical phenomena, the eclipse of the Moon or the Sun, visibly stir the Hindu \nworld into great religious activity. Why is such an occurrence as an eclipse deemed \nopportune for a fresh flux of religious fervor, particularly in the matter of perfecting some \nmantras? \nBaba: The eclipse is purely an astronomical phenomenon and needs no explanation. There \nis, however, a germ of spiritual truth behind the grotesquely colorful imagery of gods and \ndemons, their squabbles and jealousies for the nectar of immortality, all ingeniously \nconcocted by the priest class to flabbergast the superstitious masses, and incidentally, to \nfleece them. \nThe spiritual aspect of the question is this: The whole universe, known and unknown, has \ncome out of a point in the microcosm which may be called the Creation Point. \nSimultaneously with this emanation, two processes come into play --  the evolution and the \nproduction. The differences between the two processes are rather significant, and must be \nclearly understood. The process of production is dependent on the process of evolution in \nsequence of causation, but not in sequence of time. Evolution depends on the Creation Point \nfor cause, but production is dependent on evolution. Evolution connotes spiritual progress, \nand production signifies material growth and change, organic or inorganic. \nIt is a scientifically acknowledged fact that the stellar regions, planets and stars do exert an \ninfluence on the life and activity of this planet, the Earth. And since this Earth of ours has the \nhighest evolved organic life, and the human happens to be the nearest to the spiritual plane, \nthe phenomenon of eclipse does indirectly affect the world spiritually. \nThe Rishis of old knew all too well the astronomical basis and the spiritual influence of such \na heavenly occurrence. Looking at the average mentality of the masses of their time, the \nRishis could do no better than issue cut-and-dried instructions as to prayers, penance and \nausterities, investing the whole affair with a religious importance, rather than give a \nrational and spiritual elucidation. In course of time the religious do's and don'ts of the wise \nRishis were very cleverly woven round by self-seeking priests, with a picturesque and awe-\ninspiring legend of the gods, demons, nectar, the Moon in travail, and its subsequent \nmoksha (freedom), for purposes all too patent to thinking minds. Such legendary \nsuperstitions persist and flourish with ignorance and illiteracy, but now people are \noutgrowing such childish beliefs. There is, however, no denying the fact that a few prayers \nand ordeals undergone with keen concentration, concurrently with the eclipse of the Sun or \nMoon, do result in great spiritual benefit to the individual concerned. \nbefore February 1939, \nQM p71-73 \nalso MJ 1:4 p76-77 and T p191-192 \nGod has ordained certain laws for the universe. They are followed by the Sun, Moon and \nstars, and everything that breathes. \nbefore August 1949, \nfrom notes dictated \nby Meher Baba, ST p57-60 \nIn the cosmogony of this universe, this Earth of ours has a special significance, being much \nnearer to the spiritual sphere. There are other worlds where much mental development is \nmarked. But spiritual progress really begins on this Earth. \nbefore August 1949, \nfrom notes dictated \nby Meher Baba, ST p116 \nGod is infinite reality, whereas cosmos is infinite illusion. But both are not infinite in the \nsame sense. God is one infinite, and illusion is infinite in numbers. God is infinite unity, and \nillusion infinite duality. Always God is. All along illusion is not. Illusion or no illusion, God \nremains beginningless and endless, while illusion has a beginning in illusion and it also ends \nin illusion. The infinite illusion includes an infinite number of suns, stars, moons, planets \nand worlds. The whole of the creation goes on evolving ad infinitum in illusion. \nMeher Baba, 26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, PL p3 \nAnother version: GM p326 \nGod is infinite, and his shadow is also infinite. The shadow of God is the infinite space that \naccommodates the infinite Gross sphere, which, with its occurrences of millions of \nuniverses, within and without the range of man's knowledge, is the creation that issued \nfrom the point of finiteness in the infinite existence that is God. \nIn these millions of universes are many systems with planets, some in gaseous states, some \nin states of solidification, some which are stone and metal, some which also have vegetation, \nsome which also have developed life forms such as worms, some also fish, some also birds, \nsome also animals, and a few also have human beings. \nThus it is that throughout the myriads of universes, there are planets on which the seven \nkingdoms of evolution are manifested, and the evolution of consciousness and forms is \ncompleted. But only on the planet Earth do human beings reincarnate and begin the \ninvolutionary Path to Self-realisation. Earth is the centre of this infinite Gross sphere of \nmillions of universes, inasmuch as it is the point to which all human-conscious souls must \nmigrate in order to begin the involutionary Path. \nMeher Baba, c.1960, \nIndia, EN p22 \nIn what is called space, numberless universes are continuously created, sustained and \ndestroyed. This procession of creation continues so long as God goes on imagining. And \nwhen God's imagination is suspended, as it is at moments in eternity when God withdraws \nhimself into his sound sleep state (just as a man's imagination ceases when he is in deep \nsleep), the creation is withdrawn and dissolved - Mahapralaya. \nCreation, preservation and dissolution are based on ignorance. In fact there is no such thing \nas creation, so preservation and dissolution never actually occur. The very cosmos has no \nfoundation save that of ignorance. Ignorance believes: the cosmos is a reality; birth, death, \nold age, wealth, honor are real. Knowledge knows: the cosmos is a dream; God alone is real. \nMeher Baba, c.1960, \nIndia, EN p87 \nAstronomers speak of time in terms of billions, trillions and aeons of years. Even these \nfigures are not adequate for their mathematical calculations, and they may be required to \ncoin new terms. If I were to try and explain in astronomical terms the beginning and end of \ntime, it would never depict the beginning and end of time in eternity. There is always an \n'ago' and there is always an 'after' to every point in time. The yesterdays of the past and the \ntomorrows of the future hinge on a point in time which is the now of the present moment in \neternity. \nIn a flight of imagination, imagining the beginning and the end of the now of the present \nmoment in eternity, one can at the most either add or subtract a measure of time. But this \nwould be nothing more than an adding or erasing of zeros. No amount of swing, even of \naeons of cycles in the sweep of time, can give an iota of concept of any beginning or end of \nthe now in eternity. \nMeher Baba, c.1960, \nIndia, EN p90 \n... There are infinitely vast fields in space which contain millions of universes with \ninnumerable suns. There are 18,000 worlds in creation with human habitation... \nScientists will someday have to come to agreement among themselves that there are \ninnumerable expanding and contracting, evolving and dissolving universes. Just as \naccording to varying conditions, a shadow is sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller, so it \nis with the galaxies. How can the mind imagine the limitlessness of creation? It cannot. Why \nnot? It is because we try to understand with the mind that which is beyond the mind. Mind \nand energy are absolutely nothing. Hence all these universes which the scientists find so \nastounding are also nothing. \nMeher Baba, \nc.1963? India, \nAw 9:4 p20, \nalso HM p394-395 \nThere are 18,000 worlds in creation which are inhabited, some by human beings with 100% \nintelligence, others with lesser and varying degrees of it. But the value of our Earth, where \nmind and heart balance, is inestimable. For it is here and here alone that one can go through \nthe process of involution and experience the Subtle and Mental spheres, here alone that \nGod-realisation can be attained. \nThus it is that souls (jivatmas) from other inhabited worlds finally take birth on this earth \nfor their emancipation, more so during the Avataric advent when the highest spiritual \nbenefit is gained, and most so when the Avataric manifestation is greatest. Hence the \npresent influx of population on earth is but the natural outcome of the rush of migration \nfrom other worlds, and the ones migrating from the worlds of highest intelligence are \nresponsible for carrying science to the peak it has reached today. \nAll this has been recurring since timeless ages in a neverending tide and ebb. Even this \nEarth expends itself in time, and another earth takes its place. Science will soon come to \nknow a little of what I have said. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1963? \nIndia, Mu p529 \nIvy Duce had visited Meher Baba in India, and on her way back to America she went to see \nan astrologer in  Delhi. The astrologer had a copy of the Bhrigu Samhita and the Arun \nSamhita, and read an ancient chart for Mrs. Duce's daughter Charmian. The chart covered \nCharmian's life in detail, with one statement for each year up into her eighties. \nIvy Duce wrote about the reading in a letter to Baba's sister Mani. \nBaba dictated the following to be included in Mani's reply to Ivy Duce: \n\"Baba says that you and Charmy, who have the rare good fortune of being among his close \nfold and deeply connected with him, are safe in his care, and should not let any astrological \npattern affect you or rattle or worry you. \n\"For although he does not radically change the course of individual karma (of those \nconnected with him), he does alleviate and modify it greatly when he thinks fit, and often \nhastens the working out of some karma whereby it is unwound in a much shorter time and \ngotten rid of. \n\"Whereas we think of time in the measure of years, he knows and sees to the untangling of \nthe karmic maze of many lifetimes. \n\"You should therefore give no countenance to mantras and astrological indications which \nmight apply to the general man who has not the good fortune of coming into the orbit of a \nPerfect Master's grace, and the much rarer opportunity of being within the circle of the \nAvatar. \n\"He does not mind your being interested in astrology as an interesting subject, but does not \nwant you in the least to be swayed by or involved in it, for your own good. \n\"Baba says that when he breaks his silence, you will understand everything - all your \nquestions will be answered in that understanding which embraces everything.\" \nlate 1962 or early 1963, \nHM p371-372 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "PRAYER \nMeher Baba \nThink of me every day for five minutes only, at any time of the day. Of course the best time \nwould be at five in the morning, when I remain almost everywhere. This little beginning of a \nmere five minutes will also be your first step on the spiritual Path. \nOnce you get interested in and attuned to the thought of God, you will have a constant urge \nto think of him for a certain period every day. It is sincere thought I want. No amount of \nprayer and chanting would be of any value if done as a ritual. \nThese five minutes of thought, meditation or concentration on God or the Master are a \nthousand times better than any prayer. God wants love, pure sincere love. He does not want \nto hear bombastic jaw-breaking words and shlokas from the shastras and passages from the \nAvesta. \nThe prayer books of all the religions, the Avesta of the Parsis, the Koran of the Muslims, the \nBible of the Christians, the Vedas of the Hindus, and all other religious books are long \ntreatises, and have nothing to do with the Truth. \nZarathustra taught that you must burn your heart in love of God, and the dasturs thereafter \nchanged the meaning of it and altered it to mean burning externally with sandalwood. The \nreligious dogmas and doctrines of the Kusti and other prayers in the Avesta all have been \nchanged from time to time. \nTake one name sincerely, lovingly, devotedly for a few minutes, without the thought of \nanything else, and that is worth more than hours of mechanical prayers. \nZarathustra had fourteen disciples to whom he gave God-realisation. Thereafter there was \nonly one God-realised disciple, and from him the knowledge and experience of God \nenlightened the community for 700 years. This knowledge came down from father to son. \nThe last true dastur was Azar Kaivan. Ever since, there have been false priests among the \nZoroastrians who have given their own versions of the Avesta. From that period until today \nthere has been no Realised saint among the Zoroastrians. Whatever religious books the \nZoroastrians have today are the works of those dasturs, and not of Zarathustra. However, to \nhis special fourteen disciples he gave real knowledge and experience, and to the world he \ngave a way of life. \nAs changes were made by the dasturs in the teachings of Zarathustra, so were similar \nchanges made by the priests in Christ's Bible and Muhammad's Koran. Sometimes these \nchanges came about inadvertently. Members of the Avatar's Circle would go out to different \nparts of the world and address masses of people. These lectures would be taken down by \nscribes, and later attributed to the Avesta, Bible, Koran and the Vedas. As time passed, the \nchanges became so complete that the original teachings were lost. \nI therefore once again repeat that instead of wasting your time on religious discussions, \nreading and listening to doctrines and dogmas of different religions, love God and think of \nGod. Meditation, concentration, and the creation of a feeling of love in the heart are the \nessence and substance of all religions. All else is illusion. \nThe alphabet is taught to the beginner with a view to making him master of the language. \nBut if the student merely learns the alphabet, and does not make an effort to form words, he \nhas learned nothing. Similarly, if an aspirant sticks to religious doctrines and dogmas, he \nwill never achieve his ultimate aim, realisation of the Truth. God and Truth are far above \nreligions. \n7 February 1928, \nMeherabad, \nto Abbas Ali \nand two dasturs (Parsi priests), \nBG p1-3 \nAnother version of the same explanation: \nZarathustra had fourteen disciples whom he Realised. There was one whom he Realised \nafter the fourteen. From him, the knowledge and experience of God descended from father \nto son for 700 years. After that, the last one, Dastur Azer Kaiwan, was false, and obtained the \nsacred seat and started collecting money. Those who followed him decreed as they thought. \nAfter them, until the present, there has been no realised person among the Zoroastrians. \nWhatever religious books (the Avesta) the Zoroastrians have now are the books of these \nfalse dasturs, and not of Zarathustra. Zarathustra taught and gave out gems of truth, gems of \nSufism, but they are not known to people. There were tremendous changes in the doctrines \nset down by Zarathustra made by the false dasturs. \nSo my best advice to you is to create love for God. Earn something in my contact. Otherwise, \nif you spend your time in discussions on religious doctrines and dogmas, it will take you \nnowhere toward Truth. It is all rigamarole, and will waste your precious time, which might \nbetter be used in thinking of God, meditating and creating love. Love is the sum and \nsubstance of all religions, and the only essential of all creeds. Leave the rigamarole alone. \nFor example, this alphabet board which I use may be given to a child to make him begin the \nABCs. But if he merely learns the alphabet without any efforts at proceeding further, he will \nlearn practically nothing. It is the same in religion. The shariat, doctrines and dogmas are \ngiven as a preliminary beginning, like the alphabet, to reach the ultimate aim of the \nrealisation of the Truth. After one learns to master the fundamentals, one advances. But if a \nperson merely sticks to religious ceremonies and rituals, and believes that religion is that \nalone, then he does not advance at all. God and Truth are far, far above shariat, doctrines \nand dogmas, ceremonies and rituals. \n7 February 1928, \nMeherabad, \nto two Parsi priests, \nLM3 p1020 \nIn Dhulia, a Brahmin priest lived in a room adjoining the Mandali's. Every morning he would \nget up early and loudly chant Hindu shlokas (verses) from the Shastras (scriptures). The \nMandali complained about him to Baba, and Baba explained: \n\"Everywhere in the world, in the name of prayer and worship, this sort of useless babbling \nis going on. Nothing is gained by it. It has no substance. Those who practice it derive nothing \nfrom it. Do they for a minute think that loud noises can bring results? For years on end it has \nbeen happening, and it will go on for years to come. For ages the Brahmins, the maulvis, the \ndasturs and the priests have been muttering hired prayers, and they are actually paid for \nsuch drivel. But not the slightest advantage has been gained by anyone as a result. \n\"The reason is that none of them does it sincerely or wholeheartedly. Their prayers are \nnothing more than the vocal cord's useless prattle, with no heart or feeling in it. Their \nmind's intellect, attention and thoughts wander here and there, and this idle mumbo jumbo \ngoes on. \n\"If it is done with a clear mind and with all sincerity, one's prayers reach straight to God. \nGod wants honesty and an open heart, not an outward show of meaningless chatter. \n\"From any corner of the world, heartfelt remembrance of God, even by the worst sinner, or \nthe most worthless and lowest person, immediately reaches God's ears. I am deaf to the \nsound of that Brahmin priest's chanting, though it is so near. I cannot hear it because it does \nnot touch me. It has no effect upon me. Any type of loud, insincere prayer from any quarter \nleaves us Masters unmoved, because it is only noise and carries no heart. Such dry, flat \nprayers, however loud or lengthy, or done over a long period of years, have no effect on us \nMasters. Instead, if anyone prays to God, to me, purely and honestly, from however far \naway, and however slowly or softly, I, as God, immediately hear it, and a connection is \nestablished. \n\"For example, take a long distance telephone station. Other telephones are connected to it, \nand the desired connection is given immediately upon dialing. In the same way, the Qutub is \nhumanity's central main station; and if one remembers him sincerely and wholeheartedly, \nfrom however long a distance, one's cry is heard, and the connection is made. There is no \nquestion of distance here. The Qutub is the center, the focal point equidistant from one and \nall in creation. And he, as this center, serves the purpose not only for this world or universe, \nbut for the three worlds and their various levels and planes. \n\"But how is it possible that all prayers are heard at one and the same time? How is it that \nthe prayers and calls of millions of persons bring immediate connection with the Qutub? \nThe answer is simple. What is a Qutub? The ruler of infinite and unlimited powers. To him \nthere is no question of one or twenty-one, a thousand or a hundred thousand, or millions \nand billions. Everyone is equal in his eyes. But your call should be from the innermost \ndepths of your heart. It will then reach his ears irrespective of distance or traffic on the line. \n\"All prayers and sounds are a mere show if they do not originate from the heart. If not, then \nsuch prayers, however loud and however long, are quite meaningless. But compared to this, \noffering hired prayers through Brahmins, dasturs, maulvis and priests is much worse. It is \nnothing short of sheer hypocrisy.\" \nQ. If it is done with a feeling of devotion, is it bad for a person who has no time to pray \nhimself to have it done through a medium? \nBaba: This is total foolishness and completely absurd. It is an excuse and a useless pretext. It \ndoes not hold water. It is an insult to one's common sense. Can prayer, worship or \nentreaties to God ever be hired? It is beyond one's imagination. While still being lured by \nmaya, it is like throwing the burden of one's actions on the shoulders of others, and paying \nthem money to take him to God. It is a pretense for keeping oneself immersed in mayavic \npleasures. \nA person says, 'I have no time to pray.' Why not? Because one is unwilling to spare time for \nit. It is a meaningless excuse to cover up one's preoccupation with the world and lack of \ntime due to one's desire to remain involved in mayavic pursuits. The mind is entrapped in \nmaya, and does not want to be freed. And so, to achieve merit, a person offers hired prayers. \nCan this ever result in any meritorious action or virtue? \nIf you want to remember or offer worship to God, do it honestly and loyally with all your \nheart and mind. Even if you can only remember or pray to him a few minutes each day, do it \nsincerely. Compared to babbling for hours on end, a sincere prayer of two minutes has more \neffect. It immediately reaches God's ears. The reason is that God always listens to the voice \nof the heart. \n4 July 1929, \nDhulia, \nLM4 p1174-1175 \nIs God deaf? Where is the necessity of shouting his name so loud? It makes one's heart skip \na beat. But God does not listen to such bleating. He has an ear only for the voice of the heart, \nof which the world has no idea. \n17 April 1930, \nPanchgani? \nabout the repeated calling of \n'Allah' from a mosque early in the morning, \nLM4 p1306 \nPeople pray to me to solve their difficulties, saying that they love me. But there is a vast \ndifference between love and prayer. \nIn Persian to pray means to beg, to want, to desire something, even the blessings of God. But \nwhen a person really loves, he gives himself over to his beloved completely. This is true \nlove. In that there is no begging, no wanting, and no room for desires. Only the longing to \nunite with the beloved remains. \nLove means the renunciation of the self. Prayer means selfishness, no matter how high the \nprayer may be. So there is a vast difference between when one prays and when one loves. \nJuly 1931, \nKarachi, \nLM4 p1374 \nUpon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God. Humility is spiritually of \ngreater worth than devotion. It is easier to be devout than to be humble, but devotion in \nmany instances proves to be a stepping-stone to humility. \nTrue bhakti (worship or devotion) does not necessarily mean the observance of religious \nrites and the muttering of mantras or bhantras.* But it certainly means the continual \nrepetition of any one name of God, or the continuous thinking and remembrance of God. \nTo pray to God for material prosperity is not a prayer, but a farce. \nOn the day of Jarthoshtno-diso many Parsis fervently pray, 'May the soul of Zoroaster rest in \npeace.' Surely these Parsis are utterly ignorant of the spiritual position of their Prophet, or \nare impudent to the last degree. No greater insult can be hurled at Yezdan Zoroaster than by \noffering such a prayer. \nWorldly-minded priests, though they may mutter prayers throughout the day, and may \nperform this and that ceremony, can confer no spiritual benefits on anyone. Poison trees \nmay be watered with nectar, but they will not produce edible fruits. \nIntellectual disputations about God will not bring you any nearer to him, and may take you \nfarther away. But persistent, heartfelt prayers to him will lower the veil that now envelops \nyou in darkness. \nbefore 1933, \nSa p11-13, 22 \neach paragraph is a separate quote \n*A mantra is a sacred verse or formula, a prayer written in rhythmical form. A bhantra is the \nchanting aloud of a mantra. \nMan wants God, but is given stone, in the form of churches, temples, idols and images. They \nare now all corrupt. Considered once as places of worship, they have turned into pitiable \ncenters of business for their caretakers. The places of God's prayer, worship and love have \nchanged into centers of business. Thus are the names of God and religion besmeared, \nbringing ultimately to humanity natural calamities such as plagues, pestilence, famines and \nother curses of nature with untold miseries on humanity in their wake. So, it is for this that \nthe teaching of the Avatars and Sadgurus caution one not to give importance to such places \nand forms of worship. Their work is to diminish and destroy all these piles of stone which \nkeep humanity away from God, rather than drawing it closer. \n1 April 1938, \nPanchgani, \nLM7 p2277 \nThe first thing every morning is to say a sincere prayer from you to God to make you \nunderstand him and his will: 'God, make me understand you and your will.' \n15 May 1943, \nMeherabad, \nto 125 men devotees to be said daily for one month, \nLM8 p2875 \nThe sigh within the prayer is the same in the heart of the Christian, the Muhammadan, the \nJew. They are indivisibly longing for the same God. \nGl May 1974 p7 \nIt is better not to worship if your heart is not in it. Any prayer made mechanically in a spirit \nof show or ceremony is all a farce. It results in greater bindings through one's pretense to \npurity. \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p42 \nThere are many religions, temples, and many religious practices and prayers, which you \nyourself may know, and the people following them. But God appears indifferent to those \nprayers or does not hear them, for this reason: that they are not of the heart. \nThe prayer God hears is the prayer of the heart, that raising of the heart, that suffering of the \nheart, that is what God pays attention to. And so it does not matter, and certainly it is \nfoolish, to rely upon the usual religious practices and ritual. What matters is your heart, the \nprayer that arises from your heart. That is the prayer that Baba hears, that God hears. \nJesus Christ said this exactly when he said, 'When you pray, close the door, pray in secret.' \nSo pray from the heart, even if you are with a thousand people... \nPeople know it all by heart, but they don't grasp it, or God would hear... Pray from the heart \nby giving yourselves. Just saying the words or being still, unless you are giving yourself, is \nuseless. It is the prayer of the heart, the giving of your heart that counts. Those prayers are \nanswered. \nJuly 1956, \nLondon, \nAw 4:2 p 14-15 \nGod forgives sins in the sense that he does not eternally damn anyone for his sins. He keeps \nthe door of redemption eternally open. \nThrough repeated sincere prayers, it is possible to effect an exit from the otherwise \ninexorable working out of the law of karma. The forgiveness asked from God evokes from \nhim his inscrutable grace, which alone can give new direction to the inexorable karmic \ndetermination. \n1956? Be p37-38 \nThe Masters have sometimes followed external disciplines, including prayers, and have set \nan example of humility and readiness to learn from others... No teachers have been content \nwith merely external disciplines. Through their teachings as well as example, they have \noften set forth prayer as the inner approach to God and divinity. \nWhat constitutes the essence of prayer? Many prayers to God are current among the lovers \nof God, arising as they do from diverse cultural contexts. Some of the prayers invariably \ncontain an element of asking something from God, either material or spiritual.  In fact, God \nis so merciful and bountiful that even without their asking, he always gives much more than \nhis lovers can receive. He knows their real needs more deeply than they do. Therefore the \nelement of asking something from God is superfluous. It often mars the inner love and \nworship which a prayer tries to express. \nThe ideal prayer to the Lord is nothing more than spontaneous praise of his being. You \npraise him, not in the spirit of bargain, but in the spirit of self-forgetful appreciation of what \nhe really is. You praise him because he is praiseworthy. Your praise is a spontaneous \nappreciative response to his true being as infinite light, infinite power and infinite bliss. \nIt is futile to attempt a standard prayer, and hold it up as an ideal for all people of all times.  \nThe glory of the Almighty transcends all human understanding and defies all verbal \ndescriptions. Eternally fresh and self-renewing in its unlimited amplitude, it never fades.  \nNor is it ever confined within the limits of the best of hymns. All hymns and prayers reach \nout towards the eternal truth of Godhead, only to merge those who utter them in silent and \nunending adoration. \nIf by ideal prayer to the Lord is meant a set formula, any search for it is a wild goose chase. \nAll prayers ultimately initiate the soul into an ever-deepening silence of sweet adoration. \nAnd all formulae are dissolved and assimilated into the integral and direct appreciative \nperception of divine truth. That which seeks to reach towards the immeasurable, itself \nbecomes incapable of being measured by any set standards. The ritualistic and repetitive \nexpressions of prayer do not and cannot do justice to the innermost essence of prayer, \nwhich is adoring love for the eternal beloved. To attempt to standardise prayer is to mar its \nintrinsic beauty. \nIf you pray with a motive to do good to someone, your prayer may actually bring about good \nboth to him and to yourself. Some people pray for the spiritual benefit of those who have \ndone them some wrong. There also, they are helping others spiritually. But all prayers with \na motive fall short of the ideal prayer, which is without motive. In the entire spiritual \npanorama of the universe, nothing is more sublime than a spontaneous prayer. It gushes out \nof the human heart filled with appreciative joy. It is self-expression of the freed spirit, \nwithout any actuation of a motive. In its highest form, prayer leaves no room for the illusory \ndiarchy of the lover and the beloved. It is a return to one's own being. \n1956? Be p73-76 \nGod does not listen to the language of the tongue and its japa, mantras, devotional songs and \nso on. He does not listen to the language of the mind and its routine meditations, \nconcentrations and thoughts about God. He listens to the language of the heart and its \nmessage of love, which needs no ceremony or show, only silent devotion for the beloved. \nIS p109 \nGod is not fooled by any outward show. He is completely deaf to ceremonial prayers and \nringing of church bells and chanting of mantras. He is never taken in by such superficial \nveneer, never ensnared by such blandishments. Love alone can move him, love alone can \nconquer him. Without that, nothing is to any avail. \n1963? India, IS p79",

    "text": "ENTERING INTO THE REALITIES OF THE INNER LIFE \nENTERING INTO THE REALITIES OF THE INNER LIFE \nThe value and the limitations of external conformity \nThough God-realisation is the ultimate destiny of all persons, there are very few who have \nthe necessary preparation for the fulfillment of that glorious destiny. The mind of the \nworldly-minded is darkened by the thick layer of accumulated sanskaras, and these \nsanskaras must be considerably weakened if the aspirant is even to enter the Path. The \nusual method to gradually dissipate the heaps of sanskaras is to follow, as strictly as \npossible, the external code of religious rituals and ceremonies. This stage of external \nconformity to religious injunctions or traditions is known as the pursuit of shariat or karma-\nkanda. It covers actions like the offering of daily prayers, the visiting of holy places, the \nperformance of duties prescribed by scriptures, and the observance of well-established \nrules of the ethical codes generally accepted by the moral consciousness of the times. The \nstage of external conformity is, in its own way, useful as a spiritual discipline, but it is by no \nmeans free from evil effects, for it not only tends to make a man dry, rigid and mechanical, \nbut it often nourishes some kind of subtle egotism. However, most persons are attached to \nthe life of external conformity because they find it to be the easiest way of placating their \nuneasy consciences. \nPassing on to the realities of the inner life \nThe individual often spends several lives in gathering the lessons of external conformity. \nBut there always comes a time when he gets tired of the stage of external conformity and \ngets more interested in the realities of the inner life. When the worldly man takes to this \nhigher kind of search, he might be said to have become an aspirant.  Like the insect, which \nthrough metamorphosis passes on to the next stage of existence, the aspirant transcends \nthe phase of external conformity (shariat or karma-kanda) and enters upon the path of \nspiritual emancipation (tariquat  or moksha-marga). In this higher phase, the aspirant is no \nlonger satisfied by external conformity with certain rules, but he wants to acquire those \nqualifications which would make his inner life spiritually beautiful. \nThe limitations of conventions \nFrom the point of view of the realities of the inner life, the life of external conformity, which \nsatisfies the requirements of conventions and formality, may often be spiritually barren; \nand a life which deviates from such rigid conformity may often be spiritually rich. In seeking \nconformity with established conventions and formality, a man is almost always prone to slip \ninto a life of false or illusory values,  rather than a life which is based upon true and lasting \nvalues. What is conventionally recognised may not always be spiritually sound. On the \ncontrary, many conventions express and embody illusory values, since they have come into \nexistence as a result of the working of average minds which are spiritually ignorant. Illusory \nvalues are mostly conventional because they grow into that matrix of mentality which is \nmost common. This does not mean the conventions necessarily embody nothing but illusory \nvalues. \nFreedom from conventions must be based upon critical thought \nSometimes people stick to unconventional things for no other reason than that they are out \nof the way. The unusual nature of their pursuits or interests enables them to feel their \nseparateness and difference from others and take delight in it. The unconventional things \nalso often derive their interest merely from their novelty in contrast with the conventional \nthings. The illusory values of usual things become insipid through familiarity, and the mind \nthen has a tendency to transfer the illusion of value to those things which are not usual, \ninstead of trying to discover true and lasting values. Transcending the stage of external \nconformity does not imply a mere mechanical and thoughtless change from conventionality \nto unconventionality. Such change would be essentially of the nature of reaction, and it can \nin no way contribute towards a life of freedom and truth. The freedom from conventionality \nwhich appears in the life of the   aspirant is due, not to any uncritical reaction, but is due to \nthe exercise of  critical thought. Those who would transcend the stage of external \nconformity and enter into the high life of inner realities must develop the capacity to \ndistinguish between the false and the true values, irrespective of conventionality or \nunconventionality. \nDiscrimination between the true and the false \nThe rise from shariat or karma-kanda to tariquat or moksha-marga is therefore not to be \ninterpreted as being merely a departure from external conformity. It is not a change from \nconventionality to idiosyncrasy, from the usual to the unusual; but it is a change from a life \nof thoughtless acceptance of established traditions to a mode of being which is based upon \nthoughtful appreciation of the difference between the important and the unimportant. It is a \nchange from the state of implicit ignorance to a state of critical thoughtfulness. At the stage \nof mere external conformity, the spiritual ignorance of man is often so complete that he \ndoes not even realise that he is ignorant. But when the person is being awakened and enters \nthe Path, he begins by realising the need for true Light. And at the initial stages, the effort \ntowards this Light takes the form of intellectual discrimination between the lasting and the \ntransitory, the true and the false, the real and the unreal, the important and the \nunimportant. \nThe bankruptcy of barren beliefs \nFor the spiritual aspirant, however, it is not enough to have merely intellectual \ndiscrimination between the false and the true. Though intellectual discrimination is \nundoubtedly the very basis of all further preparation, it yields its fruit only when the newly \nperceived values are brought into relation with practical life. From the point of view of \nspirituality, what matters is not theory  but practice. The ideas, beliefs, opinions, views or \ndoctrines which a person might intellectually hold constitute a superficial layer of human \npersonality. Very often a person believes in one thing and does exactly the opposite. The \nbankruptcy of barren beliefs is all the more pitiable, because the person who feeds upon \nthem often suffers from the delusion that he is spiritually advanced, when in truth, he has \nnot even begun spiritual life. \nThe salient points of dogmas and creeds \nSometimes even a wrong view, which is held with some fervor, may indirectly invite an \nexperience which opens out the gates to the spiritual life. Even at the stage of shariat or \nkarma-kanda, allegiance to religions is not infrequently a source of inspiration for many \nselfless and noble acts, because, though these dogmas or creeds are blindly accepted, they \nare often held with a fervour and enthusiasm which supply the dynamic element to the \nideology which has been accepted by the person for the moment. Dogmas and creeds, as \ncompared with barren views and doctrines, have the distinct advantage of being embraced, \nnot only by the intellect, but also by the heart. They cover and affect a wider part of \npersonality than purely theoretical opinions. \nThe cause of the evil results of dogmas and creeds \nBut dogmas and creeds are at least as much a source of evil as of good, because in them the \nguiding vision, which is at the helm of individual life, is itself clouded owing to degeneration \nor suspension of critical thinking. If allegiance to creeds and dogmas has sometimes done \nsome good to the individual or to the community to which he belongs, it has more often \ndone untold harm to the individual or to others. Though the mind and the heart are both \ninvolved in the allegiance to dogmas and creeds, the mind as well as the heart are both \nfunctioning under the serious handicap of suspension of thought. Hence dogmas and creeds \ndo not contribute to unmixed good. \nThe need for putting theory into practice \nIn one sense, when a person gives up uncritically accepted dogmas and creeds in favor of \nthose views and doctrines to which he has devoted thought, there is a certain amount of \nadvance, in so far as his mind has now begun to think and critically examine its beliefs. But \nvery often the newly held beliefs are seen to lack the fervor and enthusiasm which used to \ncharacterise allegiance to dogmas and creeds. If these newly held beliefs lack motive power, \nthey belong only to the superficial aspect of life, and they hang loosely upon the person, like \nan overcoat. The mind has been emancipated from the domination of uncultured \nemotionality; but this is often achieved by sacrificing the cooperation of the heart. If the \nresults of critical thought are to be spiritually fruitful, they must again invade and recapture \nthe region of the heart, so as to enlist its cooperative function. In other words, the ideas \nwhich have been accepted after critical examination must again be released into active life if \nthey are to yield their full benefit. In the process of being used in practical life, they often \nthemselves undergo healthy transformation and become more sound.  And what is more, \nthey are now interwoven with the very fabric of life, and are no longer merely ornamental. \nCritical and creative thinking promotes the balance of mind and heart \nThe transition from external conformity (shariat or karma-kanda) to the life of inner \nrealities (tariquat or moksha-marga) involves two steps: \n1. freeing the mind from the inertia of uncritical acceptance based upon blind imitation, and \nstirring it to critical thinking, and \n2. bringing the results of critical and discriminative thinking into practical life. \nIn order to be spiritually fruitful, thinking must be not only critical but creative. Critical and \ncreative thinking leads to spiritual preparation, by cultivating and fostering those qualities \nwhich contribute toward the perfection and balancing of the mind and the heart, and the \nrelease of unfettered Divine Life. \nBack to top",

    "text": "SOME DIVINE QUALITIES \nSOME DIVINE QUALITIES \nThe qualities necessary for the spiritual life are interdependent upon each other \nIf the inner life of man is to be harmonious and enlightened, he has to develop and express \nmany divine qualities while he is engaged in his daily duties. Each quality, by itself, may not \nseem to be extremely important; but it is not right to consider it apart from its necessary \nrelation with other important qualities. In the spiritual life, all these qualities implement \nand support each other; and their interconnection is so vital that not one of them can be \ncompletely ignored without detriment to many other essential qualities. So, considered in \nits true function, each of these divine qualities turns out to be absolutely indispensable for a \ncomplete life. \nPatience and persistence \nEvery man is a rightful heir to the Truth. But he who would inherit it must be spiritually \nprepared for it, and this spiritual preparation sometimes takes several lives of patient and \npersistent effort. Therefore, one of the first requirements of the aspirant is that he should \ncombine unfailing enthusiasm with unyielding patience. Once a man is determined to \nrealise the Truth, he finds that his path is beset with many difficulties, and there are very \nfew who persist with steady courage till the very end. It is easy to give up effort when one is \nconfronted with obstacles. This might be illustrated by a story of a man from  Poona. He \nonce read a spiritual book which impressed him so deeply that he felt like renouncing \neverything. He left  Poona, went to a jungle near the city, and sitting under a tree he began \nto repeat God's name with a rosary in his hand. He kept doing this all day, in spite of much \ninconvenience and dwindling enthusiasm. After the sun set, he heard from all sides the cries \nof frightening animals. And though these cries grew louder and louder in the gathering \ndarkness of the night, he persisted in his determination. But when he saw through the \ndarkness a huge bear coming towards him, he fled to save his life, and ran for seven miles at \ntop speed until he fell unconscious in a shop in  Poona. As he became conscious again, he \nrelated his adventure to those who had gathered around him, much to their amusement. But \nthat finished his mood for renunciation. \nAccepting the world as it is \nSpiritual effort demands not only physical endurance and courage, but also unshrinking \nforbearance and unassailable moral courage. The world is caught up in  maya and is \naddicted to false values. Therefore, the ways of the world run counter to the standards \nwhich the aspirant has set for himself. If he runs away from the world, that does not help \nhim. He will again have to come back to the world to develop that quality which would \nenable him to face and accept the world as it is. Very often his path lies through the world, \nwhich he has to serve in spite of not liking its way. If the aspirant is to love and serve the \nworld, which does not understand him, or even is intolerant to him, he must develop infinite \nforbearance. \nForbearance \nAs the aspirant advances on the Path, he acquires, through his contact with the Master, an \nincreasingly deeper understanding of true love. And this makes him painfully sensitive to \nthose impacts from outside which not only do not taste of love, but actually bring him into \ncontact with cold contempt, cynical callousness, agonising apathy and unabating hatred. All \nthese impacts try his forbearance to the uttermost. Even the worldly man suffers in the \nworld, which he occasionally finds indifferent or hostile. But he is thick-skinned and his \nsuffering is less acute, because he does not expect anything very much better from human \nnature, and thinks that these things are inevitable and incurable. But the aspirant who has \ntasted of a deeper love knows the hidden possibilities in every soul; and his suffering is very \nacute because he feels the gulf between that which is and that which might have been, if \nonly the world had even faintly appreciated the love which he has begun to understand and \ncherish. \nMoral courage and confidence \nThe task of forbearance would be easy if the aspirant could get reconciled to the ways of the \nworld and accept them without challenge. But, having seen the higher, it becomes an \nimperative duty of the aspirant to stand by it, even if the whole world opposes him. Loyalty \nto the higher truth of his own perception demands unshakable moral courage, and \nreadiness to face the criticism, scorn and even hatred of those who have not yet begun to \nopen out to the truth. And although in this uneven struggle, he does get unfailing help from \nthe Masters and other aspirants, he has to  develop the capacity to fight for the truth single-\nhanded, without relying upon external help all the time. This supreme moral courage can \nonly come with supreme confidence in oneself and the Master. To love the world and serve \nit in the ways of the Masters is no game of the weak and the faint-hearted. \nFreedom from worry \nMoral courage and self-confidence should be accompanied by freedom from worry.  There \nare very few things in the mind which eat up as much energy as worry; and it is one of the \nmost difficult things in the world not to worry about anything. Worry is experienced when \nthings go wrong. But in relation to past happenings, it is idle merely to wish that they might \nhave been otherwise. The frozen past is what it is, and no amount of worrying is going to \nmake it other than what it has been. But the limited ego-mind identifies itself with its past, \ngets entangled with it, and keeps alive the pangs of frustrated desires. So worry continues to \ngrow in the mental life of man until the ego-mind is burdened by the past. Worry is also \nexperienced in relation to the future when this future is expected to be disagreeable in some \nway. And in this case, it seeks to justify itself as a necessary accompaniment of the attempt \nto prepare for coping with the anticipated situations. But things can never be helped merely \nby worrying. Besides, many of the things which are anticipated never turn up, or if they turn \nup at all, they turn out to be much more  acceptable than they were expected to be. Worry is \nthe product of feverish imagination working under the stimulation of desires. It is living \nthrough sufferings which are mostly our own creation. Worry has never done anyone any \ngood;  and it is very much worse than mere dissipation of psychic energy, for it substantially \ncurtails the joy and fullness of life. \nCheerfulness, enthusiasm and equipoise \nAmong the many things which the aspirant needs to cultivate, there are few which are as \nimportant as cheerfulness, enthusiasm and equipoise. And these are rendered impossible \nunless he succeeds in cutting out worry from his life. When the mind is gloomy, depressed \nor disturbed, its action is chaotic and binding. Hence arises the supreme need of \nmaintaining cheerfulness, enthusiasm and equipoise under all circumstances. All these are \nrendered impossible unless the aspirant succeeds in cutting out worry from his life. But \nworry is a necessary resultant of attachment to the past or to the anticipated future, and it \nalways persists in some form or other until the mind is completely detached from \neverything. \nControl and dispassion are the conditions of one-pointedness \nThe difficulties in the Path can be overcome only if the aspirant has one-pointedness. If the \npsychic energies are dissipated in worldly pursuits, the progress which he makes is very \nslow. But one-pointedness implies dispassion concerning all the allurements of the \nphenomenal world. The mind must have turned away from all temptations, and complete \ncontrol should have been established over the senses. Thus, control and dispassion are both \nnecessary for being able to attain one-pointedness in respect of the search for true \nunderstanding. \nGuidance from the Master \nThe supreme condition of sure and steady progress on the Path is the benefit of guidance \nfrom the Master. The Master gives just that guidance and help which is necessary according \nto the immediate needs of the aspirant. All that the Master expects is that the aspirant will \ntry his best for spiritual advancement. He does not expect immediate transformation of \nconsciousness, except where the ground is previously ready. Time is an important factor in \nspiritual advancement, as it is in all material endeavors. When the Master has given a \nspiritual push to the aspirant, he waits till the help thus given is completely assimilated by \nhim. An overdose of spirituality always has an unhealthy reaction, particularly when it is \ninopportune. The Master, therefore, carefully selects the moment when his intervention is \nassured of maximum results; and having intervened, he waits with infinite patience till the \naspirant really needs further help. \nBack to top",

    "text": "READINESS TO SERVE \nREADINESS TO SERVE \nReadiness to serve is according to individual aptitude and ability \nThe aspirant has to be always in readiness to serve the cause of humanity. He need not \napply himself to any type of work irrespective of his capacity. He has to select that portion \nof work which he is qualified to do by virtue of his individual aptitude and abilities. But \nwhatever service he can render by virtue of his capacity, he renders even when the \ncircumstances are most trying. \nNo insistence upon the claims of the limited 'I' \nThe ordeals through which he may have to pass are many, but his determination to serve \nwhenever possible must remain unshaken. He is not in any way attached to the idea of \nservice, in the sense of maximum results being secured through  himself alone. If there is \nany service which needs to be rendered, he is willing to render it with any amount of \nsacrifice; but he never is bound by the false idea, 'I alone should have the credit of doing it.' \nIf the privilege of rendering the service falls to the lot of someone else, he is not envious. If \nhe were to seek for himself opportunities for rendering service, it would be a form of \nselfishness. In the service which really counts in the spiritual life, there can be no thought of \nthe self at all. There should be no necessity felt of having something for oneself, or of being \nthe one who can give something to others. The self in all its forms has to be entirely out of \nthe picture. Service should spring out of the spontaneity of freedom, if and when it is \nnecessary, and it has to come in the cooperative spirit, in which there is no insistence upon \nthe claims of the limited 'I'. \nFreedom from the opposites of great and small things \nIf the aspirant is completely detached from all works and their results, he becomes free \nfrom the vitiating opposites of the great things and small things. The worldly-minded feel \ntheir separative existence through achievements. Therefore, they have a natural tendency to \njudge their achievements in terms of tangible quantities. They grasp at great things and \navoid the little things. But from the spiritual  point  of view, the so-called little things are \noften seen to be as important as the so-called great things. The aspirant has no motive to \neschew the one and seek the other. Therefore he attends to little things with as much zest as \nto great things. \nThe domination of conventions restricts the scope of service \nIn the spiritual life, the little things matter as much as the great things. But the conventions \nof the world usually fail to recognise this simple truth. By following the conventionally \naccepted ideas, the scope of possible service to fellow beings gets artificially restricted to \nthose things which are conventionally regarded as important; and many things which really \nare of vital importance to life come to be neglected, with the result that life is spiritually \nimpoverished. \nAccepted values determine the fields of service \nThus, in a society which is dominated by merely material conceptions of life, service is \ninterpreted in terms of supplying bread or clothes, or other physical amenities of existence. \nIn a society which values intellect, service is interpreted in terms of spreading learning in \ndifferent forms. In a society which has developed a taste for beauty, service is interpreted in \nterms of organising the production and distribution of works of art. In a society which is \nresponsive to the ineffable values of the heart, service is interpreted in terms of \nconstructing those channels which will facilitate the culture and expression of the heart. \nAnd in a society which is alive to the supreme importance of the spirit, service is interpreted \nin terms of imparting spiritual understanding. Of these different types of service, the service \nwhich is concerned with spiritual understanding is the highest, because spiritual \nunderstanding includes the right perspective to all human problems, and promotes a \nsolution of them all. \nTwo kinds of service \nBut if there is no spiritual understanding, the desire for rendering service to others is \nharnessed by limited conceptions. Service is of two kinds: it consists in adding to the lives of \nothers those things which are really worthwhile, or it consists in removing from the lives of \nothers those handicaps which prevent them from having things which are worthwhile. And \nif our ideas of things which are worthwhile are narrow, the scope of possible service also \nbecomes correspondingly narrow. \nLittle things that matter \nThe scope of service is not completely exhausted by great gestures like giving big donations \nto public institutions. They also serve who express their love in little things. A word that \ngives courage to a drooping heart, or a smile that brings hope and cheer in gloom, have as \nmuch claim to be regarded as service as onerous sacrifices and heroic self-denials. A glance \nwhich wipes out bitterness from the heart and sets it throbbing with a new love is also \nservice, although there may be no thought of service in it. When taken by themselves, all \nthese things seem to be small, but life is made up of many such small things. And if these \nsmall things are ignored, life will be not only unbeautiful but unspiritual. \nElement of error in the estimates of the world \nJust as the worldly-minded have a tendency to judge positive contributions in terms of \nmagnitude, they also make a similar mistake in judging obstacles, handicaps and adversities. \nThus, for most persons, the adversity of another must assume colossal forms if it is to \ndeserve notice. It is characteristic of the worldly-minded that they give more importance to \nthings that take shape in external and tangible ways than to things which are silent \nelements in the inner life. Devastating war is, for example, considered to be a greater \ncalamity than lingering lives filled with bitter hatred;  though from the purely spiritual point \nof view, lives filled with bitter hatred are not in any way less evil than devastating war. War \nassumes so much importance because of the many visual instances of cruelty. But hatred is \nequally unbeautiful, even when it does not  materialise itself in outward actions. In the same \nway, epidemics, injuries, and the sufferings of the deathbed invite more attention from the \nworldly-minded than the agonies of the heart which is heavy with the burden of \nunquenchable desire. \nThe field of service is life as a whole \nBut for the aspirant who is eager to serve without any desire for recognition and credit, \neverything that thwarts or perverts the release of full life is worthy of attention, irrespective \nof whether it is great or small according to the usual estimates of the world. Just as the \nbuilding up or the collapse of empires has a place in the flow of universal life, the fleeting \nmoments of sadness or sweetness have also their own place in it. The importance of the one \nshould not be measured in terms of the other, and the claims of the one should not be \nignored against the claims of the other. The aspirant looks at life as an integral whole, \nwithout allowing any parts to monopolise his attention at the cost of other parts. \nService which springs from love ensures harmony with co-workers \nEven when the aspirant is rendering a service which is selfless, he keeps constant guard \nupon his mind. The aspirant must be humble, honest and sincere. The service which he \nrenders must not be for the sake of mere show, and it should be an outcome of true love. If \nthe aspirant is inspired by love, his love shall enable him to be in entire harmony with other \nworkers without being jealous. If there is not complete harmony amongst the workers, the \nservice which is rendered falls short of the spiritual ideal. Further, if the aspirant renders \nthe outward service without the spirit of love, he is acting from a sense of duty, as in many \nworldly institutions where there are paid workers. In the institutions of the world, people \nwork for pay. At best, it is a cold sense of duty which prompts them to be efficient. Their \nwork cannot have the inward beauty of work which is spontaneously done out of love. \nThe importance of contact with the Master \nThe aspirant can best assimilate the lessons of true service, if he has the good fortune to be \nin contact with the Master. The Master teaches not through preaching, but through example. \nAnd when the Master is seen in his capacity of rendering service to humanity, the aspirant is \nquick to catch that spirit because of his love for the Master. Contact with the Master is also \nhelpful in imbibing the spirit of cooperation, which the aspirants cultivate easily because of \ntheir common love for the Master. They serve because the Master wants it. They do the \nMaster's work, not their own.  And they do it, not of their own accord, but because they have \nbeen entrusted with that work by the Master. Therefore, they are all free from any ideas of \nindividualistic claims, rights or privileges, being keen only about the Master's work, ready to \nserve his cause to the best of their ability when they are called upon to do so, and equally \nready to hand over that work to another aspirant if he can do it better. \nService without fuss \nIn cooperation of this type, the aspirants are, in a way, serving each other, because the \nMaster's work is accepted by them all as their own. And in being useful to a co-aspirant for \ndoing the Master's work, the aspirant is rendering a service to him as much as to the Master. \nBut in such service there can be no bossing, because the aspirant is always conscious that it \nis the Master's work, which he has accepted as his own, that he is doing. He further knows \nthat, as aspirants, they are all equal. And it is easy for him to cultivate the habit of serving in \nthe spirit of utter humility. If service makes him proud, he might as well not have served. \nOne of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without \nmaking a fuss about it, and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of \nspirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility. \nThe ideal of service \nWhen the Master serves others, he does so, not because he is attached to the work, but in \norder to help, and also to set for his disciples the example of selfless service. And while \nserving others, he sees himself in them, and experiences having served himself. In his \nunwaning blissful feeling of oneness, the Master knows himself to be at once the Lord of all \nand the servant of all. He therefore exemplifies an ideal of service in which there is no \nenslavement, either of he who receives service, or of he who renders it. The aspirant can \nspeedily realise the ideal of true service if he has before him the example of the Master. But \nthe spiritual preparation of the aspirant can never be said to be complete unless he has \nlearned the art of rendering service which gives not boredom, but joy; which brings not \nenslavement, but freedom; which does not set claims and counter-claims, but springs from \nthe spontaneity of free give and take; which is free from the burden of personal want; and \nwhich is sustained by the sense of ever-renewed fulfillment. \nBack to top",

    "text": "FAITH \nFAITH \nThe value of faith and its forms \nOne of the most important qualifications for the aspirant is faith. Of faith there are three \nkinds: 1. faith in oneself, 2. faith in the Master, and 3. faith in life. Faith is so indispensable to \nlife, that unless it is present in some degree, life itself is impossible. It is because of faith that \ncooperative and social life becomes possible. It is faith in each other that facilitates a free \ngive and take of love, a free sharing of work and its results. When life is burdened with \nunjustified fear of each other, it gets cramped and restricted. \nFaith in each other and its essential counterpart \nChildren have a natural faith in their elders. They look to them for protection and help \ninstinctively, without requiring any introductory letters. This quality of trusting others \npersists in later life, unless the person receives a rude shock by being deceived or exploited \nby others for their self-interest. So, though faith is natural to man, it grows and flourishes in \na society where men are reliable and honest and worthy of faith, and it fades in a hostile \nenvironment. Faith in each other becomes complete and steady when it finds its \ncounterpart in those qualities which invite and confirm faith. Being worthy of faith which \nothers place in us, and having faith in others, are two complementary virtues. They are the \ncondition of an unhampered flow and development of individual and collective life. \nThe importance of faith in oneself \nUnqualified and implicit faith in each other belongs to the world of ideals. In actual practice \nit exists only in some special cases. Though it is very much to be desired, it cannot come \nunless the world is peopled with persons who deserve unlimited faith;  and this condition \nrequires a perfect development of the qualities of being reliable, steadfast and invariably \nhelpful. But these qualities, which foster mutual faith, remain undeveloped unless one has \nsupreme faith in oneself. If a man has no faith in himself, he cannot develop those qualities \nwhich invite and foster faith from others. The confidence that you can, under all sorts of \ntrying circumstances, remain loyal to your own perception of the best, is the very \nfoundation of the superstructure of a reliable character. \nA secure basis for self-confidence \nBut unshakeable faith in oneself is as rare as implicit faith in some other person. Few have \ndeveloped it to the degree which ensures effective and constructive control of oneself. In \nmost persons, faith in oneself is always being challenged and undone by the constant \nexperience of one's own frailties and failings, which often prove to be unyielding, even when \nthe man knows what is right. The self-confidence, which is thus in perpetual danger of being \nshattered, can be securely established only when the man has in front of him the vision of \nthe living example of perfection and has faith in it. \nFaith in the Master \nFaith in the Master becomes all-important because it nourishes and sustains faith in oneself \nand faith in life, in the very teeth of setbacks and failures, handicaps and difficulties, \nlimitations and failings. Life as man knows it in  himself or in most of his fellow men may be \nnarrow, twisted and perverse. But life as he sees it in the Master is unlimited, pure and \nuntainted. In the Master, man sees his own ideal as realised. The Master is what his own \ndeeper self would rather be. He sees in the Master the reflection of the best in him, which is \nyet to be, but which he will surely one day attain. Faith in the Master, therefore, becomes the \nchief motive power for realising the divinity which is latent in man. \nFaith and critical reasoning \nTrue faith is grounded in the deeper experiences of the spirit and the unerring deliverances \nof purified intuition. It is not to be regarded as the antithesis of critical reason, but as the \nunfailing guide of critical reason. When critical reason is implemented by a deep and living \nfaith based on pure intuition, its functioning becomes creative, fruitful and significant \ninstead of barren, ineffective and meaningless. On the other hand, many forms of naive \ncredulity cannot be broken through except by the fearless and free working of critical \nreason. However, it remains true that critical reason can touch and inform only those forms \nof faith which are not based upon pure intuition. True faith, grounded on pure intuition, \nalways remains an imperative which cannot be ultimately reduced to the conclusions of \nratiocinative intellect. It is not derived from the limited intellect, but is more fundamental \nand primary, with the result that it cannot be silenced by any intellectual acrobatics. But \nthis does not mean that faith at any stage  need be blind, in the sense that it is not allowed to \nbe examined by critical intellect. True faith is a form of sight and not of blindness. It need \nnot be afraid of the free functioning of critical reason. \nAn analysis of credulity and doubt \nThe right of testing the Master through critical reasoning has always been conceded to the \ndisciples. But if after testing and being satisfied about the perfection of the Master, the \ndisciple shows any wavering of faith, it is a result of a deplorable deficiency in his sincerity \nof approach and integrity of purpose. Just as there are many cases of uncritical and \nundeserved credulity placed in the claimants for spiritual wisdom, there are many cases of \nan unjustified wavering of faith in spite of a convincing basis for faith in one's own \nexperience. And just as uncritical credulity is ultimately the result of an unconscious \noperation of many worldly wants, unjustified wavering of faith is also due to the \nunconscious operation of desires which run contrary to the effective manifestation of a \nrationalised faith. In the first case, wish is the father of unwarranted belief; and in the \nsecond case, wish is the father of unwarranted doubt. \nWavering of faith is often due to the unconscious operation of cravings \nCravings have a tendency to pervert the functioning of critical reasoning. And an \nunwavering faith, which is grounded in pure intuition, can come only to a mind which is free \nfrom the pressure of diverse wants. True faith is, therefore, a matter of gradual growth. It \ngrows in proportion to the success which the disciple attains in freeing his consciousness \nfrom diverse cravings. \nBeliefs and opinions \nFaith must be carefully distinguished from a mere intellectual belief or opinion. When a \nperson has a good opinion about someone, he is said to have a certain kind of faith in him. \nBut this kind  of opinion does not have that spiritual potency which belongs to a living faith \nin the Master. The beliefs and opinions which a person has often constitute a very \nsuperficial layer of the human psyche. They do not have any integral relationship with the \ndeeper psychic forces. They remain in one region of the mind without bringing about any \nradical changes in the core of personality, which determines the attitude to life. People hold \nsuch beliefs just as they wear clothes. In times of emergency, they show  the tendency to \nchange their clothes to suit their immediate purposes. In such cases, beliefs are \nunconsciously determined by other purposes; the purposes are not consciously determined \nby beliefs. \nLiving faith is creatively dynamic \nLiving faith, on the other hand, has the most vital and integral relation with all the deeper \nforces and purposes of the psyche. It is not held  superficially, nor does it hang, like merely \nintellectual beliefs, in the periphery of consciousness. On the contrary, living faith becomes \na powerful factor that reconstructs the entire psyche; it is creatively dynamic. It enlivens \nevery thought, illumines every feeling, recasts every purpose. Such living faith in the Master \nbecomes, for the disciple, a supreme source of inspiration and unassailable self-confidence. \nAnd it expresses itself primarily through the spirit of active reliance upon the Master, and \nnot merely through some opinion about him. Living faith is not a sort of certificate given by \nthe disciple to the Master. It is an active attitude of confidence in the Master, expressing \nitself not only through implicit and trustful expectation of help from the Master, but also \nthrough the spirit of self-surrender and dedication. \nLiving faith is grounded in experience \nSuch fruitful and living faith in the Master is always born of some deep experience which \nthe Master imparts to the deserving disciple. It is fundamentally different from the beliefs \nwhich people have either through uncritical acceptance or superficial thinking. Mere \nintellectual beliefs have, for the most part, very little spiritual importance. The Master, \ntherefore, is utterly unconcerned with whether the disciple believes in him or in someone \nelse. And he is equally unconcerned with whether the disciple, at any moment, does or does \nnot believe in him. If, in some fortunate cases, the Master, through his benign intervention, \nwins for himself the living faith of the disciple (as distinguished from mere belief), it is \nbecause he knows that the disciple will be helped through it. \nTesting the disciple \nJust as the disciple is testing the Master in respect of his capacity to guide him, the Master, \nin his turn, is testing the disciple in respect of his integrity of purpose. The Master is \nunconcerned about whether the disciple doubts him or has faith in him. What he tests is \nwhether the disciple is or is not sincere and wholehearted in his spiritual search and \npursuit. The Master is not at all interested in giving proof of his own divinity to the disciple, \nexcept when he feels that any such proof is likely to be unfailingly useful and unavoidably \nnecessary for the spiritual benefit of one who has surrendered himself to him. \nsource: Discourses by Meher Baba, \nvolume 5 \n(1943?) p45-65 \nBack to top \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "RELIGION \nMeher Baba \nBasically, religion is one. There is only one religion. The source from which this religion has \ncome is continuous, despite the lapses of ages. Yet several branches have come forth from \nthis one religion, like the Zoroastrian, Hindu, Buddhist, Christian and Muhammadan \nreligions. There have been many others... \nFor example, water from the tap fills the different pots for different purposes, like washing, \ncooking, drinking, etc. The source, the tap, is the same. Similarly, the Hindu or Muslim \nreligion, or the Zoroastrian or Buddhist or Christian religion, springs from the same source, \nwhich is God. \n1919?  LM1 p254 \nThe light of Zarathustra has been extinguished by his followers themselves. His was the \nhighest form of Sufism. If Zarathustra were to be born again in this material world, he would \nfind it difficult to recognise his own religious tenets, as practiced by the present day \nfollowers of his creed. The same is true of all religions. The Muslim mullas, Hindu pundits, \nZoroastrian dastoors and Christian priests have mutilated the original religion for their own \nselfish ends. \nOctober 1922, \nBombay, \nLM2 p431 \nThe real meaning of religion is to know God, to see God, and to be one with God. Everything \nelse about religion is an exercise in rites and rituals. \n8 June 1926, \nArangaon, \nLM3 p809 \nAbout the American Christian Mission and the Salvation Army, both of which tried to \nconvert Indian Hindus and Muslims to Christianity: \nWhy all this? Why mislead people into leaving their religions? Is religion the Truth as well \nas the way to the Truth? Truth has nothing to do with religion. Truth is far away and far \nbeyond the tenets and principles of religion. Truth is naked and unrestrained, and can only \nbe experienced by cutting loose maya's limbs, lust anger and greed. \nMuslims say that experience can only be gained through the Islamic religion, arguing for \ncircumcision and other rituals. How ludicrous. Do any of you know why Muslims practice \ncircumcision? Muhammad told them to cut down and annihilate their minds, meaning to cut \nthrough maya and cut away their sanskaras. This means keeping one's own mind under \ncontrol and away from worldly thoughts. By failing to understand the true meaning of the \nProphet's teaching, some theologians concentrate upon the custom of circumcising children, \na custom which people, without thinking, accepted and started to follow. \nThe same is true in every religion, the Parsis and their kusti, the Christians and their \nbaptism. What is the meaning of all these practices in the name of religion? If it is not a sin \nto make others doubtful of their own religion, it is surely a great weakness. What is the \nadvantage in expanding a religion until its followers number in the millions? This is the Kali \nYuga. See the horror done in the cause of religion. Look at the massacres born out of \nignorance and cruelty occurring between Hindus and Muslims, all for the sake of religion. At \nthe same time, many false prophets have appeared, and hypocrisy is rampant. People now \nwant religious doctrines to suit their own ideas of life, and the crafty leaders who observe \nall this and fulfill their wishes find thousands of followers. \nSo I have been telling you, control your mind, live a pure and clean life, discard desires, and \nfollow a Master who is God-realised. Then alone you will be safe. Following a Master does \nnot mean giving up your religion. You should renounce the mind. \n22 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p817-818 \nTo me all religions are equal, and the wrangle over religious dogmas and practises are mere \nexercises in futility. \nStill, a person should have respect for the religious faith of another, and it should not be \nhampered under any circumstance. \nOn the contrary, all traditionalists or strong believers in their faith and religious practises \nshould be accorded all facilities. It is desirable to encourage them. \n23 July 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p829 \nThe human mind is such that it makes a person adhere to his thoughts, to the extent that \neven in the field of religion, each man thinks his is the best. The Parsis consider their \nreligion the highest, and call most other people doorvand - untouchables. The Muslims are \nalso in the same category. To them only Islam and Muhammad are true, and all other people \nare kafirs - unbelievers. The Christians are no better. To them only Jesus Christ is the \nRedeemer, and all other people heathens. \n20 September 1926, \nMeherabad \nLM3 p845 \nThe Hindu and Muslim priests both speak against each other's religion. But do you know \nwhat religion is? Religion is a cage, and the people who follow it are all birds locked up \ninside. \nIt is meaningless to leave one's religion to adopt another. It is like going from one cage to \nanother. The wire binding the wings of the bird must be cut. \nEach person must make individual efforts to sever his own leash, for example, by \nrenunciation or being indifferent to food and drink. But above all, efforts should be made to \ncut the cord through love. Love God, for when the Sadguru comes he snaps the cord and \nfrees the bird. \nI am the Christ, and the world exists because of me. For me there is no time, space, cause, \neffect, duality, or anything that exists besides me. There is only unity. \n22 February 1927, Meherabad, LM3 p915 \nWho gave all these different religions? The Avatars. Why have they done so? To establish \nprinciples for people, and to bring people to the point where their faces are turned toward \nGod. Mohammad and Buddha each gave different precepts, according to the circumstances \nand mentality of the people of the time. \n4 December 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p990 \nZarathustra had fourteen disciples whom he Realised. There was one whom he Realised \nafter the fourteen. From him, the knowledge and experience of God descended from father \nto son for 700 years. \nAfter that, the last one, Dastur Azer Kaiwan, was false, and obtained the sacred seat and \nstarted collecting money. Those who followed him decreed as they thought. After them, \nuntil the present, there has been no realised person among the Zoroastrians. \nWhatever religious books (the Avesta) the Zoroastrians have now are the books of these \nfalse dasturs, and not of Zarathustra. Zarathustra taught and gave out gems of truth, gems of \nSufism, but they are not known to people. There were tremendous changes in the doctrines \nset down by Zarathustra made by the false dasturs. \nSo my best advice to you is to create love for God. Earn something in my contact. Otherwise, \nif you spend your time in discussions on religious doctrines and dogmas, it will take you \nnowhere toward Truth. It is all rigamarole, and will waste your precious time, which might \nbetter be used in thinking of God, meditating and creating love. Love is the sum and \nsubstance of all religions, and the only essential of all creeds. Leave the rigamarole alone. \nFor example, this alphabet board which I use may be given to a child to make him begin the \nABCs. But if he merely learns the alphabet without any efforts at proceeding further, he will \nlearn practically nothing. It is the same in religion. The shariat, doctrines and dogmas are \ngiven as a preliminary beginning, like the alphabet, to reach the ultimate aim of the \nrealisation of the Truth. After one learns to master the fundamentals, one advances. \nBut if a person merely sticks to religious ceremonies and rituals, and believes that religion is \nthat alone, then he does not advance at all. God and Truth are far, far above shariat, \ndoctrines and dogmas, ceremonies and rituals. \n7 February 1928, Meherabad, \nto two Parsi priests, \nLM3 p1020 \nThese days there is too much stress everywhere on religion. Religion is the root cause of all \nstrife, both internal and external, and is the cause of all wars in the world. \nOctober 1928, \nNasik, \nLM3 p1100 \nOn Christmas day, Baba's school for boys was closed, but there were no religious \nobservances. Meredith Starr came to visit Baba at noon, and Baba told him, \n\"On all four sides, in every corner of the globe, religious precepts and ceremonies prevail. \nWere we to follow the same old sham and show here, then what would be the difference \nbetween us and the world? \n\"Here, to obey me is the best religious act you can perform, and by doing so you will free \nyourself from all the bondages of the customs and rites of religions.\" \n25 December 1928, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1130 \nIn all religions, the beginning of opposition against the priest class is welcome, because at \npresent the priest class is the greatest obstacle in the path of spirituality. The rigid and \ndeep-rooted beliefs and prejudices of age-old customs, rites and rituals which the priests \nhave inherited and nourished in the name of religion are intolerable and the greatest \nimpediment. \nSo if the downfall of this junta is brought about, the firmly imbedded prejudices and rites \nwill be destroyed. Although there is the risk of people becoming indifferent to God and \nreligion, these can still be revived afterward, once these rotting prejudices are uprooted. \n3 April 1930, \nMeherabad? \nLM4 p1296 \nSo long as people will continue attending to the empty shows of customs and ceremonials, \nthey will fail to grasp the essence or substance of religion. \nThough creeds and theologies are many, religion is, strictly speaking, only one, and this one \nreligion includes in its essence sublime character, mental purity, love to God, and longing to \nrealise the Truth. \nIn order that this religion may be applicable to all, caste-class tyranny and priestcraft must \nbe eradicated root and branch. \nFebruary 1931, \nMs 3:3 p91 \nThe priest class proves to be an impediment in everything. If you gain independence, do this \nfirst: arrest all the purohits, dastoors and mullas.* Do not use violence, but deal with them \nfirmly. \nDeal with them vigorously, because it is an important, big work. And unless you send all the \npriests to Yeravda prison, they won't improve. On the contrary, they will become worse. \n8 September 1931, \nto Mahatma Gandhi, on board the ship \nRajputana en route from Port Said to Marseilles, LM4 p1397 \n*Hindu, Parsi and Muslim priests \nDesmond Tolhurst: I am a staunch Roman Catholic, and want to lead a life of rectitude. I feel \nat times I am doing wrong, and I am tempted. I repeat my mistakes time and time again. I \nam religious-minded, and want to remain devoted to God and the Church. \nBaba: Be religious, it is good. But eventually you will have to go beyond the shariat, the \ntraditional ritual of religion. \nTolhurst: Are there any true saints and holy priests in Christianity? \nBaba: There were saints, but the Christian priests are the same type as those priests in \nevery other religion throughout the world. Out of selfishness, priests create and propagate \ntheir own customs, tenets and practises, thereby crippling religion. All these rites, rituals \nand ceremonies are the dry husk of the corn. \nSeptember 1931, \nLondon, \nLM4 p1429 \nMay Davy: I have faith in Christ and also believe that there is no other Christ, and there will \nbe no other such being in the future. Jesus was the only one and will be the only Christ \nforever. Since Christianity is predominant in the West, it is superior in religion and spirit to \nthe East. \nBaba: To explain it all to you will take some time. But I will convince you that I have gained \nthe state of Christhood and that I am the Christ. \nMay Davy: Impossible. I don't believe you. I don't understand what you mean. \nBaba: Were I to explain it to you, you would understand everything. Truth is above religion. \nTruth is far, far beyond the intellect. It can only be reached by love. Christ attained that state \nof divine love. I am in the same state, and I have its experience. I am always in the Christ \nstate of everlasting bliss. \nSeptember 1931, \nLondon, \nLM4 p1440 \nAlthough spirituality is greater in  India, the pundits (priests) there have their say too much. \nNot only is love pushed aside, but even the search is ignored. Besides, on every road in  \nIndia we come across sadhus who boast about their way of life. And as you know, cheating \nis widespread there by the false gurus... \nI have been saying that no damage to religion is as great as that done by the priest class. \nHere, too, there are many priests and preachers. But the people who came to meet me are \ndevotional and loving, and it is a great pleasure for me to meet with them... \n2 October 1931, \nLondon, to Mahatma Gandhi, \nLM4 p1447 \nBaba: Love is the only real religion. People are now tired of theories, doctrines and \nprinciples. They want the real thing, which explanations can never give. They must feel \nTruth, see Truth and experience Truth. Only then can one find harmony with everything and \neveryone. Only then can one, though remaining in the world, not be of it. I am eternally \nhappy. I see my own self in everyone and everything. \nRobert Norwood: Do you preach any specific precepts, or do you belong to any particular \ncreed? \nBaba: None, absolutely. Religions, castes, sects, dogmas and rituals are all hindrances in the \npath of Truth. Truth is all-pervading and infinite. I do  not teach anything. I make the \nlearned forget. I have come, not to teach, but to awaken. \nNorwood: Is going to church of any help? \nBaba: Yes, to a certain extent. Not much, though. The church that advocates and nourishes \nsectarianism renders no help. All true churches, temples and mosques are for all. To attain \nthe Truth, no obstacle should be put in anyone's way, such as present-day religions and \ncults do. \nNorwood: Yes, it is true. At first I was active in a Christian church, but because I was in \nsearch of a religion of the heart, I left it. Now religion and sectarianism do not appeal to me. \nI have always been sure that there is something higher than religion. \nBaba: Exactly. I frequently repeat the same thing. I am preparing the way for people so that \nthey will be able to live a life of Truth. There is no religion higher than love. Love is the only \nway leading to Truth and God-realisation. Mind and intellect provide only superficial \nunderstanding. It is dry knowledge. One should try to see God and experience him. The first \nthing is reality, the second is unity. Love is truly a shortcut in the long path toward \nachieving God-realisation. It is the quickest way. \n24 November 1931, \nNew York, \nLM4 p1486-1488 \nNo spiritual Master brings religion into the world in the form which it eventually assumes. \nHis very presence is a blessing and radiates spirituality. He imparts it to others by personal \ncontact. \nThe so-called religions are an effort to commemorate the association with a great spiritual \nMaster, and to preserve his atmosphere and influence. \nIt is like an archeological department trying to preserve things which only resuscitate the \npast. The living spirit being absent, religions or organisations gradually lose their glamour. \nThe result is a mental revolt against the established order. Something more substantial and \npractical is required, which expresses the life of the spirit. \n19 May 1932, \nNew York, \nMe p84-85 \nMessage to reporters aboard the ship Bremen \nYou will not be saved by accepting any theological dogmas, or by regarding a Prophet who \nlived hundreds or thousands of years ago as the only God-incarnate, as the only genuine \nSaviour, as the last real messenger of God. If you want to be saved, conquer your mind, lead \na pure life, renounce low desires, and follow one who has realised God, and in whom you \nhave sound faith. \nMost of the so-called religious ceremonies performed by the Parsis, the Hindus, and \nfollowers of other creeds, are unnecessary and worthless. For these useless ceremonies it is \nthe avaricious and worldly priests who are responsible. Prophets, Sadgurus and saints are \nnot bound by them. \nWorldly-minded priests, though they may mutter prayers throughout the day, and may \nperform this and that ceremony, can confer no spiritual benefits on anyone. Poison trees \nmay be watered with nectar, but they will not produce edible fruits. \nThe so-called religious leaders who repeatedly quarrel over rites and dogmas can only lead \ntheir followers into the deep pit of ignorance. Only the blind will follow the blind. What light \ncan be thrown by him who is himself in the dark? What knowledge can he impart who has \nnot experienced Truth. \nThe priest whose principal motive is to serve himself, and not others, should be called a \nminister, not of God, but of his lower self. Disinterestedness and eagerness to serve others \nshould be the characteristics of a genuine priest, to whatever creed he may belong. He \nshould be like a river that does not drink its own water, but is useful to others, irrespective \nof their caste, creed and color. \nMany of the so-called Christian missionaries are the followers of Judas, not of Jesus. The \nobject of a true Christian missionary should be not merely to baptise the so-called pagans, \nbut to render unselfish service to others, regardless of their creed and color. \nTo change our outward religion for another is like going from one cage to another. Either \ncross the boundary of Shariat (outward forms of religions) and enter Tarikat (the spiritual \nPath) or remain within the cage of the creed of your birth. \nIn order to realise God, and to gain the original state from which everything emerged, we \nshould follow the creed that accords with our own conscience, and stick to that path which \nbest suits our spiritual tendency, our mental attitude, our physical aptitude, and our \nexternal surroundings and circumstances. \nbefore 1933, Sa p11-15 \neach paragraph is a separate quote \nDogmas, creeds, and conventional ideas of heaven and hell and of sin are perversions of \nTruth, and confuse and bewilder the mind. \nbefore 1933, QA p12-13 \nI very much appreciate this idea of coming together of the representatives of different \nfaiths, which, in fact are based but on one and the same principle - faith itself. \nThe medium, the surroundings and the settings may be different. It may be formed of \nimages or imagination. It may be based on the intellectual conviction, or an emotional \nimpression. Yet the central jewel of a faith is just the same. \nThere are no two kinds of faiths. Faith is the last thing to be labeled. The only question could \nbe of a strong faith or a weak faith. Some hold it to the point of forms and ceremonies only. \nAnd some, going beyond this, stick to the kernel, eschewing the crust, either believing in \nimpersonal infinite existence, or believing in one's own Master. So it is only a question of \ndegrees. \nUnless and until there is complete Realisation, which is the goal of all faiths, faith is faith \nafter all, call it blind or call it otherwise. \nOnce God is realised, there is no question of faith at all, just as there is no question of faith \nfor a man to believe that he is a man. Because one then, having transcended the boundaries \nof faith, feels oneself identified with the infinite, and finds the one self manifested \neverywhere. \nPlease convey my blessings to all. \n3 June 1933, Bombay? \nMessage to All Faiths Congress at Nasik \nBaba did not attend; his message was read out by Ramjoo Abdulla \nMe p7.  Another partial version: LM5 p1773 \nQ. I am happy to see you. \nBaba: Not nervous? Anything to ask or say? \nQ. I have doubts about you, and also cannot understand why Western religion calls the \nEastern confusing? \nBaba: And the Eastern people say the same about Western religion. Everyone thinks his \nown religion the best. This is ignorance. Jesus never meant that. What does religion mean? \nTo find God within. What did Jesus teach? To find him within, and not to carry on wars, as \nhis own followers have been doing. \nQ. How can we realise that? \nBaba: Through love, and helping others selflessly. It is very easy. If you think less of yourself, \nand more of others, it is so easy. No matter if you doubt me, or do not even believe in me. I \nwill help you. \nQ. I want to believe in you. \nBaba: But why? If what you want is within, you will find it only there. And my aim is to help \nyou find it, whether you follow me or not. \nQ. But it is difficult. \nBaba: I will help you, even if you don't want it. When the sun is high up and you feel hot, you \ncannot avoid it. It shines on you even if you don't want it. It is a question of going out of \nyourself to help others. This contact will help you greatly. My blessings. \n1934,  Zurich, Switzerland, \ninterview with the daughter of a clergyman, \nPM p239-240 \nQ. Is decent living enough for attaining a wider consciousness, or is any occult, spiritual or \nreligious training necessary? \nBaba: No general rule or process can be laid down for the attainment of the ultimate reality, \nor as you term it, the wider consciousness. Every individual has got to work out his own \nsalvation, and for that matter, he himself has got to create and choose the Path, which is \nmostly determined and expressed by the collective force and momentum of impressions \n(called sanskaras in Sanskrit) acquired during previous lives. \nThe panaceas the world knows of, the so-called religions for the guidance of humanity, do \nnot go a long way in solving the problem. As time goes on and the founder, the one who \nsupplied the motive force, is thrown and relegated more and more into the background of \ntime and obscurity, the aftermath of his manifestations, either a religion or an organisation, \ngradually loses its glamour and attractiveness, and there takes place a mental revolt against \nthe old order of things. A demand is created for something more tangible, substantial and \npractical, by contacting through which one may learn to live the true life, the life of the \nspirit. And you know that supply is in proportion to the demand. \nTo say that only decent living is the only way of attaining wider consciousness is only giving \none side of the picture. What you are today is the result of your decent and indecent living \nas well. Occult, spiritual and religious training serves merely as means to an end, and is a \ncondition precedent to entering the Path. But the moment one has the contact of a Perfect \nMaster, no such disciplinary process is necessary. The only thing required is complete \nsurrenderance to his supreme will, and the unquestioning willingness and attitude of mind \nto suffer and accept things as they come. \n1930s? \nEurope? \nA p37 \nQ. How about the believers who come in search of God, and are like sheep shorn by those \nwho are false priests? Is it better to have faith and be disillusioned, or have no faith? \nBaba: Any faith with the idea of Truth behind it is better than no faith at all. It is better to \nwalk the wrong road and return to the right way than not to walk at all. What matters \nspiritually is faith. When faith becomes love, there is no need for faith any longer. \n1939? \nBenares, about the false priests of Benares \nwhom Baba compared to vultures, \nT p98 \nReligion has to go, and God has to come, definitely. \n7 July 1940, \nGolkothi, Ranchi, \nLM7 p2580 \nThe work of the God-man in the universe is fundamentally different from the kind of thing \non which most of the priests set their hearts. \nMost of the priests of established religions attach too much importance to external forms, \nrituals and conformity. And since they are not themselves free from selfishness, narrowness \nor ignorance, they exploit the weak and credulous by holding before them the fear of hell or \nthe hope of heaven. \nThe God-man, on the other hand, has entered forever into the eternal life of love, purity, \nuniversality and understanding. And he is therefore concerned only with the things that \nreally matter, and which eventually bring about the inner unfoldment of the spirit in all \nwhom he helps. \n1941? \nIndia, \nDi v4 p20-21 \nAnother version: Aw 2:1 p29-30 \nThe organised religions of the world often fail to express the real vision of those who have \nbeen the fountainhead of inspiration for their very coming into existence. Dogmas and \nbeliefs, rituals and ceremonies, can never be the essence of the true spiritual life. They are \ngenerally not only superficial and inneffective, but positively harmful and misleading. Often \nthey not only feed the ego of the priest class, but also serve as an instrument for the \nexploitation of the credulous. \nWhen religion has become merely a matter of external rituals and ceremonies, it has \nbecome a cage for the soul. Nor does it help very much to change from one religion to \nanother. It is like going from one cage to another. If religion does not help man to \nemancipate the soul from spiritual bondage and realise God, it has no useful purpose to \nserve. Then it is time that religion should go to make room for God. \nI am therefore not interested in founding a new religion. The world is already divided by \nnumberless sects, based upon dogmas and beliefs. I have not come to give another cage for \nman, but to impart to the world the illimitable Truth. The world needs awakening, and not \nmere verbal instruction. It needs the freedom and the amplitude of divine life, and not the \nsuperficiality of mechanised and pompous forms. It needs love, and not the display of \npower. \nThe world task ahead of me is particularly creative. Essentially, we are all one. I am greater \nthan none of you in the soul sense, and really speaking, none of you have to receive divinity \nfrom me - the divinity that is eternally existing equally in us all. But what I have to give is \nthe knowledge and the experience of the oneness of us all. \nOut of the agonising travail and suffering of the present times, the new enlightened \nhumanity has to be born. Man shall be weaned away from the allurements of the ego-life. He \nshall come into full inheritance of his own divinity, and know himself to be none other than \nthe supreme God himself. And his heart shall be unlocked so as to release the dynamic love \ndivine. Divine love knows no decay, fear or corruption, because it is illumined by the \nunderstanding that all life is one. \nLet those who are alive to the real values hearken to this call of mine. They will have an \nample share in bringing into existence the new era of truth and love. I give my blessings to \nall. \n11 November 1944, \nNagpur, \nMe p65-66 \nThe deeper secrets of the spiritual life are unveiled to those who take risks and make bold \nexperiments with life. They are not intended for the weak-kneed who seek guarantees for \nevery step. \nAv p278 \nFrom all types of bondage - physical, mental, spiritual, social, political and moral - \nemancipation of man is possible, sooner or later. But the redemption of mankind from its \nself-imposed shackles of intellectual self-sufficiency, and idealistic or religious inheritance, \nis very different indeed, and the task, if ever attempted, is almost superhuman. \nThe institution of slavery in the Middle Ages was already bad enough. But the irresponsible \nslavery of this industrial age of ours is worse. Emancipation of mankind from such types of \nphysical and economic slavery is comparitively an easy affair. \nBut the most cruel and destructive form of slavery is an intellectual bigotry of possessing \nthe monopoly on truth, exclusive of others. It is such types of people, when they happen to \nwield temporal power on Earth, who hasten the downfall of a laboriously built civilisation, \nor the disintegration of a living religion. \nIntellect is, so to say, reserved by nature for man. One has to be a man to have intellect. But \nhowever keen and quick it may be, it will always be just one of the stepping stones to \nwisdom, inspiration, illumination, knowledge and Realisation of Truth, which is above all \nthese. \nTo keep playing on the stepping stone, however polished and shining it may be, is like \nsitting tight over an idle heap of hoarded wealth. \nLike everything else, intellect can be used as much as misused or abused. The deeper the \nintelligence, the greater the responsibility for discrimination between essentials and non-\nessentials, service and disservice, going forward or backward. \nMay you succeed in transcending the limitations of understanding, and crossing into the \ndomain of real knowledge, where nothing remains as unknown, unseen and unheard of; \nnay, everything becomes self-identified. My blessings to all. \n2 or 3 April 1947, \nMadras, \nLM9 p3158 \nWhat is wrong with the world today, and with India in particular? \nSuch and allied questions are bound to arise in thinking minds. But the answers are not \naltogether honest and straight. The diagnosis given and the remedies adopted have all been \nbiased and one-sided. The whole situation stands hopelessly vague and undetermined. \nThe crux of the situation lies in the correct understanding and reinterpreting of the ancient \nword 'religion.' \nThe West has very little of religion, and whenever we hear of it, it is subservient to politics, \nor at best a handmaid of material life. The East is suffering from an overdose of religion, and \nconsequently it is desperately hankering for a material antidote thereto. Religion in the \nWest is synonymous with scientific progress, which is destructive in its  manifestation. In \nthe East, and particularly in India, religion, instead of establishing the kingdom of God on \nEarth, has gone underground in the guise of crude ceremonies, rude rituals, and dead \ndogmas. \nInstead of engendering the seeds of peace and plenty, the under-driven religion tries to \nshoot out communalism, fanaticism, nationalism and patriotism, which have become \nbywords for leadership and greatness, suffering and sanctity. In short, religion, as a living \nforce, has become obsolete. The urgent need of today, to rescuscitate religion, is to dig it out \nof its narrow and dark hidings and coverings, and let the spirit of man shine out once again \nin its pristine glory. \nThe most practical thing to do in the world is to be spiritually-minded. It needs no special \ntime, place or circumstances. It is not necessarily concerned with anything out of the way of \nanyone's daily life and day-to-day routine. It is never too late or too early to be spiritual. It is \njust a simple question of having a right attitude of mind toward lasting values, changing \ncircumstances, avoidable eventualities, and a sense of the inevitable. \nSpirituality is neither restricted to, nor can it be restricted by, anyone or anything, \nanywhere, at any time. It covers all life for all time. Yet it can very easily be achieved with \nselfless service and pure love that know no bondage and seek no boundaries. A mighty \nsurge of this spirituality is about to sweep over the world. My blessings to you all. \n3 April 1947, \nMadras, \nLM9 p3159 \nRealisation of the self should not be confused with the intellectual understanding of the \nDivine Theme. Exceptional exercise of the intellect makes one a philosopher, a poet, a \nscientist or an artist. But Self-realisation is undeniably the special privilege of those who are \nmad after God. \nOrthodoxy, whether it be of the Hindu, Muslim Christian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, or any \nother church, is tolerable strictly and only up to a certain point, and only at the earlier \nphases of the evolution of the masses, since it conserves certain dynamic values coming \ndown through tradition. But it must be of the discriminative type, and should not be allowed \nto degenerate into politics. When orthodoxy denies to itself the spiritual light coming from \nany quarter, it inevitably reduces itself to a body without the soul, leading to separative \nignorance, conflicts and misunderstandings. \nLoyalty to the incarnated greatness of the past, and the mere possession and knowledge of \nthe traditional lore, is not all that is to be aspired for. It may preserve your individuality as a \nreligious and cultural unit, and make of you a political factor to be reckoned with. But in the \nspiritual domain, it makes you a nonentity, a tree without its life-giving sap. \nToday there are three concomitant factors which prevent the world from realisation of true \nspirituality: \n1. The church of each organised religion trades in the past, and fights every inch of ground \nbefore adjusting itself to the times and the circumstances. \n2. The educated delude themselves into thinking that they have done their part, and have \nlaid the whole creation and the Creator under deep gratitude by merely talking on the \nsubject from the purely intellectual point of view. \n3. And the masses have a superstitiously mercenary attitude towards saints and spirituality. \nTheir approach to saints is invariably from a material point of view. \nI have come to give a new understanding of spiritual value and truth to everyone. This truth \nis unlimited, and cannot be encaged in any dogmas or creeds or religions or sets of beliefs. \nInherit this vast truth which is ever-renewing, while I am in your midst. \nbefore 1948, ST p110-111 \nI belong to no religion. Every religion belongs to me. My own personal religion is of my \nbeing the ancient, infinite one, and the religion I teach to all is of love for God. \nThis love can be expressed by everyone, high, low, rich, poor, and everyone of every caste, \ncreed can love God. \nThe one God, who resides equally in all, is approachable to everyone through love. So I give \nmy blessings that at least some of you could love God as he is to be loved. \n28 February 1954, \nAmalapuram, Andhra, \nAD p102 \nAnother version: Journey With God, \nby Francis Brabazon, p30 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "SAINTS \nMeher Baba \nTo recognise a saint, you must first be a saint. \nDecember? 1925, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p772 \nThere are many who are on the way, many who have experience, many who are yogis, but \nfew who are Perfect... \nNever speak ill of saints. They are the sign of Truth and help to the world... \nMy salutations to all those who love God, who are saints, yogis, bhaktas, and my namaskar \nto Sadgurus. All these are me in different forms. \nfrom a letter to Ramjoo Abdulla \nJanuary 1926, \nWa p19 \nThe importance of saints is that they point so many to God. \nT p83, also MJ May 1939 \nThe saints are like the nerves of my body. They work for me, and I guide their lives. \nMJ 1:3 p62 \nThere are three types of spiritual beings in India: the sensational, the unassuming but deep \nand quiet, and the Man-God or God-Man. \nThe sensational types just make a show of their knowledge of Vedanta, and give lofty talks \non higher ideals of life and spirituality. It is all on the surface, hence an outward show. They \nseek to create an impression, and people who go to them are impressed by miracles, which \nare really nothing more than (tantric) tricks. This is undesirable, being a sort of bargaining. I \ndo not want this kind of faith. \nThe other type, which is unassuming and quiet, is deeper in knowledge and experience, \nbecause they are advanced souls, and a few are Perfect Ones. They prefer a quiet life, and do \ntheir work in silence, and hence are little known. \nThe Sadgurus and Qutubs experience Godhood and manhood both. They have attained the \nspiritual heights, and have also come down to human level to help mankind. Their methods \nare peculiar, hence not understood by ordinary people. \n17 November 1938, \nMeherabad, \nto Consuelo Sides and Mercedes D'Acosta \nLM7 p2335 \nI have lately been laying stress on honesty. If we love God honestly, we become one with \nhim. Never before have dishonesty and hypocrisy prevailed in this world as today. If the \nleast hypocrisy creeps into our thoughts, words and deeds, God, who is the innermost self in \nus all, keeps himself hidden. \nHypocrisy is a million-headed cobra. There are today so many so-called saints who, even \nthough they tell people to be honest and not to be hypocrites, are yet themselves deep in \ndishonesty. \nI say with divine authority that I am in you all, and if you honestly love God, you will find \nhim everywhere. \nAnd remember, if you cannot love God and cannot lead saintly lives, then at least do not \nmake a show of it, because the worst scoundrels are better than hypocritical saints. \nJanuary 27, 1953, \nEluru, Andhra, \nLC p27 \nThere are two types of so-called saintly persons: the hypocrites and the innocents. A \nhypocrite knows that he is posing, whereas the innocent one honestly feels that he is \nsomeone special spiritually. \n10 May 1954, \nMahabaleshwar, \nGG6 p44 \n... As far as you are concerned, you should neither criticise nor indulge in backbiting. If you \nspeak ill of a real saint, it will be harmful to you. You will create dreadful (sanskaric) \nblunders. You should avoid villifying even the so-called 'mahatmas' who call themselves \nsaints, because it is not possible for you to be certain whether they are real or not. \nThe presumptuous saints outwardly act like real saints. You will not be able to differentiate \nbetween them, just in the same way as you would not be able to differentiate between the \nmasts and mad persons. Yet what a world of difference lies in their inner states! \n... I would like you to know that to become a saint is not child's play. The very word saint, \nwhen commonly used or made applicable to anyone, creates a lot of misunderstanding. I \nwill tell you something that will clarify the misunderstandings regarding saints. \nThere are two types of saints: real saints, and imitation saints. Just as an ordinary person \ncannot distinguish between a real and an imitation pearl, you cannot distinguish between a \nreal saint and an imitation saint. I alone, like a jeweller, can make out the difference. \nParticularly in India, we find a lot of imitation saints, and this is due to the superficial study \nof Vedanta. By studying Vedanta, one can say 'I am God.' Sadgurus also say 'I am God.' \nImitation saints say the same thing, but with the help of Vedanta. Real saints need no such \nhelp; they say what they experience. \nThere are also some who, after reading Vedanta, realise that they have no such experience, \nbut they still say \"I am God.' This is hypocrisy. Also there are some imitation saints who, \nafter reading Vedanta, have a genuine feeling and say 'I am God,' though in reality they do \nnot have any conscious experience. \nIf anyone confers greatness on you and begins to worship you, you know yourself that you \ndo not deserve it. At the outset you are tempted to accept this greatness, which makes you \nfeel happy. But your conscience will be constantly pricking you, and you will be always in a \nstate of anxiety about future developments. You will be frequently in a fix whether to accept \nor reject the greatness which is thrust on you. \nOnce you accept this conferred greatness, it becomes very difficult for you to get out of the \nsituation. After a time, even the pricks of conscience cease troubling you, for you get used to \nthem. Then it becomes an addiction, and  you cannot do without it. You then pose as a real \nsaint. This posing will cause you to take innumerable additional births. So why pose as a \nsaint without inner experience? \n... When anyone approaches an imitation saint and is attracted by the outward atmosphere \nwhich he creates around him, and if, owing to his faith in the imitation saint, he gets \nexperiences, he is likely to attribute them to that imitation saint. This creates confusion. \n... In Uttar Pradesh and the Punjab, there are saints of both types, real and imitation. There, \nmen put up a big show of spirituality by performing homa-haven, bhajan-kirtan, yadna-\nyagna, arti-puja, etc. From external appearances one cannot make out who is a real saint \nand who is an imitation one. Anyone is easily impressed by the so-called outward spiritual \natmosphere. \n... I do not mean that there are no real saints in India. (Baba mentioned a few well-known \nsaints) There are also some real saints unknown to the masses. Compared to the known \nsaints, these hidden saints are far more advanced. In this respect, however, I want to tell \nyou with authority that both the hidden and the known saints have not realised the Self. \nDo not be misled by the use of certain words and phrases. If anyone addresses you as 'dear \nSelf,' do not be under the impression that he has achieved the goal of Realisation. \nMay 19 and June 7, 1957, \nto a group of his followers \nGuruprasad Poona, \nAw 5:4 p22-32 \nMore of this talk can be found in 'Visiting Saints' in Book Two \nFor one to declare that he is a saint, and allow people to bow down to and revere him \nwithout real authority, is to feed one's ego with intense happiness. Simultaneously with the \nfeeding of the ego comes a feeling of well-being. \nOne who is addicted to opium (eating or smoking) derives a similar feeling of well-being, \nthough temporarily. After a time the opium addict begins to feel the after-effects of opium in \nsevere constipation, loss of appetite, headache, dullness and drowsiness. He then begins to \nrealise that it would have been better had he not become addicted. But unfortunately, he \ncannot give up the habit. He has become a slave. He realises this too late, and sinks into \ndeeper addiction, being tempted to take greater and greater quantities of opium to keep \npace with the gradual loss of the feeling of well-being. \nSimilarly, one who indulges in happiness by allowing people to bow down to him without \nauthority feels the prick of conscience later on. And with this feeling he realises that he has \nno authority, but has got so used to the habit of feeding his ego in this manner that he is \nunable to stop the practice. He continues indulging, and after a time does not pay heed to \nthe pricks of conscience. He becomes numb to the voice within. \nAfter years of addiction, it so happens one day that the opium addict is found lying \nunconscious in a gutter full of filth. An extra overdose of opium proves tragic for the addict, \nwho loses complete control over himself. The passer-by scoffs, ridicules, points at him as a \nconfirmed opium addict. \nIn the same way, a person who poses as a saint, without really being one, starts to behave in \nan unworthy manner after years of indulgence in addiction to overdoses of homage. With \nhim, contrary to the opium addict, his unworthy behavior is accounted as Perfection by his \nfollowers. When he abuses others, his words are accepted as blessings. When he beats \nsomeone, his beating is accepted as the descent of his grace. When he indulges in \nlovemaking with the opposite sex, it is accepted as pure love. \nIn short, whatever he does, all and everything is accepted in a spirit of reverence and love \nby the followers of the man who has posed as a saint. The more unruly his behavior, the \ngreater the admiration of the followers. And the greater the admiration, the richer becomes \nthe feeding of the ego of the person. Eventually he falls from the high pedestal of admiration \nbecause, not being a genuine saint, the rich doses of admiration and reverence prove too \nmuch for the ego to digest. With the fall this opiumised saint is ridiculed. Those very \npersons who called themselves his followers scoff and call him a fraud. \nJust as an opium addict has his personal friends who extol the effect of opium and bring into \ntheir fold innocent people, so, too, a person who poses as a saint has a ring of followers who \nextol him and his 'miracles' to attract others into their fold. Such 'miracles' may be just \ncoincidences, or even genuine experiences of simple and devout followers who get desired \nresults through their own faith in and love even for such opiumised saints. \nOne who has no authority and yet permits people to bow down to him plays a losing game, \nwhile those who bow down gain. The unburdening of sanskaras of those who bow down at \nhis feet is the cause of his loss, for he takes on sanskaras that can only be wiped off by many \nmore births. \nThe point to be considered is this: if thousands can benefit at the cost of a false saint, should \nthis person be allowed to continue? If such a person is already in contact with a Perfect \nMaster and loves him, the Master immediately puts a check and corrects the shortcomings, \nand warns his lovers about such unauthorised behavior. \nIf however, such a person is not already in contact with a Perfect Master, the Master never \ninterferes, because eventually this person also derives some benefit. The Master knows that \nthis is the play of ego. The cause of any eventual benefit to such a person is that at the cost \nof his own condemnation he proved to be a dustbin for thousands to heap their sanskaras \ntherein. \nThere is no doubt that in his subsequent birth his behavior makes the person suffer much \nmore due to this burden of acquired sanskaras. But with the intensity of his suffering, the \nredeeming factor is the speed with which these acquired sanskaras get wiped off. They are \nwiped off in proportion to the intensity of suffering. Along with the wiping off of the \nacquired sanskaras, his own sanskaras also get wiped off speedily. \nJust as an unauthorised person posing as a saint proves a source of benefit to thousands, so \nalso he proves of harm to many. All this is a play in illusion. As an opium addict feels happy \nto give a tiny bit of opium to another, and that other, when he gets the taste of it, hands over \nanother small dose to his own friend, creating a circle of opium eaters, the two or three \npersons close to the opiumised saint of our discourse start spreading news that such and \nsuch a woman was blessed with a child, and that another got her wish fulfilled, and that the \n'saint' performed many such miracles. A clique of followers around the opiumised saint is \ncreated. \nBut this happy picture does not last long, for after some years it so happens that at least one \nfinds out one day that his master is a fraud and is not God-realised. The impact of such a \ngreat setback in his confirmed belief is so forceful that all his sanskaras, which he had \ninadvertently transferred onto the 'saint' in his belief and devotion, all of a sudden recoil on \nhim spontaneously and overburden him afresh. Thus the person who had placed faith in the \nopiumised saint suffers a great deal. \nLet us view the picture from another angle: suppose I am the opiumised saint, and you love \nme and revere me as the Perfect Master. Your love becomes so deep and your faith so great \nthat you actually make progress on the spiritual Path, and really begin to have experiences \nof the Path. In this instance, you are surely benefitted at the hands of the opiumised saint. \nWhereas in the previous case, the opiumised saint has done a great harm. Through such \n'saints' harm and benefit recoil and accrue. \nBut all this is a play in illusion. It is all my play. None can fathom me as I really am. I am in \neveryone, and I do everything simultaneously. I also do nothing. Be brave. Be happy. I and \nyou are all one. And the infinite that eternally belongs to me will one day belong to every \nindividual. \nPL p67-70 \n...The lingering aura of a saint may work miracles from his burial place. \n1958? Be p36 \nWe find three types of Gurus or masters in the world at all times: \n1. The imposter; \n2. The genuine but limited Guru, the Wali or master of the 5th plane, and the Pir or master \nof the 6th plane; \n3. The perfect Guru or Sadguru, who is God-realised. \nWhen a Wali is pleased with someone, he whispers or breathes a divine word in his ear, or \nhe looks steadily into the eyes of the person concerned, and causes a lift in that person's \nconsciousness. In this heightened consciousness, the person can easily read the thoughts of \nthose near him if he wants to. He sees colored lights, and sometimes sees the face of the \nWali within the light. But the Wali may raise one to his own level of consciousness, and \ncause him to identify himself with the mental body, and he sees his gross and subtle bodies \ndistinctly as garments that he wears. Although this raising of another's consciousness is not \nmere hypnotism, but bestowal of an experience of a very high order, the state enjoyed, \nbeing within the domain of limitation (had) is still part of the passing show of illusion. The \nangle of vision has merely shifted from what it was previously. The view is vastly greater, \nbut he still faces maya with his back to God. \nA Pir does not use either of the methods of the Wali. When he is pleased with someone, he \nmay ask for a glass of water or a cup of tea, and taking a sip or two, may give it to him to \ndrink. Or he may ask the person for something, such as a hankerchief or scarf, and after \nusing it for some time, return it to him. By such a seemingly insignificant action, the Pir may \nbring him up through any of the lower planes, even to his own station, and cause him to take \na complete about-turn, so that maya is forever behind him, and before him is the \nindescribable beauty and glory of God. \nIn his lifetime a Wali and a Pir can raise one person, or at most two persons, to his own level \nof consciousness. A Pir cannot take anyone beyond the sixth plane, which denotes the very \nedge of limitation. There is an abyss to be crossed between the sixth and the seventh planes \nof consciousness, between the last point in limitation and infinite limitlessness, the goal. A \nPir is himself in the realm of duality, and therefore cannot take anyone to the unitive state of \nunlimited consciousness. A Sadguru, being beyond the bounds of limitation, can and does do \nso. He utilizes infinite ways (including direct physical touch, or even just a wish) for the \nbestowing of his grace on the ones he chooses, to make them transcend duality and merge \nin the consciousness of God the unlimited (Behad). \nA Wali or a Pir necessarily requires the physical presence of a person whose level of \nconsciousness he intends to raise. But time and space are no obstacles to a Sadguru when he \nwishes to bestow his grace on any person or thing. The person concerned may be thousands \nof miles away, or not even in a physical body. Just a wish of the Sadguru can instantaneously \nestablish that particular individual in the consciousness of the seventh plane of \nlimitlessness (Behad)... \nA Pir can make one see God. But even then one's 'real I' still has falseness attached to it. A \nSadguru, at the right moment, whisks away entirely the entire falseness. And how does he \ndo it? That is inexplicable. Only he who is knowledge itself can do this. When falseness is \nentirely shed, real individuality is established. This is the 'I am God' state. \nc.1960, EN p29-31 \nWhen one is on the sixth plane, one sees God face to face and experiences bliss. One on the \nGross plane can also see God everywhere, by the grace of the Avatar or a Perfect Master. \nSuch a one experiences bliss. But there is a world of difference between his experience and \nthe sublime bliss of the one on the sixth plane of consciousness. Whereas on the Gross plane \none has desires and the mind to contend with, the one who is on the sixth plane longs only \nto become one with beloved God. \nAO p217 \nThere are only 100,000 Satpurushas or Marden-e-Khuda in the whole of the universe. They \nare those on the spiritual Path who have achieved control over their ego-life, and who with \nutter disregard to life expose themselves to hardships in the name of, and for the sake of \nGod. \nIt is not because these men and women of God find their lives to be any less precious than \nthat of the average man or woman, who as a rule is only too anxious to maintain a hold over \nthe fast-slipping human life. Their indifference is due to the fact that, to them, their love for \nGod is far greater than their own limited existence. \nIt is not just a question of giving up a life here in order to gain a better life there. To them \nnothing else remains worthwhile to be had or wished for, save their love for God. \nPL p64-65 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "SANSKARAS \nMeher Baba \nA yogi, even after he attains the highest yogic state in his study, does not reach freedom, \nbecause there are still for him the sanskaras (meaning impressions) to finish up with. \nSanskaras mean the impressions left behind when doing any good or bad action. Even a \nthought creates a sanskara. Talking, hearing, thinking, seeing, eating, sleeping, etc. - in fact, \neven Subtle movements - cause sanskaras or impressions, which have to be experienced \nwithout a single hitch, with a mechanical precision, unless removed away root and branch \nby a Master's grace or blessing. \nOur present existence and all the related experiences of pain and pleasure, virtue and sin \nabout it, are the results of our past sanskaras, or amal, as termed by the Muslims. \nThe very breath we breathe, the eyelid we twitch, the finger we lift, are all due to past \nimpressions. Our present existence is the mere unfoldment of our past Subtle impressions \nin Gross form. And again, it is our present Gross actions that recreate impressions, and so \non. A good word or a good action has its good result compressed in an impression - suppose \nin the form of a circle - and a bad word or action likewise stores up a bad result in a similar \nSubtle form. \nThat is, good actions in this life necessitate acquiring a happier state in the next formation. \nAnd similarly, a bad action in the present life brings about a bad result in the same way. \nThere is that tie, which has not been dispensed away in any case. \nGood actions bind a man with a golden chain, and bad actions with iron and spiked chains. \nBut the chain is there in either case. The man has not been set free. Yoga or other studies are \ngood actions, and they give the person a better chance in the next incarnation. But they do \nnot set him free, or give Liberation. To have Liberation, one must neither have virtue nor \nvice on one's credit or debit side. But it should be a clean slate, to reach the state described \nin an Urdu couplet: \n'We shall not go either to heaven or hell; \nBut on the day of final judgement \nwe shall stand gazing at the face of Muhammad.' \nAnd this is impossible to reach without the grace of the Guru. For a Master, it is the work of \na moment, though. The vast and almost infinite impressions of a person may be likened to a \nheap of dry grass, which it is impossible for the person to clean out. Even the  process of \ncleaning out without a Master, that is, through yoga, etc., means contracting impressions \nagain in different forms. \nBut this heap of dry grass is a work of a moment for a lighted match, which only the Perfect \nMaster possesses. The Perfect Master uses his matches, but mostly for the members of his \nCircle only, and thus at the right moment brings them to his own level in less than a second. \nBut even those who have no direct connection with a Perfect Master can derive the greatest \npersonal benefit merely through the contact and company of his personality: \n'One moment, half a moment, and even half of a half of a moment in contact with a Perfect \nMaster, and ten million of your sins are washed away.' \n4 October 1922, Manzil-e-Meem, \nBombay, RD p70-80 \nAbout Meher Baba's flag: \nThe flag should be of seven colors... \nDo you know why I suggested a seven color flag? The seven colors represent the seven \nplanes of consciousness. Red should be at the bottom of the flag, and sky blue at the top. \nArrangement of the other five colors is your decision... \nBesides representing the seven planes of consciousness, these colors also represent \nsanskaras - impressions. The colors in the flag signify man's rise from the grossest of \nimpressions of lust and anger, symbolised by red, to the culmination in the highest state of \nspirituality and oneness with God, symbolised by sky blue. \n23 April 1924, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p619 \nWithout the sanskaras being totally eliminated, there is no spiritual Liberation. To dispose \nof sanskaras, one has to create reverse sanskaras which are opposite in nature. Opposite \nimpressions reverse the sanskaric makeup of the mind. To remove stains, soap or lime is \nnecessary. But the mind never dies of itself. \nFor example, suppose your hand is to be broken. It is difficult and almost impossible for you \nto twist your own hand enough to break it. But if a strong fellow comes along and twists it, \nyour hand fractures in a second. That powerful man is the Sadguru, who is required to deal \nwith the mind and all its mischief. \nBut a Sadguru is not to be found so easily. It requires love, the search for Truth amidst \nhardships and sufferings, and undergoing untold difficulties. These draw the Sadguru to the \ndeserving ones. \nIf by hurting a person temporarily, you provide a permanent healing, this apparently cruel \nact of yours is, in fact, a blessing. In the same way, suppose that by rendering a temporary \nhealing, you create a permanent hurt. This apparently blessed act of yours is, in fact, a curse. \nA doctor cutting open a boil and causing so much pain to the sufferer is considered an \nenemy who has hurt one. But when the pus is removed, the patient is relieved, and the \ndoctor is considered a real friend who helped. \nSo the Sadguru is at first apparently considered an enemy when he tries to remove sins and \nwipe out desires and sanskaras of the aspirant by forcing strict discipline on him, \nrenunciation, etc. But when the bliss of union with the beloved God is attained through his \ngrace, he is considered a true friend. \n9 December 1927, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p991 \nAll thoughts, words and acts cause sanskaras or impressions on one's mind. Sanskaras are \nof seven different colors, the same as those of a rainbow. \nOrdinary good thoughts cause impressions of a light blue color. \nWhen such thoughts are put into actions, either in words or deeds, the impressions \ngenerally caused are of a deep blue color. \nAnger and wicked deeds like murder cause sanskaras of red color. Red sanskaras are the \nworst, and they are difficult to be wiped out. \nIntense spiritual longing gives rise to sanskaras of the green color. Just as red sanskaras are \nthe worst, so the green ones are the best. \nbefore July 1930, \nMs 2:7 p8 (July 1930) \nThe obstacles to Illumination are certain mental tendencies and desires connected with \negoism, which in the East are called sanskaras. The sum total of these tendencies and \ndesires creates the illusion of a separate self at war with or isolated from other selves. \nEvolution, or the fall into matter, made the creation of such a separate self necessary. \nOtherwise, spiritual consciousness could never be attained in the flesh. \nIn the beginning, before evolution began, we were united with the source of all, and (have) a \nconsequent conscious longing to return to it through a succession of lives and forms. The \nconscious return to the source during physical incarnation only became possible when \nconsciousness became equilibrated in Gross matter. \n22 May 1932, \nNew York, \nMe p89 \nOther versions: PM p169-171, LM5 p1626-1627 \nQ. What makes us wake up? \nBaba: Impressions, sanskaras. They prick you - 'Get up! Spend us!' Sanskaras are \nimpressions. You become angry. Your mind immediately gets the impression of anger. Now \nthis impression is on the subconscious mind. But it remains stamped deep in your \nsubconscious mind. Unless these impressions go, mind cannot become still. Now, these \nimpressions must be spent or experienced in the Gross form. \nQ. What do you mean by sanskaras to be spent? Can they be worked out on the Subtle \nplane? \nBaba: No. Some, very rarely, go by themselves. Mostly they have to be experienced in the \nGross. You think, you act - all these create sanskaras, which you must work out. It is a long \nprocess, this working out in innumerable forms. \n18 January 1937, \nNasik, \nAw 16:2 p20 \nWhat, really, are sanskaras? Impressions is the literal meaning. Whatever impression the \nmind receives is called sanskaras, and then these sanskaras again have to be spent and \nexperienced. All your actions and desires are given shape by these impressions. \nFor example, in a camera you take different impressions of one certain movement, and \nmany impressions shape that one movement. When you see one movement in the film, you \nknow how many pieces go to make up that one film. These are, let us say, sanskaras. They \nare imprinted on the mind. \nNow, naturally, any action, any thought, any desire will have its impression. Good actions, \ngood desires, good thoughts will have good sanskaras. Bad actions, bad thoughts, bad \ndesires will have bad sanskaras. Both good or bad, both bind, because both have to be \nexperienced. Both have to be spent. \nSo it is impossible to be rid of sanskaras by one's own self, because whatever you do, it \nbinds. You may think the highest thought - it binds. So too does pity, compassion, virtue, \ngratitude; all these help to bind. I pity, I am grateful, I fast, I pray, I want God, I want union \nwith God - all these bind. \nSo how to escape from these bindings? You see, and this mere seeing binds. This will leave \nits impressions on the mind. You scratch your head - this too binds. There is satisfaction. \nThat is why the soul has to go through numberless phases of illusion, because duality is \nbased on sanskaras. \nYou seek the supreme. As a matter of fact, you are supreme, but you are entangled in \nillusion. How can you escape? Everything binds, everything gives a sense of I. Whatever you \naspire to binds, and so everyone, whether poor, rich, healthy, sick, philosopher, sinner or \nsaint, have moments of depression and unhappiness due to the soul being burdened with \nthis load of impressions on its mind. \nHow to escape from this load? The only wanting, the only desiring that binds for freedom is \nlove. The lover too wants. The lover wants union, but in this union the I gets so feeble that \nthe binding, instead of hindering, helps to free. The moth around the candle-flame wants \nunion with the flame, but the wanting I is so feeble that the moth does not think for a \nmoment about the result, and is not a bit afraid of being burnt. Why? I in love is very feeble. \nIs it clear? \n5 May 1937, \nNasik, \nAw 16:2 p53 \nA number of people had come to see Meher Baba, and were standing in line. One young man \nin the line was weeping. When he came before Baba, Baba looked into his eyes and asked, \n\"Did you carry out all my orders?' The man did not answer. Baba spelled out on the board, \nAn order is much more important than any amount of spiritual longing, or gifts of thousands \nof rupees. \nThere are seven colors of sanskaras. Red is the worst and the deepest. It is the most lasting \nimpression, and takes the longest to be wiped out. These red sanskaras are caused by the \nsex act, hence they are a great check on the progress and advancement. The sex act is \nconsidered a grave sin on the Path, and prohibited to spiritual aspirants. \nThoughts of sexual desire may come, and even a rush of impulses, but one should not \ncommit any action with another person. Even masturbation is better, though it is harmful to \nthe physique. Sexual intercourse has the worst consequences. It attracts to oneself the \nworst sanskaras of ages past of one's partner, hence it is most difficult to wipe out. It incurs \nimmense ineradicable damage to one's spiritual progress. \n21 December 1937, \nBombay, \nLM7 p2249 \nNow I will give you some very new facts concerning sanskaras. Truly, no philosophical \nbooks explain the term properly. \nSanskaras are impressions of duality which make the soul go through the process of duality \nto attain unity with God. The soul cannot attain unity consciously unless it goes through \nconscious experiences of duality, and these experiences of duality cannot be had but by \nimpressions of duality. \nSanskaras in general are called prarabdha sanskaras. Prarabdha literally means 'of destiny.' \nThese are applied to the whole universe in evolution from the state of a minute atom to the \nstate of God-realisation. Prarabdha sanskaras are those that help the soul gain \nconsciousness in order to go through evolution - from the very beginning to the very end - \nto attain unity. \nFor the Realised soul who does not return to normal consciousness, there are no sanskaras. \nBut the soul who, after God-realisation, returns to normal consciousness, automatically gets \na universal mind, and to be able to work through duality, gets superfluous unbinding \nsanskaras  that are called Yogayoga sanskaras. The literal meaning of Yogayoga is \nautomatic. Very few Perfected souls have these Yogayoga sanskaras because very few of the \nGod-realised return to normal consciousness - to phenomenal consciousness. \nNow the Avatar, being one always, and having his Circle of 120 always - the same each time \n- this Avatar gives to his Circle the Vidnyani sanskaras. Vidnyani literally means 'the \nthreshold to unity.' The Avatar, when taking form, for himself and the Circle gives himself \nand the Circle the Vidnyani sanskaras before birth. It is similar to a veil being drawn, and \nexactly at the time appointed by himself, the Avatar experiences his original divinity, and \nthen works with the Vidnyani sanskaras. \nThe Circle, until they are Realised, are under this veil of Vidnyani sanskaras, having all the \nordinary signs of the ordinary sanskaras of duality. When the time comes, the Avatar gives \nthe Circle Realisation. However, until then the Vidnyani sanskaras, though they remain with \nthe person, are only an instrument for universal work, just as his have been. \nMuch of Christ's teaching in the New Testament is symbolic, if rightly understood. Christ \ntalked of evolution, impressions, reincarnation, exactly as in Vedanta. \nThe Prarabdha impressions which govern the whole universe of duality are of greed and its \nopposite; of anger and its opposite; of all bad and of all good thoughts, words and deeds. \nGood sanskaras, bad sanskaras - both are Prarabdha. \nTo be free from Prarabdha sanskaras, either the good sanskaras must overlap the bad \nsanskaras, either the good sanskaras must overlap the bad sanskaras, the individual ego \nmust be annihilated by service, or the limited self must merge in love. \nGood sanskaras and bad sanskaras are impressions, and both bind. Due to the evolutionary \nprocess, the soul gathers all sanskaras throughout, up to the human form - animal \nsanskaras, as they are called. Therefore in human form, when the soul is fully conscious, the \nbad sanskaras already overlap the good ones. If now the good sanskaras were to overlap the \nbad ones, what would happen is that both would disappear. Like the dream example I once \ngave: \nIf you see yourself in a dream in which you enjoy becoming the queen, it continues for a \nlong time. And if, all of a sudden, you see in the dream a snake attacking you, you wake up - \nboth good and bad dreams disappear. Here it was good at first - of enjoying becoming \nqueen, and then the bad - of a snake attacking you. This is bad overlapping good. Both \ndisappear on waking. So either the bad must overlap the good, or the good overlap the bad. \nBut if already the soul has gathered impressions of greed, of anger, of lust - now they must \nbe overlapped by their opposites - generosity, love, peace. \nIn the second instance, of service: when you think, not of yourself, but of others, the thought \nabout your own ego is replaced by thinking of others, and gradually you forget yourself in \nserving others. \nIn the third instance, love: when the lover loves the beloved to the extent of losing the self in \nthe beloved, then only the beloved remains. So naturally impressions then disappear. \nIt is so easy to do bad, and so difficult to do good. Why? Because bad is already there. \nReturning to the first point, I will give you two examples: of good overlapping the bad, of \nbad overlapping the good, and how both disappear. A dish is dirty. You take soap and water, \nand overlap the dirt with soap. Then in washing it, both disappear. Here the water is you. \nYou are always present in the process of overlapping. \nThe Indian way of cleaning a dish full of grease is with mud. Without water it will come \nclean. Both grease and mud disappear. In the overlapping of opposites - mud is the most \ngreaseless thing, and therefore opposite - the object is for both to disappear and attain a \nclean dish. \nWhen good sanskaras overlap the bad, and bad sanskaras overlap the good, then both \ndisappear, and your mind is a clean slate with nothing written on it. All is wiped off. \nNothing is ever written on you - but on your mind. You, the soul, remain untarnished. Good \nand bad, everything is written on your mind. When the impressions go, then all is wiped out. \nMind sees the soul - this is Illumination. When good and bad are written off the mind, mind \nsees the soul. Mind then tries to become one with the soul - this is Realisation. \nMind seeing the soul means you seeing God. But mind does not become you, you being God. \nMind must merge in the soul for you to become God. When mind merges in soul, then you \nare God-realised. \n22 December 1937, \non the train 'Flying Rani' \nen route from Bombay to Navsari \nLM7 p2250-2252 \nThere are two aspects of human experience, the subjective and the objective. On the one \nhand there are mental processes, which constitute essential ingredients of human \nexperience; and on the other hand there are things and objects to which they refer. The \nmental processes are partly dependent upon the immediately given objective situation; and \nthey are partly dependent upon the functioning of the accumulated sanskaras or \nimpressions of previous experience. The human mind thus finds itself between a sea of past \nsanskaras on one side, and the whole extensive objective world on the other. \nFrom the psycho-genetic point of view, human actions are seen to be based upon the \noperation of the impressions stored in the mind through previous experience. Every \nthought and emotion and every act is grounded in groups of impressions which, when \nconsidered objectively, are seen to be modifications of the mind-stuff of man. These \nimpressions are deposits of previous experience, and become the most important factors in \ndetermining the course of present and future experience. \nThe mind is constantly creating and gathering such impressions in the course of its \nexperience. When occupied with the physical objects of this world, such as body, nature and \nother things around, the mind is, so to say, externalised, and creates Gross impressions; and \nwhen it is busy with its own subjective mental processes (which are the expressions of \nalready existing sanskaras), it creates Subtle and Mental impressions. \n1938? \nIndia? \nDi v1 p36-37 \n... Because of these covers of the mind and body, the drop does not see the ocean. \nNow, what happens? The body drops, but the mind remains. And when the body drops, its \nimpressions immediately manifest, trying to spread themselves and assume a new body. \nThey want expression through the body, and so another body comes into existence which is \nmade up of these impressions. \nThus, with the dropping of every form, the sanskaras want to take another body. If these \nsanskaras are crooked, meaning evil, the body is also crooked - diseased, for example. If the \nsanskaras are evil, the body suffers pain; if they are good, the mind is happy. \nSo long as the mind is there, the impressions also will be there, and with these, the body \nalso. The soul won't see God until the sanskaras are finished. \nDropping of the body is therefore of no avail, but if the mind goes, then there are no \nsanskaras left. They disappear. \nBut the paradox is that the body's falling and sanskaras asking for another body to spend \nthemselves help the soul gradually to gain self-consciousness for the drop to see the ocean - \nthe Oversoul. \nThen, what is required? The mind must go; then alone can these impressions gathered \nautomatically disappear. Then the body - the drop soul - sees the ocean. This was the \noriginal state of God. But at that time the soul (atma) was sleeping with its eyes closed. \n(Baba closed his eyes, and then opened them) \nNow the eyes are opened because the veil of the mind and body has disappeared. \nIf you listen carefully, your eyes will open too. \n17 May 1943, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p2879 \nThe same action can create different impressions according to the motive which inspires \nthat action. A man who, out of the motive of doing good to another person, gives him food or \nclothes, at once catches his good impressions. The man who slanders another person with \nan evil motive, or steals his things, at once catches his evil impressions. \nKilling an animal for sport or pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since \nthe motive is selfish. But no such bad impressions are caught from snakes and germs and \nthe like, which are a danger to humanity, when they are killed out of philanthropic motives, \nand only when absolutely necessary. Such killing, where it is not a duty, will certainly create \nbinding impressions. \nConversation, cinema, books, radio, meetings, travels, crowds and so on are various \nmediums through which there is give and take of diverse types of impressions on a \nstupendous scale. In short, the cycle of impressions is interminable, except when the \naspirant slowly and patiently takes to the uphill emancipatory spiritual Path under the \nguidance of a Truth-realised Master and with his blessings. \nThe impressions in the ego-minds of all, whether Gross, Subtle or Mental, are largely similar. \nBut their colors are different, and of innumerable variety, according to the spiritual position \nof different individuals. Consciousness gets committed to some illusion or another owing to \nthese mental impressions, which are ever active in spite of the daily respite of dream and \nsleep... \nThe physical body is nothing but the Gross form of impressions. The Mental impression in \nthe mind of the male parent first takes a Subtle form, which then is released in the Gross \nform of mating. The mass of sanskaras or impressions thus released ultimately reaches the \nmind of the female parent, and it is from the mind of the female parent that the process of \nphysical incarnation starts. The soul which is awaiting reincarnation in the Gross body can \ndescend only if, during the process of sanskaric or impressional exchange between the male \nand female, their minds have come as near to stopping as possible. \nThe physical body is produced by the working of many impressions, and it is the result of \ntheir very embodiment. It is therefore no wonder that it has a tendency to bind the soul \nwhich inhabits it. Love for the physical body is only a form of deep ignorance. The swine \ndelight in the refuse - so do the ignorant ones take delight in the body... \nImpressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because \ntherein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more \nsusceptible to lust and anger. Sometimes innumerable strong impressions are transmitted \nthrough the mere touch of the physical body of another person. A Gross body, even a corpse, \ncan quickly impart numberless impressions to the person who touches it. Sex contact \noutside wedlock is the worst form of exposure to heavy and binding impressions of lust. In \nwedlock the impressions exchanged are much lighter and less binding. \nBut just as bad and binding impressions can be caught from others, good and emancipatory \nimpressions can also be caught from others. Food or eatables prepared or given by others \nbring their sanskaras with them. The prasad (some sweet or fruit or drink given as a vehicle \nof grace) distributed by saints and Masters, gives to the recipient spiritual and \nemancipatory impressions. \nThe custom of touching the feet of the Master with the head is based upon the fact that the \nspiritual and emancipatory impressions from the Master thereby go to the very mind-heart \nof the recipient in a fraction of a second. The Truth-realised Master transmits dynamic \nimpressions of faith and love for God through appropriate spiritual experience. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1948, ST p23-27 \nGod manifests his presence when and where lust, greed, anger, jealousy, hatred, back-biting \nand selfish desires are totally absent. But, as they are the outcome of impressions \n(sanskaras) of past lives, and must necessarily be expressed, getting rid of them is \nordinarily impossible. It would be like a rock trying to lift itself. \nNevertheless, past impressions must be expressed to be got rid of. But at the same time that \nthese past impressions are being expressed and spent, new ones are forged, because of the \npresence and assertion of the lower self. If one is to be free of the endless chain of \nimpressions, past and present, this assertive lower self must be abolished. \nOnly when one's assertive (lower) self is removed can the impressions be automatically \nspent without incurring the binding of fresh sanskaras. One who has achieved this can \nnever be bound by, or held responsible any more, for his actions, good or bad, which are the \nexpression of his past impressions of virtue, patience, lust, anger, etc. Thus, with the \ncessation of new sanskaras, all past impressions naturally unwind to the finish, and one is \nfree of all impressions. \nTo follow the path of the true yogas - karma yoga, dnyan yoga, raj yoga, bhakti yoga - is the \nremedy for the uprooting of this heritage of evils derived from past impressions, expressed \nby constant actions, and sustained by the continual formation of new ones. \nIn karma yoga, one tries to lose one's self in selfless service for others. In dnyan yoga one \ntries to lose one's self in contemplation and meditation. In raj yoga one tries to lose one's \nidentity with the individual self, and establish identity with the universal self by aiming, \nthrough constant mental poise and non-attachment, to be in the world and yet not of  it. In \nbhakti yoga one tries to lose one's self in devotion to God. Even in these yogas, only when \nthe zenith is reached can the individuality of the lower self be lost, yet consciousness \nremain. \nBut the easiest and safest way to lose one's self is by completely surrendering to the Perfect \nMaster. Then the past, present and future of the one who has surrendered are drowned in \nthe Master, and he is no longer either bound by, or responsible for, any of his actions, \nwhether good or bad, expressed during his implicit obedience to the Master. Thus complete \nsurrenderance to the Perfect Master is, in itself, freedom. \nFebruary or March 1954, \nMD p9-10 \nAlso Gl Feb. 1978 p24 \nFor more about sanskaras, see Di (7th ed.) p32-60 and ST p23-27 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "THE SPIRITUAL HIERARCHY \nMeher Baba \nGarrett Fort: Is there really the place known as Shambala, the Astral centre where the \nMasters dwell in disembodied form? \nBaba: It is presumed that you already know that planes are not places. The state and stage \nconnoting Shambala exists. There is difference of terminology only. This is also known as \nVidnyan. \nGarrett Fort: Are there seven rays as told about in the occult books, and are there Masters \nwho function on these respective rays, such as Jesus, who stands on what is called the sixth \nray of devotion, or abstract realism; the Master Djwal Khul on the second ray of \nlove/wisdom; the Master Hilarion on the fifth ray of concrete knowledge or science, the \nincarnation of Paul of Tarsus, this time in a Cretan body and spending much time in Egypt? \nBaba: The seven rays with their peculiar characteristics are a symbolic expression of the \nseven stages of the return journey of a Realised soul to normal consciousness. Those \nRealised beings who have a duty to perform and a mission to fulfill, have to come down to \nnormal consciousness and take their stand at one of the seven stages of the return journey \nbest suited for the fulfillment of their task. These seven stages of the return journey have \ntheir peculiar features and characteristics, and reflect the outward circumstances of a \nMaster. For instance, one Master lives on earth like a prince, another lives in all austerity. \nOne is in the midst of the busy world, another in seclusion. The powers are peculiar to \ndifferent stages. For instance, healing of diseases and bringing of the dead to life is \ncharacteristic of the fourth stage. \nGarrett Fort:  Where is the Hall of Learning of which I have read, where those on the Path \nare taken as they progress to take the first few initiations? Books allegedly dictated by \nHilarion describe it impressively, telling of the great host of souls who stand within it, \nveiled, thinking themselves alone until their veils are raised with various initiations. Here \ntake place the ceremonies of the soul that begin in December and last until Easter. Is all this \ntrue, or just told as symbolism? \nBaba: Hall of Learning is pure symbolism. It is analogous to Islamic belief and picture of \nDarbare Muhammadi, i.e. the court of Muhammad. The inner court presided over by \nMuhammad in person, and the outer court presided over by deputies, and the outermost \ncourt consisting of those prepared souls clamoring for entry, is similar to the picture drawn \nby Hilarion, as you say. \n1936, \nIndia, \nA p26-28, \nalso T p195-197 \n\"Qutub in Sufism means Center. That Center controls the whole universe through his \nAgents. Meetings are held, but these meetings cannot be seen with the physical eye.\" \n7 February 1937 \nRahuri, \nLM6 p2091 \n\"There are 56 Perfect Ones in the world at all times. They are always one in consciousness. \nThey are always different in function. For the most part, they live and work apart from and \nunknown to the general public. But five, who act in a sense as a directing body, always work \nin public, and attain to public prominence and importance. They are known as Sadgurus or \nPerfect Masters. In Avataric periods, the Avatar, as a supreme Sadguru, takes his place as \nthe head of this body, and of the spiritual hierarchy as a whole.\" \n1938, India, Di v1 p3 \nThe Spiritual Hierarchy Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved. Email mehersthan at gmail.com \nThe Now 1 \nThe Now 1 \nTHE SPIRITUAL HIERARCHY \nBook Two \n\"Meher Baba has explained that the majority of masts are to be found in India, which is the \nmost important country in the world from the spiritual point of view.* Apart from those in \nIndia, there are a few masts in Arabia, a very few in parts of Iran (these few are mostly in \nMeshed and Tabriz), and a very few in Egypt, China and Tibet. As far as countries outside \nAsia are concerned, there are, with the exception of  Egypt, no masts in any other part of the \nworld. \n\"There are, however, God-lovers, a few advanced souls, and certain people who are Agents \nof the Saheb-e-Zaman (Avatar). These Agents are holders of definite and distinct offices. Just \nas the Christ-state, the Nabuwat-e-Mohammedi (or whatever name it is known by) is \nactually the office held by each Saheb-e-Zaman, so these states of the Agents are distinct \noffices held by certain souls who carry out important work for each Saheb-e-Zaman. On the \ndeath of one Agent, his office is automatically filled by a successor. For just as there is \nalways a Saheb-e-Zaman or a Saheb-e-Waqt, so there are always his Agents. \n\"Baba explains that there are three types of Agent: \n1. Direct Agents, who are very few. There is one in Europe, one in Asia, one in America, one \nin Africa - one in fact on almost every important continent. These Direct Agents receive \ninstructions directly from the Saheb-e-Zaman. \n2. Indirect Agents, who are few, and who receive instructions from the Direct Agents. \n3. Borrowed Agents, who are many, and who receive orders from the Indirect Agents. \n\"The principal Agents are always on the fourth plane, and through the powers that they \nwield on this plane, they act for the Saheb-e-Zaman. They may even do miracles for the \nSaheb-e-Zaman, since the Saheb-e-Zaman himself almost never performs miracles. For if he \nwishes to do so, he must, at the time of doing the miracle, actually station himself on the \nfourth plane. These Agents are on the fourth plane only because of the necessity of using \ncertain of its powers for the work of the Saheb-e-Zaman. They are not in the position of \nthose on the spiritual Path, who when they reach the fourth plane may use its powers for \ngood, or may misuse them, and so fall back to a very primitive state of evolution.\" \nWilliam Donkin, from notes dictated by Meher Baba \nbefore 1948, W p373 \n*Now partitioned into India and Pakistan. \n\"Meher Baba distributes the 7000 members of the functio ning hierarchy for a particular \nage in and between the seven spiritual planes as follows: \n\"In the first plane, and also between 1st and 2nd, between 2nd and 3rd, between 3rd and \n4th, between 4th and 5th, between 5th and 6th, and between 6th and 7th ..... 5600 \nIn the second plane .. 666 \nIn the third plane ..... 558 \nIn the fourth plane .... 56 \nIn the fifth plane ...... 56 \nIn the sixth plane ...... 56 \nIn the seventh plane (i.e. Majzoobs in the body) .. 3 \nPerfect Masters (Sadgurus) ... 5 \n_____ \n7000 \nThe Avatar, in the 11th age of each cycle, brings the number to 7001 \n\"There are always, at all times and in all ages, 56 God-realised souls or Shiv-Atmas in human \nform on earth. And out of these 56, only eight have public recognition and function as active \nmembers of the functioning spiritual hierarchy, consisting of 7000 members, who do the \nassigned spiritual duties on various planes of consciousness according to their spiritual \nadvancement or Perfection. \n\"The remaining 48 God-realised ones are not amongst the functioning spiritual hierarchy of \n7000 members. They remain aloof, and people are not cognizant of their divinity, though all \n48 have the same experience and enjoy the same divine state of 'I am God' as the other \neight. These 48 are, as it were, on the waiting list ready to help in any spiritual contingency \ncropping up through one or more of the functioning members dropping the body. \n\"Out of the eight God-realised souls who are at the head of the functioning spiritual \nhierarchy of 7000 members, five are Perfect Masters who, besides having a wide public \nrecognition, have a duty to perform in the rendering of spiritual service and benefit to the \nwhole of mankind. The remaining three are Majzoobs who, in spite of having achieved \nGodhood and remaining in the physical body, have no spiritual duty to perform towards \nmankind. Yet they are the source of spiritual benefit to all who come into contact with them. \n\"So it could be said that whereas the five Perfect Masters render spiritual service to \nhumanity as a whole, the few who come into contact with and serve the three Majzoobs \ndraw spiritual benefit from them, while the 48 God-realised ones keep aloof from \nrecognition and function, until a gap is created in the functioning hierarchy by one or more \nof the eight God-realised ones dropping the physical body.\" \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1955, GS p272-274 \nNote: These 7000 members of the functioning spiritual hierarchy are only a tiny percentage \nof spiritually advanced souls: \n\"There are always and eternally 84 lakhs* of souls who experience Subtle experiences. \nAmong them there are seven who are the chiefs, and can experience the Mental world in the \nsame Subtle body. These seven have duty. The 84 lakhs of Subtle experiencers are existing \neven today. The figure is always constant. \n\"There are an equal number who experience the Mental world. But in each new unwinding, \none of the seven chiefs with duty becomes less, meaning he gets no normal consciousness \nnor duty. How many out of the seven chiefs get duty in the Subtle? Seven. In the Mental, six \nhave duty. In the God-state, five.\" \nMeher Baba, 17 May 1943, Meherabad, LM8 p2884 \n*A lakh is 100,000, so 84 lakhs is 8,400,000. If there are 84 lakhs of Subtle-conscious souls, \nand 84 lakhs of Mental-conscious souls, that adds up to 16,800,000 souls on the Subtle and \nMental planes. Only 7000 are members of the functioning spiritual hierarchy (in Avataric \nperiods, 7001). \nFor more about the spiritual hierarchy, see the chapter AGENTS in Book One and Book Two, \nalso Wa p343 and GS p271-274. \nThe Spiritual Hierarchy Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "SPIRITUAL PRACTICES \nMeher Baba \nBe mentally free and happy. \nAs is the cause, so is the effect. The cause may be big and important, or small and \ninsignificant. But the result will definitely be according to the cause. \nThe woes of this world are imaginary, and are the self-created result of our own ignorance. \nHaving no cause, they are therefore unjustifiable. \nIf there is no reason or cause, then it naturally follows that the result is unreal, insubstantial \nand meaningless. So why worry about the happiness or misery of this world, which has no \ncause behind it except imagination? \nJust go on observing things as a passive spectator as they go on around you, keeping the \nmind free and happy. As Hafez says, \n'Both the happiness and sorrows of this world will pass away, so it is better to always \nremain peaceful.' \nOctober 1922, \nBombay, \nLM2 p439-440 \nHuman excrement is totally useless. Only swine eat it. Similarly, when the flesh is cut from a \ncarcass, only bones remain, and these are thrown to the dogs. \nMan's mind is like flesh, and his body is like the bones. We eat flesh (meat) and digest it, \nwhich means we use it. But the bones are inedible and of no use. So we give them to dogs, \nwho can chew and utilise them. We, as men, must care for our minds, which are like the \nmeat. We should use our minds by training them to flow into the proper channels. \nWe have to drop these physical bodies sometime, for they cannot be preserved. To illustrate \nthis: suppose one's finger is chopped off, or a leg is crippled. We should not worry or weep \nover it, because we know that this whole physical body has to be discarded one day. But we \nshould be most careful about our minds, which are of the utmost use to us. The mind should \nbe directed toward proper spheres. It should be kept in check and utilised. \nIf this body, which we have to discard one day, is used for anything, it should be used in the \nservice of three causes: God, the Master, and our fellow man. The body may become weary \nand worn out, it may bring us suffering, but so what? Man, as a physical being, is destined to \nsuffer. So long as the body is vibrant, active and under our control, man can be said to have \nused it for a good cause by directing his energies in any good or noble work. \n2 July 1925, \nMeherabad, \nto a group of Parsi politicians \nAw 22:1 p51 \nAnother version: LM2 p729 \n(Meher Baba and his Mandali were all vegetarian at this time, so the analogy of meat-eating \nmay have been directed at the Parsi visitors.) \nThe whole universe is full of bliss. In fact, nothing really exists except bliss. But ordinary \nmortals cannot achieve it, and they run after material happiness, trying to extract pleasure \nout of the world by acquiring possessions. Man tries one pleasure after another, but all fade \naway, and he is never satisfied. When he is fed up with one, he tries another. When that one \nproves distasteful, something else is tried, and so on. For ages on end, mortal beings have \ntried in vain, birth after birth, to gain happiness from the world. \nBut where is this bliss found? What is man to do if all his efforts are in vain, even after ages? \nHow is he to find real bliss? Only the Sadgurus and Avatars enjoy this divine bliss. \nIf you need something, then you have to approach the person who has it. Similarly, to \nacquire this bliss, one must go to those who have it, and who continuously experience and \nenjoy it - the Realised Perfect ones. Only they can give it to you, and you must remain with \nthem to attain that bliss. \nSatsang (the company) of these Perfect ones is the best medium and path to the attainment \nof bliss. By the grace of the Sadguru, you can gain this bliss in a moment. So the Master's \ngrace is essential, but you have to earn it by staying with him and serving him with all your \nheart. \nThese Realised personalities are of two kinds: Saliks or Sadgurus, and Majzoobs or Brahmi-\nbhoots. Both are Realised and enjoy perfect bliss; but outwardly there is a vast difference \nbetween these two types. The Majzoobs, though God-realised, go about in rags, or are \ncompletely naked. They remain in dirty surroundings and are oblivious of the world and of \npeople, to whom they appear to be crazed beggars. On the other hand, Saliks and Sadgurus, \nthough fully God-realised, act just like ordinary mortals. They eat, drink, sleep, talk and \nappear to suffer like any other ordinary man. \nBut how can you recognise them? Among a hundred thousand so-called saints, there may be \nonly one who is real. What is the test? The best test is to have his company. Maintain your \nconnection with him; stay with him. Then you can know him, and even, in your own limited \nway, judge him by your standards, understanding him to some degree. \nFor example, there are two glasses full of water. One glass contains a little salt in it. But how \ncan you know which is which? For that, you have to taste the water, and only then are you \nable to know the difference. Similarly, by keeping the close company with a so-called saint \nor Master, you will come to know who is real and who is false. \nQ. But how can we acquire the desire for the company of saints? \nBaba: By killing all desires except one: longing for real bliss. Thus only by longing for bliss \nwill you have the chance to come in contact with a Perfect Master, and then, as I said before, \nhis sahavas, his contact and his service will do the rest. You will gain real bliss. \nQ. But how do we earn that opportunity? All of us cannot think of God and have the intense \ndesire for real bliss. \nBaba: Naturally, this depends on one's sanskaras. There is a course of experience through \nwhich every being must pass to realise God. \nSuppose an ordinary person, who has no thought of God or desire for real bliss, gives \nsomething to charity out of his philanthropic nature and feelings for the poor. This is a good \ndeed, and due to that and his mercy for those suffering, he is helped inwardly and \nprogresses. \nHis kind and generous mentality enables him to progress further and further, until a time \ncomes when the desire for real bliss is created. The desire for bliss is born in him \nautomatically. This desire leads him to a Sadguru, and by thus reaching the original source \nof everything, he is eventually able to attain bliss. But before achieving this state of being \nable to create a desire for real bliss, he has to pass through a succession of experiences, both \ngood and bad. \nIn fact, there is nothing such as happiness and misery, virtue and vice, or good and bad. Only \nbliss exists. The experiences of happiness, misery, virtue, vice, good and bad are nothing. \nBut they are the necessary stepping-stones on the course to higher things, which, though \nillusory, everyone has to pass through. \nOnly the Sadguru can alter, divert or destroy this course. That is, he can change the course \nof a person's destiny. This automatically occurs once a person comes in contact with such a \nMaster. Unless all the experiences and sanskaras of this course are wiped out totally, there \nis no chance of Realisation for the disciple; and only a Perfect Master can do that. \nThere are five types of men: \nThose who are water-diviners \nThose who know the water-diviners \nThose who use a machine to test for water \nThose who begin digging a well, and \nThose who, in order to drink water, find a well. \nThe water-diviners are the Perfect Masters and God-realised beings. They know that water \n(love) will be found in a particular area, and they lead others to the spot. \nThose who know the water-diviners are their disciples and lovers, and they eventually find \nwater by following the instructions of the water-diviners, whose knowledge is sure. \nThere are others who rely on machines (their minds) to try and find water. \nStill others begin digging a well with no test at all - first in one place and then in another - \nfollowing one master and then another from place to place. \nStill others do not even begin to search for water. They only drink water when they find it in \na well; in other words, they don't even try to look for it. \nTherefore, to be sure to strike water (gain true love and knowledge), find the water-diviner, \nwho is certain to lead you to it, and stick to him. \n(Someone asked about yoga) \nBaba: The state that comes from yoga is like a state of intoxication. It is like a drunken man \nwhose thoughts have no sum or substance. So create the longing and have the thirst, all the \ntime thinking, 'O God, when will I meet you, when will I meet you?' And to have such thirst, \ncreate love. \n21 August 1929, \nDhulia, \nLM4 p1202-1204 \nI must ask all aspirants to remember once and for all, that if they are desirous of rapid \nprogress and quick enlightenment, they should live up to the following four laws: \n1. If possible, observe celibacy. If already married, keep as little sexual intercourse with \nyour partner as possible. Consider, if you are a man, all other women as your sisters; if you \nare a woman, all other men as your brothers. \n2. Avoid all animal food, except milk and the products of milk. Don't partake of even eggs. \n3. Avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea is not an intoxicant, provided it is weak.  But \nbe moderate in your habit of tea drinking. \n4. Curb yourself, and never give way to anger. Whenever you fly into a passion, you contract \nred sanskaras, which are the worst of all. \nMeher Baba, \nMs 2:2 p8 (February 1930) \nMeditation, repetition of God's name, and spiritual practices in themselves have no \nmeaning. While meditating, any thought comes. Compared to these, my service and my \nsahavas are better, for they contain the seed of love, and only love is required. \n11 February 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1268 \nsahavas = company \nRemember me before starting and after finishing any work. Think of me before doing \nanything. If you have to write something, remember me before starting, and then mentally \nsay 'Baba, it is you, not I, who is writing.' \nMeher Baba, \n30 March 1930, \nNasik, \nLM4 p1293 \nQ. Could you show us some means to overcome our weaknesses and faults? \nBaba: By selfless service, devotion and love. By utilising our best in the service of others. By \nremaining in the world, and yet not being of it. \nQ. What about a person who is so engaged in various activities that he does not know which \nactivity is more important, and which to give up? At such times one worries, even if the \nintention is good. \nBaba: But one must not worry at all. Doing your duties selflessly, try to go beyond the \nlimitations of the intellect. Thirst for divine inspiration and experience of infinite \nconsciousness. Merge in the ocean of divinity. \nQ. How can I attain such a state? \nBaba: By doing selfless service, thus developing a pure character with devotion and love for \nGod. \nto Mr. Vivian, \n29 September 1931, \nLondon, \nLM4 p1439 \nOne must sincerely try to do his duties. But the results must always be left with God. \nWorrying about the results is no good and of no use. \nIf a person wishes to do anything for others, he must do it sincerely. And having done it, he \nshould not worry about the results, for results are not in human hands. It is for humans to \ndo, but for God to ordain. \nTo remain aloof from results is not difficult, but men do not try. Because it is human nature \nto think of the results of one's actions, however, it does not mean one should worry. Man \nmust think, but he must not worry. Try to attribute all your acts to God, and let results be \nhis. \n25 April 1934, \nBangalore, \nLM5 p1866 \nPilu Satha (about her sister Shirin): She works very hard. Since our mother died years ago, \nand we were all so young, Shirin has looked after all of us brothers and sisters, brought us \nup, and managed everything in the house. \nBaba: Working for and serving others, and undergoing so much strain, is very good. It wipes \nout past karmas, and even the new sanskaras which are created are very faint. So it is of \ntremendous spiritual benefit to work, serve, and undergo hardships for others. Sitting idle \nand always eating ready-cooked, served meals, without lifting a finger to help, is very bad \nspiritually. It creates very deep sanskaras which are difficult to wipe away. \n16 May 1934, \nMeherabad, \nLM5 p1869 \nI would like some of you to nurse and wash lepers - some of you to be merged in meditation \non me - some as mendicants - some gay - some thin as skeletons - some big and fat - but all \nto work for me. It is your doing it for me that counts. Otherwise we have hospitals and \nnurses to call upon. But I want you to work for me, beg for me, write for me, meditate on me. \nWhen you think of those lepers as Baba, you wash with love. Baba is in all, so if you wash a \nleper with the same love as you wash my hair, then only do you express the St. Francis state. \nIf you dance for me, you do as much good as one who meditates on me. Some like work, \nsome like play, but when you work for me, play for me, then it is the same. This is Vedanta \nand Christian philosophy in a nutshell. So very easy, yet so very difficult. Ramakrishna used \nto say to the Mother (meaning God), 'I lay all my sins and virtues at your feet.' Virtue and sin \nboth bind. Both are fetters. Be they of gold or iron, both bind. \nEat, dance, but forget yourself in the action and have me instead. This is action.  When you \n(ego) go away entirely, I am one with you. So bit by bit, you have to go. Today your nose, \ntomorrow your ear, then your eyes, your hands, everything. So better think of me when you \neat, sleep, see and hear. Enjoy everything, but think it is all Baba. Baba enjoys it. Baba is \neating it. Sleep soundly in Baba, and when you wake up, remember it is Baba getting up. The \none thought will do. If you get a pain, then think it is Baba getting a pain. Then it will be all \nthe time Baba... \nTry to forget yourself and do all as Baba, and you will enjoy what you do. It is all bliss, all \nlove. It is we who have created misery. \n2 April 1937, \nNasik, \nAw 10:2 p17-18 \nIf you don't want to be old before you really ought to be old, be cheerful in thought, word, \ndeed and appearance - most of all in appearance. Maybe you are not happy inside, perhaps \ngas in your stomach. But you must look happy. I always find half of you garlic-faced. When \nyou eat garlic, it is a smell passed on to all. So when you appear garlic-faced, that too is \ncontagious. It is a divine art to always look cheerful, it is a divine quality. It helps others. \nWhen you are garlic-faced, it makes others unhappy. \n1930s, India, LA p239 \nCommenting on the statement, \"Finding God is the eternal problem and struggle,\" Baba \nexplained: \nIt is true. But one must not stop there and make no efforts, taking that problem as \nimpossible to solve, and feeling despondent, give it up. That search and struggle must \ncontinue, with added vigor and enthusiasm at every step, and the longing developed so \nintensely that it becomes one's only problem in life. To that end, one should struggle, \nmoving on and on, and try to find all sources of enlightenment in the solution of this. \nThe best, easiest, quickest way is to find a Master who has realised God. Although that is not \neasy at all, and one may have to come across many false and fake ones before he finds the \nreal one. But if the longing for that eternal search is kept up, he will come across one who \nwill guide him right to the goal. \nEven those living in the company with a Master should not feel content and say that they \nhave found everything because they have found a living Master. For even though it is a true \nstatement, it lacks actual experience. And experience can never be had without effort. So try, \nall of you, to see your Master as he really is, and not as he appears to you. And even in your \nMaster, try to find that infinite experience that pervades everywhere. \n1939, \nIndia, \nTr p237-238 \nAll the meditations, yogas, concentrations do not teach what Baba teaches you through \neveryday living. That is, to be kind to those who ill-treat you, and to love those you dislike. \nThis is the highest practice of yoga. \nWhen Christ was mocked, spat upon and beaten, he did not use his powers, but he retaliated \nwith love. You should be glad of an opportunity to be mistreated by others. You should \nthank them for the opportunity of suffering and loving. \nThe purpose of your being with Baba is to eliminate the ego. \nbefore June 1939, T p94 \nRemember that the first step in spirituality is not to speak ill of others. \nAll human beings have weaknesses and faults. Yet they are all God in their being. Until they \nbecome Realised, they have their imperfections. \nTherefore, before trying to find faults in others and speaking ill of them, try to find your \nown weaknesses, and correct those. \n27 January 1940, \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2506 \nFor most persons, spiritual sadhana (practice) consists in the external observance of the \nrituals and the ceremonies prescribed by their own religion. Such observance has, at the \ninitial stages, its own value as a factor which contributes towards self-purification and \nmental discipline. But ultimately the aspirant has to transcend the phase of external \nconformity, and get initiated into the deeper aspects of spiritual sadhana. When this \nhappens, the external aspect of religion falls into the background, and the aspirant gets \ninterested in the essentials revealed in all the great religions. True sadhana consists in a life \nwhich is based upon spiritual understanding; and it comes to a person who is really keen \nabout spiritual realities. \nSadhana must never be regarded as consisting in the application of rigid laws. In life there \ncannot be, and need not be, strict and unrelieved uniformity. In the spiritual field there is \nample room for the diversity of sadhanas. The sadhana which is useful for a particular \naspirant is bound to be relative to his sanskaras (impressions) and temperament, and so, \nalthough the spiritual goal for all is the same, the sadhana of the aspirant may be peculiar to \nhimself. However, since the goal is the same for all, the differences with regard to sadhana \nare not of vital importance; and the deeper aspects of sadhana have importance for all the \naspirants, in spite of their differences... \nIn its deeper aspects, spiritual sadhana consists in treading the Path of Knowledge (Dnyana \nMarga), the Path of Action (Karma Marga), and the Path of Love or Devotion (Bhakti \nMarga)... \nThere is a beautiful story of a Kasturi-mriga which brings out the nature of all spiritual \nsadhana: \nOnce, while roaming about and frolicking among hills and dales, the Kasturi-mriga was \nsuddenly aware of an exquisitely beautiful scent, the like of which it had never known. The \nscent stirred the inner depths of its soul so profoundly that it determined to find the source. \nSo keen was its longing that, notwithstanding the severity of cold or the intensity of \nscorching heat, by day as well as by night, it carried on its desperate search for the source of \nthe sweet scent. It knew no fear or hesitation, but undaunted went on its elusive search, \nuntil at last, happening to lose its foothold on a cliff, it had a precipitious fall, resulting in a \nfatal injury. \nWhile breathing its last, the deer found that the scent which had ravished its heart and \ninspired all these efforts came from its own navel. This last moment of the deer's life was \nthe happiest, and there was on its face inexpressible peace. \nAll spiritual sadhana of the aspirant is like the efforts of the Kasturi-mriga. \nThe final fructification of sadhana involves the termination of the ego-life of the aspirant. \nBut at that moment there is the realisation that he himself has, in a sense, been the object of \nall his search and endeavor, and that all that he suffered and enjoyed, all his risks and \nadventures, all his sacrifices and desperate strivings, were intended for having true self-\nknowledge, in which he loses his limited individuality, only to discover that he is really \nidentical with God, who is in everything. \n1943? \nIndia? \nDi v5 p36-44 \nFor more on sadhana, see the article these passages are drawn from in Discourses: Di v5 \np36-44, or Di (7th ed.) p258-265. \nThe following instructions, if carried out wholeheartedly by you, will allow you to help my \nwork of spiritualising the world. They are not to be treated like long-established sermons, \nread, heard and forgotten. They are not to be understood in the light of philosophical \nslogans preached merely for the sake of preaching. They are simple, eternal truths, which I \nwant all of you to try your utmost to live. The instructions are: \n1. Amidst all your duties and attachments, let the background of all your thoughts be only \nthe one thought that 'God alone is real, and all else is illusion.' \n2. Infuse into others the idea that the ultimate goal of all life is to know God in his true, \ninfinite aspect. \n3. Think less of yourself and more of others by trying to make others happy, even if you \nhave to suffer for it. \n4. Learn for yourself, and teach others, that the recognition of God's will means not to \ncomplain of your lot; that control of the mind means not to be upset by misfortunes; that \nloving all as children of the same one God means not to be jealous of anyone, and not to hurt \nthe feelings of anyone. \nNow listen very carefully: The period of one month beginning from May 15th 1943, and \nending on June 14th 1943, is the most important period of my spiritual mission. During this \nwhole month, I want every one of you to follow literally the following: \n1. Observe strict celibacy, even if you are married. \n2. Do not attend cinemas. \n3. Do not go to theaters and concerts. \n4. Do not attend parties. \n5. Avoid entertainments. \n6. The first thing every morning is to say a sincere prayer from you to God to make you \nunderstand him and his will: \n'God make me understand you and your will.'\" \n15 May 1943, \nMeherabad, \nwritten instructions to 125 men, \nLM8 p2783-2784 \nThe deeper secrets of the spiritual life are unveiled to those who take risks and make bold \nexperiments with life. They are not intended for the weak-kneed who seek guarantees for \nevery step. \nbefore 1948, Av p278 \nA young woman asked Baba how she could serve others. Baba told her, \n\"Those who really know, know they do not have to do anything.\" \nJuly 1952, \nNew York, \nAw 14:2 p18 \nAs soon as we make others happy, then God knows about it immediately and is pleased. No \namount of prayer and meditation, or artis you can say, will please God...  He is deaf to that. \nBut when you help others or serve others at the cost of your own happiness, immediately \nGod knows and hears your actions, your activities, and is pleased... \nWhen you become one with God, the bliss that you experience is eternal, infinite.  There is \nno break in that bliss. It is continual. And then you can make others happy. You get the \nauthority to make others happy. \nThe only thing that I have been repeating ever since the first time I came is love God. Age \nafter age I have been saying nothing but love God.  Love - everyone now uses the word love. \nIt has been made so very cheap. If one really loves, one would never utter that word. What \ndoes it mean to love God? It is a very, very great thing. The true lover of God never says \nanything. He forgets that he loves God. \nHow will you love God? How should you love God? Not through meditations, not through so-\ncalled prayers or other things. There are two ways. One is to leave all and everything. That \nmeans to have nothing of your own, not even your body... to renounce absolutely \neverything. Everything means not only your surroundings, but everything, including \nyourself. \nThe second thing is something great. There you don't have to renounce anything. You can \nlead a family life, be in the world, do your work or business, attend your services, attend \ntheatres, parties, everything. But always do one thing. Constantly think, constantly try to \nmake others happy, even at the cost of your own happiness. That is the second way of loving \nGod. \n21 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p22, 24-25 \nChrist said, 'Leave all and follow me.' What did he mean by that? He didn't mean leave the \nbody, food, sleep and all that. No - he meant leave all thoughts of possessions, all worldly \nthoughts, and think only of him. \nThink of me to such an extent that you see me, however far away I may be. You see my body \nhere now. However far away my body may be, you will be able to see me physically also. In \nIndia, some love me to such an extent that they see me physically present, although I am \nthousands of miles away from them. \n22 July 1956, \nNew York, \nAw 4:2 p30-31 \n\"Ceremonies and rituals have no importance. Love holds the key. Duties must be \ndischarged, but at the back of the mind, always think that all is illusion, and Baba is the only \nreality.\" \nMeher Baba, \n1960, \nPoona, \nAw 22:1 p39 \nA man who was visiting Baba told him that he wanted to stay with him for a month in Poona \nin order to do 'seva,' (service) for Baba. Baba told him: \n\"What service will you do here? Spreading my message of love is my service. If you stay \nhere, on the contrary, I will have to do your seva, as I will have to look after your health, \nfood, clothes, etc. Besides, in Poona there are more fellows who can talk about my message \nof love than there are listeners. \n\"Real value of service is when there is an opposition to it. Your contact with me brings many \ndifficulties to you. Still, if you hold on to my daaman, it is creditable. When you have no food \nto eat, no money in your pockets, and still you do my service, then it is real service. \n\"Your very life should be a standing example to others. Love should not be external, and \nthere should be no show about it. External love means observing silence, fasts, etc. Some \nsick persons are not allowed food for a long time, but this does not mean they have love for \nGod. Carry on your worldly duties, but think that Baba is behind everything.\" \nBaba asked the man to return to his town, and at parting told him, \"Take me with you. Don't \nworry.\" \n1960, \nPoona, \nAw 22:1 p66 \nAlso see the chapters PRAYER, MEDITATION, and FOLLOWING MEHER BABA in Book One \nand Book Two. \nFor more about spiritual practices, see ''The Deeper Aspects of Sadhana,' Di v5 p38-44 (in \nthe 7th edition, p258-265). Sadhana  means spiritual practice or effort toward the goal of \nconscious union with God. \nFor more about service, see 'Readiness to Serve' in the chapter QUALIFICATIONS in Book \nOne.

    "text": "SPIRITUALITY \nMeher Baba \nQ. What is real spirituality? \nBaba: Spirituality is a thing to be experienced and lived. It makes you firm like a rock. \nNeither worldly sorrows nor pleasures upset you. You attain the state where no desires \nremain, and you want nothing. When you do not want anything, you have everything. \nLook at this mast, Chatti Baba. He is so innocent, so loving, so happy always, for the simple \nreason that he wants nothing. And strange as it may sound, he has everything - happiness, \ncontentment, and eternal peace of mind. \nThe state of desirelessness, or of wanting nothing, is a faculty that is latent in everyone. It is \nwithin you and you must discover it. I have found it and continually experience it. I know \nthat this faculty is in everyone, but being latent, it has to be found and experienced. The \ndifference between you and me is, although both of us have this faculty, I actually \nexperience and feel it, while you have yet to do so. I see myself in you all, as you see all these \nmaterial things with your eyes. It is a fact for me. \nWith your Gross eyes, you see everything external. Behind this external aspect, there is not \nmerely a spaceless void, but also pure nothingness. When you experience this pure \nnothingness, you will see how it has come out of the Everything - and this Everything is \nwithin you. When this experience is gained, the faculty of wanting nothing is developed, and \nyou begin to experience it. \nRemember that the first step in spirituality is not to speak ill of others. All human beings \nhave weaknesses and faults. Yet they are all God in their being. Until they become Realised, \nthey have their imperfections. Therefore, before trying to find faults in others and speaking \nill of them, try to find your own weaknesses, and correct those. \n27 January 1940, Bangalore, LM7 p2506 \nWhat is spirituality? It is the undoing of what you have been doing since ages. You always \nthought of selfish motives of eating, preserving your life, and for that every need, attending \nto it with zeal. All these lives you have made a habit of looking to yourself. If the slightest \nthing goes against your habit you are upset. \nNow, to undo all these selfish bindings, you have to do what you have not been doing, or not \nto do what you have been doing. What you have been doing always is thinking of yourself; \nso now you must not think of yourself but think of others. This is what is called love. But it \nneeds character, poise, perseverance. \nPoise -- what is poise? That state of mind where nothing excites you, nothing upsets you; \nthen only can you help others, then only can you make others happy. That means love. \nThinking not of yourself but of others. \nIf you are in the Sahara and for four days you have no water to drink, and all of a sudden \none bottle of water appears, how do you react?  If you have poise, you will let your \ncompanion drink and not mind dying and letting her live. But, if you fight and grab for it, \nyou lack poise and spirituality. \nIt is this poise that makes you sacrifice and makes others happy. For example, I always say: \nmake the most of everything. Here you have food, swimming, boating. Make the most of it \nand feel happy. Do not say it is not spiritual to enjoy innocent pleasures. But when we are \ndriving on tour and there is dust and we feel hunger, thirst, and feel sick, then feel as happy \nas you do now. This is poise. If you do not feel happy -- it is not easy to feel happy then \n(under these conditions) -- you are not spiritual in enjoying this swimming, boating etc. -- is \nthis clear? I do not mean making a show of being happy, but to really feel happy. \nFor you, my Circle, it is all right. You live with me, leave all to me, so you are serving the \nuniverse. But for those who are not living here near me, this poise is 100% essential for \nspirituality. \nAgain, what is spirituality? Poise, perfect poise. Make the most of every situation. \nApril 1940, Karwar, LA p285-286 \nAnother version (re-edited): LM7 p2544 \n... From the spiritual point of view, the only important thing is to realise the divine life, and \nhelp others to realise it, by manifesting it in the everyday happenings. \nTo penetrate into the essence of all being and significance, and to release the fragrance of \nthat inner attainment for the guidance and benefit of others, by expressing, in the world of \nforms, truth, love, purity and beauty - this is the sole game which has any intrinsic and \nabsolute worth. All other happenings, incidents and attainments can, in themselves, have no \nlasting importance. \nc.1940, Di v3 p34 \nAnother version: Di (7th ed.) p200, IS p113 \nWhat is wrong with the world today, and with India in particular? \nSuch and allied questions are bound to arise in thinking minds. But the answers are not \naltogether honest and straight. The diagnosis given and the remedies adopted have all been \nbiased and one-sided. The whole situation stands hopelessly vague and undetermined. \nThe crux of the situation lies in the correct understanding and reinterpreting of the ancient \nword 'religion.' \nThe West has very little of religion, and whenever we hear of it, it is subservient to politics, \nor at best a handmaid of material life. The East is suffering from an overdose of religion, and \nconsequently it is desperately hankering for a material antidote thereto. Religion in the \nWest is synonymous with scientific progress, which is destructive in its  manifestation. In \nthe East, and particularly in India, religion, instead of establishing the kingdom of God on \nEarth, has gone underground in the guise of crude ceremonies, rude rituals, and dead \ndogmas. \nInstead of engendering the seeds of peace and plenty, the under-driven religion tries to \nshoot out communalism, fanaticism, nationalism and patriotism, which have become \nbywords for leadership and greatness, suffering and sanctity. In short, religion, as a living \nforce, has become obsolete. The urgent need of today, to rescuscitate religion, is to dig it out \nof its narrow and dark hidings and coverings, and let the spirit of man shine out once again \nin its pristine glory. \nThe most practical thing to do in the world is to be spiritually-minded. It needs no special \ntime, place or circumstances. It is not necessarily concerned with anything out of the way of \nanyone's daily life and day-to-day routine. It is never too late or too early to be spiritual. It is \njust a simple question of having a right attitude of mind toward lasting values, changing \ncircumstances, avoidable eventualities, and a sense of the inevitable. \nSpirituality is neither restricted to, nor can it be restricted by, anyone or anything, \nanywhere, at any time. It covers all life for all time. Yet it can very easily be achieved with \nselfless service and pure love that know no bondage and seek no boundaries. A mighty \nsurge of this spirituality is about to sweep over the world. My blessings to you all. \n3 April 1947, Madras, LM9 p3159 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

But the help of the Sadguru is needed in order to know and experience \nGod. \nOnce in the jungle, a tigress died after giving birth to a cub. The cub remained hungry, \nwithout food or water for days. A shepherd found it and took pity on it. He reared it among \nhis sheep. The cub grew up thinking he was a sheep. He did not know he was a tiger. \nOne day a grown-up tiger saw the cub playing among the flock and was surprised. He went \nto the cub and did his utmost to persuade it that it was a tiger and not a sheep. But the \nyoung tiger would not believe him. So the tiger took him to a pool of water and made him \nlook at his own reflection there. The young tiger was astonished and at last was convinced \nof his true identity. He forgot the notion of his being a lamb, and passed the rest of his days \namong tigers. \nIn this story the sheep represent worldly people who are ignorant of the Truth. The flock of \nsheep represents the general public. The tiger cub is an ignorant man. The full-grown tiger \nis the Sadguru. The pool of water symbolises the Path, and recognising the reflection is \nattaining God-realisation. \nAlthough the tiger cub was a tiger, out of ignorance he took himself to be a sheep. And as \nlong as the other tiger did not show him his reflection in the pool of water, this \nmisconception continued. In the same way, though man is potentially God, being quite \nignorant of his real self, he thinks himself to be only a man, and passes through cycles of \nbirths and deaths. He continues wallowing in ignorance until the Sadguru makes him see his \nown true image. \n20 December 1928, \nMeherabad, \nto the boys in his school, \nLM3 p1128 \nBack to top",

    "text": "THE TREASURY OF SUGAR \nTHE TREASURY OF SUGAR \nThe spiritual Path is not a bed of roses. After fourteen years of fasting, the great yogi Farid \nShakkar Ganje had reached the fourth plane, but only knew how to kill sparrows. Once a \nSadguru was sitting in the shade of a tree observing him. Seeing the birds, Farid said, 'Let all \nthe sparrows drop dead.' Instantly all the sparrows were dead. Then Farid, by his command, \nmade them come alive again. The Sadguru taunted him: 'That is nothing. Learn Fakiri - \ncontrol over yourself.' \nOnce Farid found an old woman lowering a bucket into a well, and drawing it back up again \nempty. This happened several times, and he expressed his surprise. The old woman, who \nwas a saint on the fifth plane, replied, 'It is better than your commands of die and come \nalive.' Hearing this, Farid Ganje was awakened to the reality of his powers, and began \nsearching for a Master. He found one, and by the Master's grace, became a Perfect Master \nhimself. \n10 December 1928, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1126 \nEven those in the fifth plane find it difficult to keep away from Illumination. It is called the \nstate of Hairat in Sufism. When the soul sees the Infinite, it has Illumination. Now, to work in \nthe world for others, this soul must at times keep away from Illumination, but finds it very, \nvery difficult. \nOne famous Wali (in the fifth plane) named Ganjay Shakkar found it very difficult to obey \nhis Master, the Khwaja of Ajmer. Then the Master turned the key. Five thieves who had \nstolen a lot came to where that Wali was staying. That Wali could not close his eyes. They \nwere always open, dazed, glassy. He would not eat. These thieves stood five paces away \nfrom the Wali. They sat down and began sharing their loot, and soon were quarreling \namong themselves. Then two of them killed the other three. Then these two took all the loot \nand were going away with it. They passed by where the Wali was sitting, and as soon as they \ncame near he regained normal consciousness. \nThe moment he opened his eyes, he saw sparrows. He wanted to try his powers, and said, 'O \nsparrows, die,' and the sparrows fell down dead. Then he said, 'O sparrows, rise up,' and \nthey rose. \nThis is a very famous story in India. At Ajmer there is a very big tomb, and every year \nhundreds and thousands go there on pilgrimage. \nThe two thieves were amazed, and asked the Wali to raise the other three. The Wali said, \n'Rise up,' and they wouldn't. Then he went, crying and repentant, to his Master. When he \nwent there, he saw the three thieves massaging the feet of the Master. \nThe Wali went back to his original place. For ten years he did not eat or drink, and became \nvery lean, and white ants were eating his body up. People came every day and placed sugar \naround his body, and the ants used to eat the sugar. From that time on, the Wali was named \nGanjay Shakkar, the Treasury of Sugar, and whenever people go to his tomb, they take sugar \nwith them. \nSo even in the fifth plane, one finds it difficult, and the Master has to bring it around in this \nway. And the fun of it all is that till one attains the seventh plane of consciousness, it is all \nillusion. Just as all this appears real, in the same way, up to the sixth plane it appears real, \nbut it is not real. \n26 December 1936, \nNasik, \nAw 16:2 p16-17 \nAnother version: Di (7th ed.) p 198-199 \nBack to top",

He was in the habit of taking bhang,* and once after \ndrinking some, he went to sell ice cream. \nOn his way there was a small puddle, hardly half a foot wide. But to Kaikhushru that puddle \nwas a lake. He actually ran and jumped ten fee over it in order to cross it. \nNow if you had said to him, 'This is not a lake, but a tiny puddle,' do you think he would have \nbelieved you? He would have called you mad. To him it was a lake. \nSimilarly, to you, all this before you is matter. But to me it is nothing. Just as matter does not \nexist in your sound sleep, so it does not exist in my awake state. What you experience \nunconsiously in the sound sleep state, we God-realised persons experience in the awake \nstate. Our awake state is real. Yours is false. \nWhen you realise God, you will see for yourself. The existence of matter is due to the \nexistence of the mind. When the mind disappears, matter also vanishes. \n28 March 1929, \nMeherabad, \nto his men Mandali, \nLM3 p1148-1149 \n*bhang: hashish mixed in milk \nBaba: Where is heaven and where is hell?

They called to me and made me \nsit near them. I was just a child. One Irani was preparing the Indian bhang, a certain \nconcoction that brings one intoxication. \nThe three were enjoying their drink. One Irani was clever and had known my father, \nSheheriarji. So he called me over and made me sit near him. He had taken a lot to drink, and \nwas telling the others in a lively voice, 'I am in heaven today!' \nI enjoyed their talk. Then he got up, the others also, and they started walking. I knew there \nwas a trickle of water there crossing the road ahead. And, as everyone in India knows, the \nreaction of Indian bhang is such that a drop of water appears to be an ocean. So that \nintoxicated fellow stopped, thinking that there was a big stream right across the road. He \nactually experienced that trickle of water as a big stream, and he wanted to jump over it. He \ntried his best to cross it with a long jump, but he jumped so hard he broke his leg. Then he \ncried, 'Now I am in hell!' \nSo both these heaven and hell states are there, they are experienced, but they don't exist. \nThey are part of maya. \n26 July 1956, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina \nto a group of (mostly) Americans, \nAw 4:3 p37-38 \nBack to top",

A yogi, seeing him thus \nwaiting, came up to him, literally walked across the river and back, and said, 'That was \nmuch easier, was it not?' \nThe Master smilingly replied, 'Yes, and had less value than that of the boat fare - one anna.\" \nc.1954?

Mira loved Krishna with all \nher heart. Her husband did not like the way she was going about on the streets, for she was \nthe queen, and queens did not mix with the crowd. She would enter the huts of the poor, the \nname of Krishna on her lips as she sang. \nShe suffered many trials and threats to test her love for Krishna. She was locked in a room, \nher food was poisoned, a cobra was concealed in a bouquet of flowers. She accepted all as a \ngift of her lord Krishna, and nothing happened, he protected her. She refused to have \nanything to do with anyone but her lord Krishna. \nFinally the king drove her away. She said, 'If the king drives me out, I have a place, but if the \nlord of the universe is displeased, I have no place.' The people turned against her. As years \npassed, she looked radiant in her rags. Then the king came and fell at her feet... because she \nwas sincere.

    "text": "MOSES \nMOSES \nA true aspirant is not content with such knowledge of spiritual realities as might be based \non hearsay. Nor is he satisfied with pure inferential knowledge. For him the spiritual \nrealities are not the object of idle thinking, and the acceptance or the rejection of these \nrealities are both fraught with momentous implications for his inner life. So he naturally \ninsists upon direct knowledge about them. \nThis might be illustrated from the life of a great sage. One day he was discussing spiritual \ntopics with his friend, who was quite advanced upon the Path. While they were thus \nengaged upon this discussion, their attention was diverted to a dead body which was being \ncarried by their side. \n'This is the end of the body, but not of the soul,' his friend remarked. \n'Have you seen the soul?' asked the sage. \n'No,' was the answer of his friend. \nAnd the sage remained skeptical about the soul, for he insisted upon personal knowledge. \nBut though the aspirant cannot be content with second-hand knowledge or mere guesses, \nhe does not close his mind against the possibility of there being such spiritual realities as \nmight not have come within his experience. In other words, he is conscious of the \nlimitations of his own individual experience, and refrains from making it the measure of all \npossibilities. He has an open mind for all things which are beyond the scope of his \nexperience. If he does not accept them on hearsay, he does not also rush to active disbelief \nin them. \nIt is true that the limitation of experience often tends to restrict the scope of the working of \nimagination, and a person comes to believe that there are no realities other than such as \nmay have come within the ken of his past experience. But usually as a result of some \nincidents or happenings in his own life, he may come out of his dogmatic enclosure and \nbecome really open-minded. \nThis stage of transition may also be illustrated from a story from the life of the same sage, \nwho happened to be a prince. \nOnce, some days after the incident of discussion (mentioned above), as he was riding on \nhorseback, he came upon an ordinary pedestrian coming towards him from the opposite \ndirection. Since the way of the horse was thus blocked by the presence of the pedestrian, the \nsage arrogantly ordered him to clear the way for him. The pedestrian refused to clear the \nway for him, and so the sage got down from his horse, and they entered upon the following \nconversation: \n'Who are you?' asked the pedestrian. \n'I am the prince,' answered the sage. \n'But I do not know you to be the prince,' said the pedestrian, and continued, 'I shall admit \nyou as being a prince only when I know you to be a prince, and not otherwise.' \nThis encounter awakened the sage to the fact that God may exist, even though he did not \nknow him from personal experience, just in the same way as he was actually a prince, \nalthough the pedestrian did not know it from his own personal experience. And now that his \nmind was open for considering the possible existence of God, he set himself to the task of \ndeciding that question in right earnest. \n1939? India, \nDi v2 p13-15 \nAlso Di (7th ed.) p123-124 \nLife often presents engimas which cannot be unraveled by ordinary persons. It seems to \nthem to be full of questions which are unanswerable. Unrestrained chaos seems to be the \nlaw of the world, and there appears to be no justice or significance in the march of its \nevents. Even those who believe in God get puzzled, and waver in their faith. \nBut it is only impatience and lack of true vision that are responsible for such an outlook. We \nembrace ignorance, and we fail to see that whatever life brings is charged with great \nmeaning. God's ways are always unchallengable and irresistable, thought they might be \nmysterious and inscrutable. The secrets of his working in the world cannot be truly \nunderstood even by advanced souls. \nThis may be brought out by means of an anecdote of a great saint who is very much \nrespected up to this day in all quarters of the world. \nOnce upon a time this saint encountered an Angel, and requested him for being allowed to \nbe with him in his wanderings on Earth, so that he might understand something of the \nsecret working of God. \nThe Angel at once granted him permission to be with him and observe all his doings on \nEarth. But he laid down his strict condition in the following words. He said, \n'You are only to observe my doings, without at any stage and in any way asking me the \nexplanation for my actions. You would not be able to judge and understand God's ways. \nEven if you are not able to understand them, you must not ask me the why of all that you see \nme do, during the period that you will be allowed to be with me.' \nThe saint promised that he would merely observe, and that he would in no way pester him \nwith any questions, even if such questions arose in his mind. And then he was allowed to \nfollow the Angel in his wanderings on Earth. \nOnce they got into a boat for crossing the sea. The boatman offered his services to them \nwithout charging his usual fare, just because it pleased him to help them. When the boat \nwas in the midst of the ocean, the Angel took off one side-plank from the framework of the \nboat and threw it away in the water. \nThe saint at once got worried, and exclaimed, 'Why are you damaging the boat? Shall we not \nall get drowned, along with the boat?' \nThe Angel reminded him that he had already agreed not to ask him any questions \nwhatsoever, and asked him to remain quiet. \nAfter landing they came upon an Arab youth. To the utter bewilderment of that saint, the \nAngel at once killed that youth on the very spot. Now the saint found it very difficult to \nremain quiet, but asked him in excitement, 'Why did you kill that growing life?' \nOn this, the Angel replied, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to understand God's \nworking? You must keep to your promise that you will not ask any questions' \nThe saint realised that he had failed in fulfilling the condition which he had accepted, and he \nwanted to be excused. \nThen they both came to a village, where they requested the people of the village to give \nthem some food. But the villagers only treated them contemptuously, and drove them away \nwithout giving them alms. \nWhen they came to the outskirts of the village, they saw a dilapidated wall in ruins, which \nwas intended to protect the village from the invasions of enemies. The Angel went to the \nwall and repaired it, spending much of his valuable time. \nThis time, the saint could not contain himself and said, 'Why did you repair that wall for the \nvillagers, who did not even give alms to us? You have done this labor of love for nothing. For \nso much labor in the village, we would easily have got sufficient remuneration to procure \nfood and allay our hunger.' \nAt this, the Angel said, 'You have again asked a question, in spite of your having promised \nmerely to observe and keep quiet. It is no use divulging the secrets of God's ways \nprematurely. It requires the greatness and patience of God to understand his working. You \nhave tried to pry into God's secrets, which you must not divulge. It is now time for us to \npart. But never mind, before we part, I will explain to you the reasons for my deeds.' \nThe Angel then proceeded to give the explanation to the saint. He said, 'The boatman is a \npoor but pious man. When I took away a side-plank of the boat from a prominent place in its \nframework, I knew that a king of robbers was approaching in that direction. This robber-\nking was collecting new and efficient boats to carry on his plunders. And whenever he saw \nany really good boat, he was sure to snatch it away from the owners. He, however, left \nuntouched any boats which were in a broken and dilapidated condition. I took away a huge \nside-plank in order that a the boat might look uninviting. Otherwise the pious and poor \nboatman will be relieved of the only means of his livelihood. \n'Now, the Arab youth whom I killed was most notorious and vicious. If he had lived, he \nwould not only have perpetrated heinous crimes, but would surely have brought upon his \npious parents an agonising blasphemy which they in no way merited. It was the will of \ndivine providence that I should kill this Arab youth in order to save him from further sins, \nand save his pious parents from the suffering of undeserved ill-fame. \n'Now coming to the repairs of the wall. Be it known to you that one pious man has kept \nburied under it his valuable treasure, with a desire that it may be of use to his sons. But it is \nGod's will that his sons must get that treasure when they grow up, and that no one else \nshould get it. If the dilapidated wall had further fallen, the treasure was in danger of being \nexposed to the sight of the wicked villagers, who would surely have taken possession of that \ntreasure for themselves. \n'Rest assured that all I did in the incidents which it was your special privilege to observe, I \ndid, not of my own accord or initiative, but by the orders of our divine father, whose real \ngreatness even we as Angels can only partly understand. God's ways might be inscrutable to \nthe world. But his love for the world is unbounded, and his justice is unfailing.' \nWith these words the Angel parted, leaving the saint in deep contemplation. And the saint \ndecided to live in complete resignation, to accept God's will even when his limited intellect \ncould not understand its real meaning.\" \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \nbefore 1948, ST p61-65 \nBack to top",

    "text": "HAFEZ \nBLESSED OR CURSED? \nA Sadguru once set out with his disciples for begging. He approached a rich merchant, who \ninstead of giving alms, shouted abuses and obscenities. Nevertheless, the Sadguru blessed \nhim, saying, 'Your profits will double.' \nThe Sadguru then approached another wealthier merchant, who mistreated him even more \nbadly. He, however, blessed this man, saying, 'Your profits will quadruple.' \nThen the Sadguru, with his disciples, approached the shop of a poor old man, who received \nthem with reverence, and offered whatever he could provide from his meager store. The old \nshopkeeper had only one son, whom he loved dearly. Before leaving, the Sadguru cursed \nhim: 'By the power of God, I pray that your son dies soon.' The next day the son was found \ndead. \nWhen the Sadguru's disciples found this out, they were bewildered by their Master's \nbehavior. The only man who had received them with humble reverence had been cursed, \nnot blessed. \nAfterward, the Sadguru explained: 'Both merchants were immersed in the mire of \nworldliness, and did not want to be extricated. For that reason, I had to submerge them \neven more in the mire of the world by my blessings, so that one day they will cry to be \npulled out. The poor shopkeeper was spiritually inclined. However his love for his son was \nmuch too binding. It was an obstruction to the old man's progress on the Path. The son was, \nunknowingly, a thorn in his father's side, and so I opened the door to the Path by removing \nhis son. Now you tell me, who was blessed and who was cursed?' \nApril? 1922, \nPoona, to his men Mandali, \nLM2 p361-362 \nNote: The Perfect Master was a Hindu \nBack to top \nHAFEZ \nOne who knows the Koran by heart is called a Hafez. Such a one's heart and soul are \ndedicated to the service and thoughts of God alone... \nHafez was spiritually inclined from an early age, and became the disciple of a Perfect \nMaster, Attar, who himself was a great Persian poet. \nHafez visited Attar every day for many, many years. He wrote ghazals and recited them to \nhis Master. Attar enjoyed these ghazals and gave them to his other disciples to study and \nbenefit by them, saying that Hafez's ghazals would be of the utmost importance to the future \ngenerations. \nHafez himself did not bother to preserve his poems, and it was only after his death that they \nwere collected and put together as a Diwan (treasury or collection). \nOne day, while he was still a youth, Hafez saw a very beautiful woman who came from a \nwealthy family. He instantly fell in love with her - not in the lustful way, but he fell in love \nwith her beauty, as it were. Because of the difference in their positions, he could not \napproach her. Yet he remained intensely in love with this woman for thirty years. He loved \nhis Master, Attar, greatly too, and hoped that Attar would help him in attaining the \ncompanionship of the woman. \nOne day Attar asked Hafez, 'Tell my what you desire.' Hafez said he wanted the woman. \nAttar replied, 'Have patience. You will get her.' \nBut almost ten years more passed by, and Hafez was no nearer having his longing fulfilled. \nHe became utterly disheartened. When alone with Attar one day, he began to weep. When \nthe Master asked him why he was crying, Hafez in his desperation blazed out, 'What have I \ngained after being with you for nearly forty years?' \nAttar answered, 'Have patience. You will know one day.' \nHafez retorted, 'I knew I would get this answer from you.' And exactly forty days before the \nend of his forty years association with Attar, Hafez entered into self-imposed Chehel-a-\nNashini. \nChehel-a-Nashini means drawing a circle on the ground and sitting within it continually for \nforty days. (One who succeeds in going through the Chehel-a-Nashini is supposed to attain \nwhatever he desires). \nIt is almost impossible to to stay for forty days within the limits of a circle without once \nstepping outside it. But Hafez's love was so great that it made it possible for him to go \nthrough this Chehel-a-Nashini without faltering. \nOn the fortieth day his Master appeared to him in the form of an Angel. On seeing such \nbeauty, Hafez realised that the beauty of the woman he desired was as nothing in \ncomparison with this heavenly beauty. And when the Angel asked him what it was he \ndesired most, Hafez replied instantly that his only desire was to wait on the pleasure of his \nMaster's wish. \nJust before dawn broke on the last day, Hafez came out of his Chehel-a-Nashini and went to \nhis Master. His Master embraced him, and Hafez became God-realised... \n\"Now for a Perfect Master to write poetry, what is this, when the whole world is in his \nhands? But as Tukaram, a Hindu Perfect Master who was also a great poet, explained, one's \noriginal nature (i.e. one's original tendencies, likes and dislikes) persist even after God-\nrealisation. So since Hafez was a poet before he attained God-realisation, he continued \nwriting poetry even afterwards. \n1960s? \nIndia? \n'Hafez' by Adi S.

    "text": "A  BOULDER OVER THE BED \nKing Janak was a Videh Mukta, a Sadguru who was physically without sensation or feeling, \nand beyond maya. But, because he was a king, he lived like a king in royal fashion, and his \npalace contained all the comforts and riches befitting a king. \nAn aspirant of the Path came to him one day, sent to Janak by his guru. The pilgrim had \nundergone all sorts of severe austerities, had wandered for years and years, and had fasted \nlong without food and even without water. \nWhen he came to the court of Janak, seeing the pomp and grandeur of the palace, he \nthought, 'How could one living so regal a life give me knowledge? When the king himself is \nenmeshed in maya, how could he ever free others from it?' \nKing Janak asked the pilgrim to rest for the night, and said he would talk with him after a \nfew days. He was given a fine room in the palace with all luxuries. A servant was placed at \nhis disposal, and he was fed the best of food. But at night when he went to sleep, as he lay on \nhis bed, he saw a large boulder suspended over the bed, and it seemed to be slowly \ndescending. He was frightened, and lay awake the whole night looking up at the stone, \nafraid it would fall and crush him. For two days he had no sleep and suffered in health. \nOn the third day Janak sent for him and inquired about him. The man recounted his \nsleepless nights, and the king said, \n'Despite all the conveniences and comforts, you could not sleep and were restless. \nCompared to the hardships you have suffered in your past penance, this experience seems \nto have been much more tormenting, as your mind was all the time concentrated on the \nstone. Outwardly, though you found all splendor and glory, your life is just the same as that \nwhich you have led for years. Although you see me surrounded by the comforts of the \npalace, inwardly I am all the time rooted in God. I am beyond all this, and take others \nbeyond it.' \nThe pilgrim then understood King Janak's state and surrendered to him. \n27 July 1939, \nMeherabad, to Sarosh and Viloo Irani, \nLM7 p2440-2441 \nEmperor Janak, Sita's father, was also known to be a Perfect Master. During his reign, there \nwas a youth from outside his empire who longed desperately to see God. 'I must see him,' he \nsaid, 'as clearly as I see these external things.' And he decided to see Janak and ask his help. \nFor two months he walked through sun and rain without food. This was about 7000 years \nago. There were no automobiles and airplanes then. Finally he arrived at the courtyard of \nJanak's palace. The guards accosted and stopped him. He stood outside the wall, crying \naloud for Janak, shouting his name, his glory and his fame. At last Janak heard him, and \nasked his ministers to inquire who he was. \n'I am a lover of God,' he replied. 'I want to see God. Janak must show me God.' \nJanak had him brought in, and said to his ministers, 'Throw him in prison.' \nAfter a few days, during which the youth had no food nor drink, Janak ordered him to be \nbrought to audience. Janak saluted him with folded hands, and ordered his ministers to give \nhim a bath, to feed him, and to treat him like a prince. He was brought to the palace and \nseated on Janak's throne. 'Let him enjoy this state for three days,' said Janak. \nThe youth did not grasp what Janak had in mind, and of course, he did not know how to \nmanage the affairs of state. Poor people came begging, ministers came for advice. He didn't \nknow what to do, so he kept quiet. Finally he appealed to the ministers to ask Janak to free \nhim from this uncomfortable position. \nJanak came, ordered him to get down from the throne, and asked him what he preferred, life \nin prison, or life on the throne. The boy said, 'They are both prisons, but of different kinds.' \nJanak then directed him to go, and to return after twelve years. \nThe youth left the palace, roamed about India, became a rich man, and took the name of \nKalyan, which means 'happy in every respect.' \nAfter twelve years, he returned to Janak, this time rich and prosperous. The guards again \nchecked him, asking who he was. 'I am the rich Kalyan,' he said. Janak, on hearing this, sent \nword for him to go away for a few more years. So Kalyan returned home, and in the course \nof time lost everything he possessed. \nAfter twelve years he returned to Janak, who again asked who he was. 'I am the miserable \nKalyan,' he replied. Janak then sent him away again for twelve more months. \nDuring this time, Kalyan started pondering. 'What is this? When I first went to Janak, I had \nnothing, but I wanted to see God. Then I was thrown into prison. Then I was placed on the \nthrone. Then I became rich. Then I became poor. What does all this mean?' \nWhen he returned to Janak's palace after twelve months, one of the guards took pity on him \nand said, 'You fool, this time, when Janak asks who you are, say 'I don't know.' \nKalyan followed this advice. Janak then turned his gaze upon him, and he lost consciousness \nof all bodies, of the whole world, and became conscious of his own self as the infinite God. \nThe meaning of this tale is, unless you lose the I, you cannot see and become God. Because \nwhere you are, God is not. \n17 September 1954, \nMeherabad, \nGM p242-244 \nBack to top \nKILL OR KISS? \nProphet Muhammad once told his chief apostle, Ali, 'If you want to know me, try your \nutmost to control your anger and transform it into love. \nThe very next day someone challenged Ali to a fight. Ali fought him and won. He brought the \nman down and sat on his chest. \nThe man spat right in Ali's face (the worst insult to a Muslim), and Ali got so angry he raised \nhis dagger to kill him. But then Ali remembered what Muhammad had said, and so instead \nhe kissed him, and let him go. \nNow if he had not gotten angry, he would not have had the opportunity to control himself. \nThat does not mean that you should go on kissing each other when you are angry. \n5 September 1940, \nMeherabad, \nLM7 p2607 \nBack to top",

Baba told him, \nThis is not bad news, this is very good news. You are lucky to have so many hardships. The \nfact is that there are no hardships, because everything in the world is one big zero. I see and \nexperience this every moment. \nOnce tested by the Avatar or Sadguru, the devotee will feel as if he is about to die. It is \nterrible. This Path of God is the harshest and most insurmountable thing possible. \nStill, don't worry and don't lose hope. Good times are ahead, and after these difficulties, \nquietude and comfort await you. Terrible suffering is a sign of happiness and peace to come. \nGreat heat denotes the coming of rain. Great suffering and intense sorrow indicate that \nhappiness is about to dawn. \nAnything beyond your capacity will necessarily change your capacity, because so long as \neverything is within your limits, you don't know what is beyond them. And everything \nconcerning God and God-realisation is beyond limit. So in this way great suffering and being \nplagued with terrible problems are beneficial. \nPeople pray to me to solve their difficulties, saying that they love me. But there is a vast \ndifference between love and prayer. In Persian (the expression) to pray means to beg, to \nwant, to desire something, even the blessings of God. But when a person really loves, he \ngives himself over to his beloved completely. This is true love. In that there is no begging, no \nwanting, and no room for desires. Only the longing to unite with the beloved remains. \nLove means the renunciation of the self. Prayer means selfishness, no matter how high the \nprayer may be. So there is a vast difference between when one prays and when one loves. \nJuly 1931, \nKarachi, \nLM4 p1374 \nSuffering is the keynote of the spiritual life. \nSadgurus and the Avatar never avoid suffering, either their own, or their Circle's, by doing \nmiracles. They suffer themselves, and let their Circle suffer too. \n4 August 1937, \non board the ship Strathanavar \nen route from Bombay to Marseilles, LM6 p2199 \nService to the Master is an ordeal which tries the body, mind and spirit.

PL p31 \nGod is equally within us all, and we must love him. When we realise him, all our suffering \ncomes to an end. And for this we must love him in every walk of life. Love (for God) is best \nexpressed when we give happiness to others at the cost of our own happiness. My blessings. \n---- \nRich or poor, great or small, man or woman, everyone is under the spell of some sort of \nsuffering. The relief for every kind of suffering is within ourselves. If we try to live honestly, \nact honestly, think honestly in every walk of life, under all circumstances, and if we try to \nput our wholehearted faith in God, that relief is found. \nWe are already the possessors of infinite power and happiness, but it is our way of life that \nkeeps us from enjoying the eternal treasures of God. \n1 November 1953, \nDehra Dun \ntwo separate messages, \nGG4 p158, 160 \nAnother version of the second message: MD p15 \nBlessed is he who is forsaken by friends, cut off by colleagues, and ridiculed by relations, for \nthe sake of love for God. \nNothing counts in this illusory world, where even your own self forsakes its own precious \nform. \nWhat really counts is your unfailing devotion and faith in God, the love for God. \nMeher Baba, \nAugust 1955, \nSatara \nletter to W. D. Kain, \nML p105 \nIn the divine scales, vice and virtue are necessary experiences man goes through before \nattaining the supreme balance of Self-realisation, which is beyond all opposites, good and \nbad. \nGood is like a clean mirror that reflects the image of God. When true knowledge is gained, \nyou realise that the reflection is the image of your own self, the God that is in all and in \neverything. \nBad is like the dusty particles that accumulate and hide the image of God, until the mirror \npresents only a distorted or blank surface. It cannot affect the object being reflected; it \nmerely distorts your vision. \nLove is the cleanser that wipes the mirror bright, and enables you to behold with increasing \nclarity the indivisible entity that permeates all life. \nThe negative experience of the bad, with its consequent suffering, ultimately disgusts man, \nand leads him to the positive force of good, thus awakening divine love. Hence the saints of \nthe present are the sinners of the past. In the clarity of the understanding and knowledge \nthey have gained, they show true humility. They do not take pride in their achievements, \nnor condemn the 'sinner,' whom they know to belong equally to God, but help him to \nremove the self-created veil of ignorance and perceive his true identity. \nMan cannot escape his glorious destiny of Self-realisation, and no amount of suffering that \nhe passes through on the way to it can ever be too much. After the apex of suffering has \nbeen reached, the time will soon come for mankind to have a deeper spiritual \nunderstanding, bringing it closer together in universal love and brotherhood in the bond of \ndivine knowledge - the only knowledge worth having. \nMeher Baba, \n1956, \nLB p49-50 \nIvy Duce: Why should misery perpetually exist on earth, in spite of God's infinite love and \nmercy? \nBaba: The source of eternal bliss is the self in all. The cause of perpetual misery is the \nselfishness of all. As long as satisfaction is derived through selfish pursuits, misery will \nalways exist. \nOnly because of the infinite love and mercy of God can man learn to realise, through the \nlessons of misery on earth, that inherent in him is the source of infinite bliss, and all \nsuffering is his labor of love to unveil his own infinite self. \n1956, \nMyrtle Beach, \nLB p52-53 \nSuffering Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "SURRENDER \nMeher Baba \nOne in love tastes the glories of life to the full. The blissful heights of joyousness and the \nbuoyant feelings of heavenly delights are the steady steps towards divine oneness. \nLove surrenders to the will of the beloved, gives all to the beloved, sacrifices all for the \nbeloved, lives for the beloved, dies for the beloved. This supreme state of love is the God-\nstate, for what is God but love - infinite, unbounded, eternal love? \nLove annihilates the lower self, and expresses the higher self. So, dear soul, long for your \ndivine beloved till you become one with your beloved. \nJanuary? 1937, \nNasik, \nLA p165 \nAffirmation of the separative ego is the chief veil between man and his own divine self. But \nthe doors of the heart have to be thrown open by the surrenderance of ego-affirmation, if \nGod as the supreme beloved is to make his entry in the heart. \nNo one can realise God except through the grace and help of a God-realised Master, who is \nTruth incarnate. Only a God-realised Master can awaken this true love in the human heart, \nby consuming through the fire of his grace all the dross that prevents its release. \nThose who have got the courage and the wisdom to surrender themselves to a Perfect \nMaster are the recipients of his grace. The grace of the Master does come to those who \ndeserve it. And when it comes, it enkindles in the human heart a love divine, which not only \nenables the aspirant to become one with God, but also to be of infinite help to others who \nare also struggling with their own limitations. There is no power greater than love. \n14 November 1944, \nto the Theosophical Society, \nNagpur, \nMe p73 \n... If I am the highest of the high, my will is law, my wish governs the law, and my love \nsustains the universe. Whatever your apparent calamities and transient sufferings, they are \nbut the outcome of my love for the ultimate good. Therefore, to approach me for deliverance \nfrom your predicaments, to expect me to satisfy your worldly desires, would be asking me \nto do the impossible - to undo what I have already ordained. \nIf you truly and in all faith accept your Baba as the highest of the high, it behooves you to lay \ndown your life at his feet, rather than to crave the fulfillment of your desires. Not your one \nlife, but your millions of lives would be but a small sacrifice to place at the feet of one such \nas Baba, who is the highest of the high; for Baba's unbounded love is the only sure and \nunfailing guide to lead you safely through the innumerable blind alleys of your transient life. \nThey cannot obligate me who, surrendering their all - body, mind, possessions - which \nperforce they must discard one day - surrender with a motive; surrender because they \nunderstand that to gain the everlasting treasure of bliss, they must relinquish ephemeral \npossessions. This desire for greater gain is still clinging behind their surrender, and as such, \nthe surrender cannot be complete. \nKnow you all, that if I am the highest of the high, my role demands that I strip you of all your \npossessions and wants, consume all your desires, and make you desireless, rather than \nsatisfy your desires. Sadhus, saints, yogis and walis can give you what you want; but I take \naway your wants and free you from attachments and liberate you from the bondage of \nignorance. I am the one to take, not the one to give what you want or as you want... \n7 September 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nGM p212 \nI am happy to be in your midst. It is the deep love of some of my lovers in  Dehra Dun that \nhas drawn you all together today to have my darshan. \nBut to have my real darshan is not easy. To see me at close quarters, to do obeisance to me, \nto offer me fruits and flowers, to bow down to me, and then to return to your homes can \nnever mean that you have had my darshan. \nHaving seen me with your own eyes, you have still not seen me as I am. You have not had \neven a glimpse of my true being, in spite of your having gone through the convention of so-\ncalled darshan. \nTo have my real darshan is to find me. The way to find me is to find your abode in me. And \nthe only one and sure way to find your abode in me is to love me. \nTo love me as I love you, you must become the recipient of my grace. Only my grace can \nbestow the gift of divine love. \nTo receive my grace, you must obey me wholeheartedly, with the firm foundation of \nunshakeable faith in me. And you can only obey me spontaneously as I want when you \ncompletely surrender yourselves to me, so that my wish becomes your law and my love \nsustains your being. \nAge after age, many aspire for such a surrender, but only very few really attempt to \nsurrender themselves to me completely as I want. He who succeeds ultimately not only \nfinds me, but becomes me, and realises the aim of life. \nMy being in your midst today would serve its purpose even if one from this multitude has \nunderstood what I want you all to know. I give my blessings to you all. \nNovember 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nMD p2 \nAnother version: \nLA p463-464 \nI want you to make me your constant companion. Think of me more than you think of your \nown self. The more you think of me, the more you will realise my love for you. Your duty is \nto keep me constantly with you throughout your thoughts, speech and actions. \nThey do their duty who, sincere in their faith and love, surrender to me, guided by the \nimplicit belief in my divinity as Baba. They too do their duty who speak ill of me and \ncondemn me through their writings, urged by their genuine conviction that Baba is a fraud. \nBut they are the hypocrites who, not knowing their own minds, are constantly doubting. \nThey are at times, through false emotions, inclined to believe in me, and at other times to \nindulge in slanderous gossip against me. \nNo amount of slander can ever affect or change me, nor any amount of admiration and \npraise enhance or glorify my divinity. Baba is what he is. I was Baba, I am Baba, and shall for \never more remain Baba. My blessings to you all. \nNovember 1953, \nDehra Dun, \nmessage for the opening of \nMeher Centre in Kovvur on 20 November, \nGG4 p181 \nI have often said that I have not yet found one who could love me. There are about 220 men \nand women from East and West who have surrendered to me in such a way as to do \nanything I say. It is a fact. \nFor example, Eruch. He is intelligent, has a good heart. If I order him to do anything, he will \ntry 100%, even to cut himself to pieces. Pendu, Meherjee, Mandali who are with me since \nyears together, they all are the same. Each of these 220 Mandali would lay down their lives. \nWhat I want to point out is, to surrender is higher than to love. And paradoxical as it may \nseem, to love me is impossible, but to obey me is possible, though very difficult. So to call \nyourself my workers and yet not to obey is hypocritical... \nFrom you Andhras, I want nothing. No surrender, no obedience, no mind, no body, no \npossessions. I want only love... \n1-2 March 1954, \nRajamundry, Andhra, \nAD p116, 119 \nAnother version: GG5 p236-259 \nMy message has always been, and always will be, love divine. When one wholeheartedly \nloves God, one eventually loses oneself in the beloved and enters the eternal life of God. \nLike a tree, such love has branches: branches of wholehearted devotion, perfect \nnonviolence, perfect selfless service, self-denial, self-sacrifice, self-renunciation, truth, and \nself-annihilation. In this love is embodied all the yogas known to saints and seekers. \nThe highest aspect of this love, which surpasses that of love itself, is the aspect of complete \nsurrenderance to the will of the beloved; that is, absolute obedience to his wishes, whatever \nthe cost. \n1954? India, MD p4 \nWhen one truly loves God, one longs for union with him, and this supreme longing is based \non the desire of giving up one's whole being to the beloved. \nWhen one loves a Perfect Master, one longs to serve him, to surrender to his will, to obey \nhim wholeheartedly. Thus pure, real love longs to give, and does not ask for anything in \nreturn. \n1954? India, MD p6 \n... For the fulfillment of the divinely ordained plan, it is necessary that humanity should \nthrow away all its accumulated impediments, and surrender unconditionally to the abiding \nlove of God, the unfailing and supremely universal beloved. God has to be accepted in all \nsimplicity, and not by laboriously proved intellectual conclusions. \n1954? India, MD p16-17 \nThere are three types of lovers of God. The first is the mast, who loves and knows only God. \nHe loses all consciousness of self, of body and the world. Whether it rains or shines, whether \nit is winter or summer, it is all the same to him. Only God exists for him. He is dead to \nhimself. \nThe second type of lover is the one who lives in the world, attends to all worldly duties fully, \nyet all the time in his heart he knows that this is temporary, that only God exists, and he \nloves God internally, without anyone knowing it. \nThe third type, which is the highest, is very rare. Here the lover surrenders completely to \nChrist, to the Avatar, to the God-man. He lives, not for himself, but for the Master. This is the \nhighest type of lover. Unless you have such love, merely to criticise and to judge others will \ntake you nowhere. \n14 September 1954, \nMeherabad, \nGM p230 \nLove is a gift from God to man. \nObedience is a gift from Master to man. \nAnd surrender is a gift from man to Master. \nThe one who loves desires to do the will of the beloved, and seeks union with the beloved. \nObedience performs the will of the beloved, and seeks the pleasure of the beloved. \nSurrender resigns to the will of the beloved, and seeks nothing. \nOne who loves is the lover of the beloved. \nOne who obeys is the beloved of the beloved. \nOne who surrenders all - body, mind and all else - has no existence other than that of the \nbeloved, who alone exists in him. \nTherefore greater than love is obedience, and greater than obedience is surrender. And yet, \nas words, all three can be summed up in one phrase: love divine. \nOne can find volumes and volumes of prose and poetry about love, but there are very, very \nfew persons who have found love and experienced it. No amount of reading, listening and \nlearning can ever tell you what love is. Regardless of how much I explain love to you, you \nwill understand it less and less if you think you can grasp it through the intellect or \nimagination. \nHafez describes the bare truth about love when he says, \nJanab-e ishqra dargah basi bala tar-azaq'l ast; \nKasi in astan busad kay jan der astin darad. \n\"The majesty of love lies far beyond the reach of intellect; \nOnly one who has his life up his sleeve dares kiss the threshold of love.\" \nThe difference between love and intellect is something like that between night and day; they \nexist in relation to one another and yet as two different things. Love is real intelligence \ncapable of realising Truth. Intellect is best suited to know all about duality, which is born of \nignorance and is entirely ignorance. When the sun rises, night is transformed into day. Just \nso, when love manifests, not-knowing (ignorance) is turned into conscious knowing \n(knowledge). \nIn spite of the difference between a keenly intelligent person and a very unintelligent \nperson, each is equally capable of experiencing love. The quality which determines one's \ncapacity for love is not one's wit or wisdom, but one's readiness to lay down life itself for \nthe beloved, and yet remain alive. One must, so to speak, slough off body, energy, mind and \nall else, and become dust under the feet of the beloved. This dust of a lover who cannot \nremain alive without God - just as an ordinary man cannot live without breath - is then \ntransformed into the beloved. Thus man becomes God. \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p17-18 \nAnother partial version: EN p5 \nAbout thirty years ago, before I started observing my silence, and when Meherabad was a \ncolony of hundreds of seekers, servers and sufferers who lived in the ashrams, asylums, \nschools, dispensaries and the hospital here at that time, a visitor came to surrender to me. \nHe could not help weeping when I told him that what he intended was very, very difficult, \nsince surrenderance means obedience, and obedience has but one meaning, and that is to \nobey. He said he knew that, and was prepared to obey me implicitly. \nWhen I inquired if he would cut his own child to pieces if I asked him to do so, he even \nagreed to that. But when I asked him to remove his clothes and walk about naked in the \nstreets of Ahmednagar, he began to protest, and ultimately went his way. \nI am not going to ask you to do that. I never expect anyone to do the impossible. \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p22 \nHe who genuinely surrenders to a Perfect Master surrenders completely without asking for \npermission to do so. \nHe does not even expect acceptance of his surrender from the Master. \nComplete surrender in itself embodies the acceptance of one who has surrendered \ncompletely as he ought to have done. \n1958, GM p330 \nDo you realise what it means to follow me? It means to leave all and follow me. And do you \nknow what it is to leave all? It is to leave everything, even your self, behind you. \nThis means that, having left everything behind, you have to follow me, and not run ahead of \nme. And to do this is so very difficult because it is so very simple. \nIf you let your will guide you, so that you walk ahead of me, you become your own \nobstruction to my leading you. And since you are ignorant of the pitfalls on the way, I have \nto keep a constant watch lest you fall. What this amounts to is that, instead of you following \nme, I have to follow you. \nI am not limited by form. I am within everyone, and within you, as the real guide. So \nfollowing me does not mean that you have to leave everything and stay near me. It also does \nnot mean that you are to use me as a dumping board for your worries, nor that you are to \nexpect me to fulfill your wants. It means that you are to be completely resigned to my will, \nand abide in a spirit of total surrender. \nTo follow me is to obey me and to do as I want. When my will becomes your way, you are \ntruly following me, and then you are safe and you are saved. I know the way and its \nlabyrinths, for I am the way and I am the goal. \nJanuary 1959, \nPoona, to an individual, \nAO p167 \nWhen lust goes, love appears. And out of love comes longing. In love there can never be \nsatisfaction, for longing increases till it becomes an agony which ceases only in union. \nNothing but union with the beloved can satisfy the lover. \nThe way of love is a continual sacrifice. And what gets sacrificed are the lovers thoughts of \n'I,' until at last comes the time when the lover says, 'O beloved, will I ever become one with \nyou and so lose myself forever? But let this be only if it is your will.' This is the stage of love \nenlightened by obedience. \nNow the lover continuously witnesses the glory of the beloved's will. And in the witnessing \ndoes not even think of union. He willingly surrenders his entire being to the beloved, and \nhas no thought of self left. This is the stage when love is illumined by surrender. \nOut of millions, only one loves God. And out of millions of lovers, only one succeeds in \nobeying, and finally in surrendering his whole being to God the beloved. \nI am God personified. You who have the chance of being in my living presence are fortunate \nand blessed. \nc.1960? EN p4 \nI belong to no religion. My religion is love. Every heart is my temple. Although it is in love \nthat you have built this house of stone, I am only in it when your heart brings me here. \nAlways remember that ceremonies cover me, but pure worship reveals me... \nAll those who surrender themselves in love to me will see and adore and realise the reality \nbehind my form. \nNovember 1961, \nmessages given for Meher Dham \nNauranga, Hamirpur, \nLC p109-110, also Mu p372 \nDesires and longings are the root-cause of all suffering. \nThe only real desire is to see God, and the only real longing is to become one with God. This \nreal desire and longing frees one from the bondage of birth and death. Other desires and \nlongings bind one with ignorance. \nTo desire the real desire and to long for the real longing, you need my grace. And you cannot \nhave that until you surrender all other desires and longings to me. \nYour love for me will help you to surrender these desires and longings, and my love for you \nwill help you to desire the real desire and long for the real longing, which are by my grace. \nDecember 1966, \nIndia, \nLA p645 \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "THEOSOPHY \nMeher Baba \nThe Theosophists, including Besant Bai and Master Murti, do not have even a smell of the \nTruth. It is said that the spirit of the World Teacher will manifest itself to the world through \nthe medium of this boy, and the wire-puller of this show is supposed to be somewhere in \nthe Himalayas. \nThere is nothing but ice and stones and dust in the mountains and on the plains. The real \nteachers like the Buddha, Krishna, Jesus and Zoroaster, never kept themselves perched on \nsome mountain peak or hid themselves in the jungle. They freely mingled with those they \nhad come to save. In spite of their unimaginable exultation, they came down to the lowest \nlevels of men. \nNot a single spiritual Master ever required any vehicle save his own physical body. In truth, \nthis false note of the Theosophists in the eternal God-man's song of God and man is the \nresult of the multifarious aspects of my work, and my methods in clearing a path for my \nmanifestation. \nDecember? 1925, \nMeherabad, \nSW p262-263 \nBesant Bai = Annie Besant \nMaster Murty = Jiddu Krishnamurti \nKrishnamurti a new world teacher? God forbid. You cannot compare the Sadguru \nRamakrishna of  Calcutta with Krishnamurti. Ramakrishna was Rama and Krishna \npersonified. Krishnamurti is living in all majesty and splendor, pomp and power, and \nmoving about  England in aristocratic, fashionable circles, playing tennis and golf, leading a \nmost comfortable life. He does not have the slightest idea, not even a wisp, of the real Truth. \nSo it is also with these funny, showy Theosophists. Their greatness lies only in editorship, \nwriting and speaking with high-sounding words about planes, powers, colors, secret \ndoctrine, society and caste. Truth is far, far beyond this. \nIf you desire to aspire for Realisation, you should hold your very life in the palm of your \nhand, ready to give it up at any moment. Then alone will you be deemed worthy, and be able \nto experience Truth. \n26 June 1926, \nMeherabad, \nto visitors who asked him about the Theosophists, \nLM3 p816-817 \nAbout Krishnamurti: \nHe is not as advanced as some think. He does good, and will come to me one day. I will help \nhim advance on the Path. \nNovember 1931, \nHarmon-on-Hudson, New York \nto Max Wardhall, \nLM4 p1469 \nCharles Norwood: What is your opinion of the Theosophists Annie Besant and Charles \nLeadbeater? \nBaba: They have done some good work, but there is still much to be done. They are \nsomewhat advanced souls. But at a certain stage of advancement, without the guidance and \nhelp of a Master, hostile forces are created, resulting in delusion. It all becomes a jumble, \nand there is confusion. \n24 November 1931, \nNew York, \nLM4 p1488 \nMeher Baba was asked about one of Krishnamurti's teachings: \nQ. It has been said that by breaking through the different hindrances of lust, hate, etc., one \ncan develop true love. But your teaching is that by developing true love, one can break \nthrough these hindrances. \nBaba: The method of love is direct. The other method is indirect and round about. It is like \nreaching the mouth (for eating) with your hand from behind the neck. \nQ. It has been said that a person can, by increasing his own intensity of awareness and \neffort, break through his bonds and attain freedom. If one can thus free himself, why is a \nMaster necessary? \nBaba: How can you free yourself, when your hands and feet are bound? I can set you free \nbecause I am free. If you think that by relying upon yourself you can attain the truth, you \ndepend upon a teaching. But then why not rely upon the ocean of truth, the living \nembodiment of truth, rather than a dead formula or principle? \n1930s? A p49-50 \nQ. Have you met Annie Besant? \nBaba: No, but I know her. She was an advanced soul. \nQ. I know her since I was a child. They all started it (Theosophy) with good ideas, but too \nmuch schism and personality spoiled it. And there are so many divisions now. \nBaba: That's the trouble. In spirituality, it is the heart that counts, and not the head. Too \nmuch of intellectual discourses undermine the object with which these (movements and \ninstitutions) are started... \n1934, \nZurich, Switzerland? \nA p41 \nGarrett Fort: Is there really the place known as Shambala, the Astral centre where the \nMasters dwell in disembodied form? \nBaba: It is presumed that you already know that planes are not places. The state and stage \nconnoting Shambala exists. There is difference of terminology only. This is also known as \nVidnyan. \nGarrett Fort: Are there seven rays as told about in the occult books, and are there Masters \nwho function on these respective rays, such as Jesus, who stands on what is called the sixth \nray of devotion, or abstract realism; the Master Djwal Khul on the second ray of \nlove/wisdom; the Master Hilarion on the fifth ray of concrete knowledge or science, the \nincarnation of Paul of Tarsus, this time in a Cretan body and spending much time in Egypt? \nBaba: The seven rays with their peculiar characteristics are a symbolic expression of the \nseven stages of the return journey of a Realised soul to normal consciousness. Those \nRealised beings who have a duty to perform and a mission to fulfill, have to come down to \nnormal consciousness and take their stand at one of the seven stages of the return journey \nbest suited for the fulfillment of their task. These seven stages of the return journey have \ntheir peculiar features and characteristics, and reflect the outward circumstances of a \nMaster. For instance, one Master lives on earth like a prince, another lives in all austerity. \nOne is in the midst of the busy world, another in seclusion. The powers are peculiar to \ndifferent stages. For instance, healing of diseases and bringing of the dead to life is \ncharacteristic of the fourth stage. \nGarrett Fort: Where is the Hall of Learning of which I have read, where those on the Path are \ntaken as they progress to take the first few initiations? Books allegedly dictated by Hilarion \ndescribe it impressively, telling of the great host of souls who stand within it, veiled, \nthinking themselves alone until their veils are raised with various initiations. Here take \nplace the ceremonies of the soul that begin in December and last until Easter. Is all this true, \nor just told as symbolism? \nBaba: Hall of Learning is pure symbolism. It is analogous to Islamic belief and picture of \nDarbare Muhammadi, i.e. the court of Muhammad. The inner court presided over by \nMuhammad in person, and the outer court presided over by deputies, and the outermost \ncourt consisting of those prepared souls clamoring for entry, is similar to the picture drawn \nby Hilarion, as you say. \nGarrett Fort: Will I have to wait until I have received Realisation to carry on work on the \nAstral plane, as I asked when I first met you? Do I work now without being able to bring \nanything through? How long will it be before I am able to direct my consciousness \ndeliberately to leave my body and establish contact with those whom I love, or would like to \nhelp, regardless of time and place? \nBaba: Yes, you are working on the Astral plane, but unconsciously. In order to do so \nconsciously, you are to attain Illumination (6th plane) which is a prelude to Realisation. I \nhave assured you of the experience one day. \nGarrett Fort: Is it impertinent to ask why you are focusing our attention on such a high goal, \nrather than showing us the lower planes and giving us understanding of their properties \nand functions? The high ideal is so removed from our understanding that it leaves us empty, \nunsatisfied, still as blind as ever, like a class of children listening to the nebular theory. \nWithout this more elementary knowledge, how can we go back into the world and answer \nthe questions of those who only need and can understand just a little to help solve those \nproblems? We would seem to be then like hundreds of spiritual teachers whose words go \nover the heads of the humble seekers. Most of them are too tired or too blind to deal with \nhigher concepts. They need the simple remedies first. \nBaba: There is no higher or lower goal. There is only one goal, Self-realisation. The journey \nof the planes, from one to the other, is like changing one prison cell for another, or amounts \nto exchanging iron fetters for golden ones. In neither case is one free, and it is perfect \nfreedom from the bindings of the physical and the spiritual planes that I aim at. The \nadvancement on the planes may connote progress and beautitude, tempting to the \nwayfarer. But the allurements of a plane once entered are difficult to shake off. In fact, the \nbindings (sanskaras) of the physical plane are much easier to destroy than the bindings of \nthe Astral planes. I wish you to be free once and for ever. The lower planes are the result of \nimagination, and are based on illusion. However, I shall someday explain the lower planes in \na manner practical and understandable even to a layman. \n1936, \nIndia, \nA p26-28, \nalso T p195-197 \nIn December 1937 Meher Baba visited a branch of the Theosophical Society in Nagpur. He \ntold those gathered, \n\"I give my blessings to you, so that you may long more and more to finally realise the Truth \nthrough experience.\" \nLM6 p2256 \nBaba visited the Theosophical Society in  Nagpur again in November 1944. He had dictated \nthis message, which was read out to them: \nTrue love is very different from an evanescent outburst of indulgent emotionalism or the \nenervating stupor of a slumbering heart. It can never come to those whose hearts are \ndarkened by selfish cravings, or weakened by constant reliance on the lures and \nstimulations of the passing objects of sense. But to those whose hearts are pure and simple, \ntrue love comes as a gift through the activising grace of a Master. \nSuch love is energising and life-giving. It breaks asunder the narrowness and the prejudices \nwhich separate man from man. It inspires man for selfless and creative action which \ncontributes to the well-being of all, without distinction of caste, color, race, nationality, \ncreed or sex. It lifts him from the slavishness of sanskaric attachments to the unhampered \nfreedom of the divinely conscious soul. And it initiates him into the dynamic harmony of life \nin eternity. \nAffirmation of the separative ego is the chief veil between man and his own divine self. But \nthe doors of the heart have to be thrown open by the surrenderance of ego-affirmation, if \nGod as the supreme beloved is to make his entry in the heart. \nNo one can realise God except through the grace and help of a God-realised Master, who is \nTruth incarnate. Only a God-realised Master can awaken this true love in the human heart, \nby consuming through the fire of his grace all the dross that prevents its release. Those who \nhave got the courage and the wisdom to surrender themselves to a Perfect Master are the \nrecipients of his grace. \nThe grace of the Master does come to those who deserve it. And when it comes, it enkindles \nin the human heart a love divine, which not only enables the aspirant to become one with \nGod, but also to be of infinite help to others who are also struggling with their own \nlimitations. There is no power greater than love. \nto the Theosophical Society, \nNagpur \n14 November 1944, \nMe p73 \nTheosophy Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "UNDERSTANDING \nMeher Baba \nNow what is the voice? Where does it originate? When one hears sound coming out of his \nmouth, it must be existing somewhere. \nIn truth, sound pervades the universe. God is sound, light, everything. There is a point from \nwhich sound issues forth, and from that Creation or Om point evolution starts. \nSound has been given a door, our mouth, to manifest from. When a sound comes out of the \nmouth, it is lost in the Universal Sound, which is everywhere... \nIt is for this reason, because sound travels and creates various vibrations, that a person \nshould read the holy books whether he understands their meaning or not. The words in the \nZoroastrians' Zend Avesta, or in the Hindus' Gita, or in the Muslims' Koran, and in other \nscriptures, are so arranged that when they are pronounced, the sound created comes very \nnearly in unison with the Universal Voice or the Universal Sound, and is a great help in \ninfluencing a person spiritually. \n17 October 1922, \nMeherabad, \nLM2 p449 \nBecause I said a thing once, does that mean a law has been laid down for all time? You are \nprofoundly mistaken if you think so. \n9 August 1924, \nMadras, \nto Padri, \nLM2 p668 \nThe realisation of the Supreme Being (Paramatma) as our own self is the realisation of \nTruth. The universe is the outcome of imagination. Then why try to get a superficial \nknowledge of the imaginative universe, rather than acquire the knowledge of self (Truth)? \nWhat is knowledge? Knowledge means the experience of Paramatma (Dnyan) - the \nknowledge of the highest that our soul, which is everlasting, gets of the Supreme Being, i.e., \nSelf-realisation. \nWhat is the universal understanding? It is called Vishva Dnyan, or the knowledge of the \nuniverse with which one comes down after realisation of Paramatma (Dnyan), i.e. \nknowledge of God and the Nirvikalpa state. That is to say, knowledge equals experience plus \nuniversal understanding, or perfect knowledge of that experience. Meaning again that he \nwho acquires knowledge must necessarily acquire experience, and then again, he must have \na perfect knowledge of that experience. Otherwise, those who acquire experience and \nremain in that Nirvikalpa state (the state of Ananta Ananda or everlasting bliss) are called \nMajzoobs. Although they are all-knowing and perfect in every way, they are unable to do \nanything for, or give salvation to, the world. \nIn short, the experience of the state of the Supreme Being (God) is the real state. \nNow let us see what this experience is that one gets before acquiring the real knowledge. \nThe Sadgurus or Realised ones take those to whom they are to give this experience through \nthe seven planes absolutely in the dark - either with bandages around their eyes, or with \ntheir eyes closed. That is, those to whom the Sadguru gives the experience have no \nknowledge of these seven planes. They are quite ignorant of that knowledge, though they \nhave already crossed all these seven planes. \nIt is for this reason that when the candidate for this experience is let off by the Sadguru just \nbelow the seventh plane, his state is unimaginable and indescribable. It is as if an \nunexpected current of millions of candlepower of electric light enters or dissolves his Subtle \nbody. He is amazed and stupefied at this new experience. \nThen, before he can properly think of his new, unimaginably wonderful experience, he \nsuddenly acquires the Nirvikalpa state, where he himself becomes one with the Ananta \nAnanda or eternal bliss. \nBut it is useless to realise all this without personal experience. One may listen to years of \nexplanations, or read volume after volume, but one would not get even a glimpse of an idea - \na shadow of a shadow - of the real experience, without experiencing it personally. \nSuch a perfect state is attained by one out of millions, and that too, only by the grace of a \nSadguru. To talk about this knowledge and experience without acquiring it - to realise it \nonly through philosophy or the superficial knowledge of religion - is utter folly - humbug, \npure and simple. \n29 April 1926, \nMeherabad, \nAw 16:1 p3-4 \nMy explanations are quite, quite different from the scriptures of any religion, and they have \nnothing to do with the shariat aspect of religion. \nIf we find any illumination in scriptures, it is in the Hindu shastras and Vedant. But they too \nare only a shadow of my explanations. None of the great Masters of the past has given such \nexplanations as I have. They were great Masters, great Prophets, and they Realised so many \nsouls. However, what they gave or left to the world was only shariat - sweet syrup. \nThey only gave internal knowedge (gnosis) to their close disciples, who were very, very few. \nWhat they said, and what was written down to make books, was only the knowledge and \nrules of rituals and ceremonies, appealing to the ordinary minds of the time; while what I \ngive is the explanation of the knowledge that is beyond the scope of ordinary intellect to \ngrasp and understand. Even though these explanations are mere shadows of the real \nknowledge, they are beyond mind to follow. What I explain is a subject beyond the \ncomprehension of the mind, and that only to those who are prepared to digest it, not to \neverybody. For all can neither grasp it nor tolerate it, nor even bear to hear it. \nFor example, I say you all are God. Whereas Islam and all other religions claim you are \nservants of God. I say Muhammad was God incarnate, but the Muhammadans say he was \nonly sent as a messenger. The same is the case with Zarathustra and Christ. \nI want you to know that all your clapping, bhajan singing, tying of the Parsi kusti, and \npraying namaz are merely drills. Only take one name of God. Give up anger, lust and greed. \nThis is all that is necessary. \nBut the orthodox section of any religion would blow out my brains if they heard me uttering \nsuch words. And I pity them all. Why? Because they are so narrow-minded, so shallow in \ntheir vision. I say to you, do not be cowards like them, fearing hell and the anger of God for \naccepting these truths, which are real truth. \nThe very foundation of all my explanations is sanskaras, which no religion has explained. I \nhave so clearly and logically put it. Nowhere are sanskaras explained so elaborately or so \neloquently. \n19 August 1926, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p834-835 \nWhat did Jesus really say? \nTo the multitudes he said, 'God is in heaven, try to go there.' And to reach that end, he said \nto overcome certain temptations and sufferings. \nTo the followers, he said, 'God is everywhere. Try to see him.' And he gave explanations to \nthat effect. \nTo the close circle of apostles, he said, 'God is in me, and in you too,' and actually revealed \nthis to them. \nWhy did Jesus say different things? Owing to the time and the people, according to their \nreadiness to listen and understand. \nWhat Jesus meant was to leave all and follow him. That means to know him, see him, \nexperience him. \nThe teachings that are being followed by Christians are not the real teachings Christ gave. \nThe priests have altered his words, added to his teachings and spoiled them. \n5 March 1928, \nMeherabad, \nLM3 p1034-1035 \nA man from the Punjab met Meher Baba, and asked him if he believed in the Bhagavad Gita. \nBaba: I not only believe in it, I experience it every moment. Mere intellectual understanding \nis not sufficient. You may read holy books for the rest of your life, but that will not take you \nan inch nearer to God if you have no desire to see him, to experience him, or to know him. \nJune 1930, \nDomel, \nLM4 p1320 \nThere is bliss everywhere, and nothing else exists. But people do not know it. \nIt is no use listening to lectures, and learning does not come from books. \nDirect experience of God is needed. The experience is spontaneous. It is not to be forcibly \nobtained. \n8 September 1931, \non board the  S. S. Rajputana, \nen route from port Said to \nMarseilles, to Mahatma Gandhi, \nLM4 p1391 \nAfter explaining at length about creation, reincarnation and God-realisation, Baba said, \nLet these matters not be a headache to you. All this is only an explanation. Don't rack your \nbrains over it. Love is supreme, and only love counts. \nHowever much you read, hear or understand about spirituality, it does not lead you to \nknowledge. Knowledge is a totally different thing, and it can only be gained through love - \nlove, pure and steadfast. \nSeptember 1931, \nCombe Martin, \nEngland, \nLM4 p1423 \nThe study of book knowledge and philosophy merely satisfies the intellect, but it is not all. \nThe real thing is to think of God, to feel God and to experience God. \nActual feeling, perception and experience should be gained, for these are real. \nIntellectual conviction is the first step, and faith is born from it, but there should be \ncontinuous progress. \nSeptember 1931, \nLondon, \nto Mr. Audrey, \nLM4 p1433-1434 \nThere is a vast difference between the intellect and the heart. It would be wonderful if both \nwere used for the highest good, but to have only intellect with a dry heart is of no use. The \nsupremacy of the heart over the intellect is best. \nCompared to a religious hypocrite, an honest atheist is preferred. Books give only the outer \nhusk. Real knowledge is not derived from books. Real knowledge is the Guru's gift, but it is \nnot given without paying the price of love - loving. \nLove has great powers, and love is the shortest and easiest path to Self-realisation. Only \nthrough love can Realisation be attained. \nSeptember 1931, \nLondon, \nto Henry Strutton, \nLM4 p1434 \n... There is bound to occur misunderstanding through misrepresentation of facts recollected \nand written down by a third person - especially if reproduced by another not directly \ninvolved in the conversation that has taken place. \n1932, Nasik, \nto Chanji, \nLM5 p1735 \nQ. I have come to ask to develop the divine within. I feel I cannot achieve it alone, without \nhelp. \nBaba: You will... by my help. Never be disheartened. It is all within, and I will help you to \nopen it. I am so happy to see you longing for spiritual attainment. \nQ. I do not know anything but this, and I ask for nothing else. \nBaba: I am so happy to know this. \nQ. How can spirituality be attained? \nBaba: It can be attained, not by the intellect, but by heart and feeling and inner experience. I \nwould explain for hours, but that would be nothing compared to one second of my internal \nhelp. \nDo one thing: every night, just before retiring, think for one minute, \nThe infinite God is within me, \nand I am part of the infinite. \nThis will contact you more and more with me internally. \n1930s, Europe, A p6 \nAnother version: PM p243 \nAn architect came to see Meher Baba. \nBaba: Anything to ask? \nQ. I cannot ask anything. I am so perplexed. \nBaba: And it is a pity I have not much time, because when one comes, I must explain. But for \nthat I must have time. Anyway, you can ask. I would like to make you sit here and think of \nquestions. \nQ. But it makes it so awkward for you. \nBaba: Never mind, go on. \nQ. I am very anxious to find something real that we have to think of and do. \nBaba: And that something is the only thing worth having. I will help you spiritually. \nQ. Can I have that? \nBaba: Yes, I know. You can. It is not through words or explanations that it can be explained. \nIt is within you. It is to be opened. I will do it. \nQ. In New York I saw some of your people, who made me think and feel I must have \nsomething else to seek, and for that, I do try to see that reality. \nBaba: And when you find it, you can experience (higher) things even while being in your \nworldly affairs. \nEvery morning, just the moment you get up, think for a minute, \nIt is in me \nAnd rest assured that I will help you. I can help you. \nQ. I understand very well. I realise and believe it. I thank you very much for all that you have \ngiven me already, and am sure I will be helped. \n1930s, Europe? A p7 \nAnother version: PM p247 \nThe secrets of life are absolutely unintelligible to the human mind. That is why they are \nnever revealed as they are, but in different methods and shapes. \n1 January 1935, \nLos Angeles, California, \nto Karl Vollmoeller, \nLM6 p1942-1943 \nMy work is worldwide, hence I have to come into contact with all kinds of people, all \nreligions, and all countries, in the East as well as in the West. And while working with them, \nI have to be very careful to consider the feelings and impression created on all who come in \nmy contact, especially of those whom I want to work for me, immediately at the moment, or \nlater on in the future. If I don't do that, none would come in, or would be induced or \npersuaded to do the work as I want him or her to do. \nAnd in the great scheme of a worldwide campaign, I require men and women of all castes, \ncreeds, cults and denominations in life, from the poorest peasant to the richest Rockefeller, \neach to fit in for a particular type of work in his or her class or community, according as I \nfind the person willing and inclined. Thus there would be Hindus and Muhammadans, Parsis \nand Christians, Easterners and Westerners, each with certain tendencies, temperaments, \ninclinations and fitness or fondness to do a certain type of work. Each has, at the time, \ncertain weaknesses or prejudices, side by side with good qualities, and it is all these things \nand factors I have to observe and consider if I want a particular person to fit in anywhere \nfor certain work of mine. \nSo whenever a person is introduced or comes in, I overlook - and for a certain period in the \nbeginning, even pamper - his prejudices of caste, creed or religion, and tolerate his other \nweaknesses in nature and temperament, till he is gradually trained and prepared to give \nthese up one by one, and begins to understand things in a better light and broader angle of \nvision, to which he is all the while trained through lectures, explanation and talks, and \nreferences with others which are really meant for him. It is a very delicate and difficult task, \ninvolving so many problems for a number of persons concerned in a particular question. \nSome have to tolerate and suffer unnecessarily for others, who are thus being trained. \nThus if a Hindu comes to see me, I have to look to his caste -- Brahmin, untouchable, etc. -- \nand talk and deal with him accordingly. Similarly in the case of a Parsi, a Muhammadan or a \nChristian, I explain things as the person likes the best, pleasing his or her temperament, \ninclinations, prejudices, etc., so that he will digest what I want to impress on him, and then \ntry to learn to come over and rise above his prejudices gradually. \nThus so many have been trained during all these years, so that the Hindus, Muhammadans, \nParsis, Christians - all of the Mandali - have learned to live as one family. Their religious and \nother prejudices have been practically destroyed, and they are convinced now that all their \nweaknesses and prejudices were false and unreal -- that real religion is one, of universal \nbrotherhood and love for all alike, etc. This they are taught after years of training and \ncareful tactics observed by me in handling each case separately, according to the \nrequirements of each, which I know, and tactfully bringing them all through the path of \nprejudices... \nBut if I were to teach these spiritual truths from the very beginning, disregarding their \nhuman weaknesses and religion or caste prejudices during the preliminary stage of training, \nnone of you would have come in, much less been trained to the discipline and \nunderstanding of life as you are now. \nAnd there are so many different kinds and types of persons, with hundreds of varieties of \nweakness and prejudice, which I have to deal with and tackle tactfully and delicately during \nthe first stages, overlooking tolerantly their many faults, even persuading them in spite of \ntheir own stupidities and deliberate wrong actions, suffering myself intensely, and at times \nmaking others suffer unnecessarily, too, for which they again blame me, get annoyed and \nupset, etc., so that I have the additional task of explaining to them again why I do certain \nthings at certain times. \nThus there are complications always in such a universal work as mine, where so many \nquestions and factors concerning hundreds or thousands at a time are involved, and there \nare always chances of my actions, words or explanations being misinterpreted or \nmisunderstood, in one place or the other. In trying to please everybody, one pleases nobody. \nYet I have to try to please everybody in turns, or on certain occasions simultaneously, \nthrough different moves, actions and words as required for certain persons and at certain \nplaces. \n16 April 1936, \nMysore, \nHM p476-477 \nAnother version: LM6 p1995-1997 \nIf a lecturer speaks today before a gathering of five hundred, and the same subject is \nrepeated by the five hundred listeners to others, there would be five hundred different \ninterpretations -- some never dreamed of by the speaker. Therefore, what about the \nteachings of Masters like Jesus, interpreted after him perhaps a thousand times through \ndifferent interpreters in the past? The original thought is sometimes lost sight of, or made \nirrelevant, but yet each clings to his own different interpretation of the original. \nThat is why many today hesitate to believe in the Bible and other such books, where \ninterpretations do not appeal to them. There is more of the writers in the Bible than of Jesus \nChrist. Thus it is that there are always quarrels between fanatic followers of different \nreligions over words and explanations that the Prophets never uttered, but were written in \nthe so-called holy scriptures by over-enthusiastic disciples and priests, which quite \nnaturally creates a revolt in the minds of others. \n12 November 1937, \nto a Christian minister \non board the S.S. Circassia, \nLM6 p2235 \nTruth is infinitely simple, and to realise it is naturally also easy. Complications are not \nnatural to unity, because duality is based on complications. \nBooks, philosophies and different terms all lead to confusion and contradiction if not \napplicable to one's spiritual tendency. \nGod-realisation means living in and with God in every thought and action -- to be so \nspontaneous as to naturally express divinity through every thought and deed consciously. It \nis divinely and consciously automatic. \n18 November 1937, \nto a small group of  passengers on the S.S. \nCircassia, LM6 p2236 \nThe naad or celestial music (sound) is peculiar to the first plane, and can be experienced or \ninduced by the mantric force. It is on account of this that even an unintelligent repetition or \nreading of scriptures is encouraged and advocated. \n1938? QM p68 \nAlso MJ 1:3 p83-84 \nand Tr p185-187 \nIt is not through intellectual exercises and such learning, or knowledge acquired by reading \nor hearing lectures, that spiritual Truth can be understood. At the most, these can give one \nan intellectual understanding, which is the first preparatory stage for ushering one into the \nPath. \nWhat is essential is a true inner feeling, an actual experience of the Truth, which is real, \nlasting and convincing. When one experiences union with God, one knows by actual \nexperience that one is in harmony with everything and everyone, that there is nothing but \none infinite indivisible existence, and all else is but fleeting shadows. \n23 July 1939, \nMeherabad \nto D. B. K. \nKalelkar, \nLM7 p2432 \nQ. Is it possible to understand spiritual matters intellectually? \nBaba: Spiritual doctrines can be stated in intellectual terms. Intellect is a great help in the \nexperience of the heart. \nIf someone who never had a headache asks you to explain it to him, you will try to explain \nintellectually what it is. But to make him understand it, you would have to hit him over the \nhead. He gets a headache and knows what it is. \nThere is nothing irrational in spirituality. Explanation can be made so practical that it can be \nlived. \nInterview with a newspaper reporter, \n11 February 1940 \nBangalore, \nLM7 p2515-2516 \nThere are three languages in which the Avatar teaches: \nIn ordinary language, for the masses who follow the shariat and ritual of their religion, so \nthat they can understand. \nIn language both ordinary and mystical, for the few advanced souls. \nIn language wholly mystical for the Circle. \n17 May 1943, \nMeherabad, \nLM8 p2887 \n(For more about the Avatar's Circle of disciples, see 'The Mandali' in Books One and Two. \nAlso see Discourses (7th edition) p288-297.) \nRealisation of the self should not be confused with the intellectual understanding of the \nDivine Theme. Exceptional exercise of the intellect makes one a philosopher, a poet, a \nscientist or an artist. But Self-realisation is undeniably the special privilege of those who are \nmad after God. \nOrthodoxy, whether it be of the Hindu, Muslim Christian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, or any \nother church, is tolerable strictly and only up to a certain point, and only at the earlier \nphases of the evolution of the masses, since it conserves certain dynamic values coming \ndown through tradition. But it must be of the discriminative type, and should not be allowed \nto degenerate into politics. When orthodoxy denies to itself the spiritual light coming from \nany quarter, it inevitably reduces itself to a body without the soul, leading to separative \nignorance, conflicts and misunderstandings. \nLoyalty to the incarnated greatness of the past, and the mere possession and knowledge of \nthe traditional lore, is not all that is to be aspired for. It may preserve your individuality as a \nreligious and cultural unit, and make of you a political factor to be reckoned with. But in the \nspiritual domain, it makes you a nonentity, a tree without its life-giving sap. \nToday there are three concomitant factors which prevent the world from realisation of true \nspirituality: \n1. The church of each organised religion trades in the past, and fights every inch of ground \nbefore adjusting itself to the times and the circumstances. \n2. The educated delude themselves into thinking that they have done their part, and have \nlaid the whole creation and the Creator under deep gratitude by merely talking on the \nsubject from the purely intellectual point of view. \n3. And the masses have a superstitiously mercenary attitude towards saints and spirituality. \nTheir approach to saints is invariably from a material point of view. \nI have come to give a new understanding of spiritual value and truth to everyone. This truth \nis unlimited, and cannot be encaged in any dogmas or creeds or religions or sets of beliefs. \nInherit this vast truth which is ever-renewing, while I am in your midst. \nbefore 1948, ST p110-111 \nTruth is to be experienced. \nIntellectual knowledge does not lead to Truth. \nJanuary 1948, \nMeherazad, \nto Ivy Duce, \nOL \n... He who would deeply ponder over the truth which I declare shall eventually be initiated \ninto the life eternal. \nIndia, \nNovember 1952, \nAw 5:4 p35 \nIt shall be the duty of every member: \na) To become conversant with the principles of Sufism by reading and studying the \nliterature of Sufi saints, poets and authors such as Hafiz, Jalaluddin, Shams, Inayat Khan, Ibn \nArabi, Shibli, Hujwiri, and others. \nb) To necessarily read and study vigorously the Discourses by Meher Baba and the book by \nMeher Baba called 'God Speaks' which depicts the ten states of God and other important \ntruths, and which is his last and final book on this subject. \nNovember 1952, India \n'Chartered Guidance from Meher Baba \nfor Sufism Reoriented as the Highway \nto the Ultimate Universalised' \nSection Five: Duties and Obligations \nThe question of details is all the more important when a subject is beyond ordinary human \nexperience. On the one hand, more details confuse one more, and less details explain things \nless. This gives rise to a variety of terms and expressions for use from differing viewpoints \nand in different contexts. \nIn the absence of underlying experience, descriptions of the same one thing often sound \ncontradictory. But in the light of relative experiences, or the final realisation of Truth, the \nvery contradictions prove to be complementary expressions about the same one Truth. \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1955, GS p243 \nEach is free to think of me and interpret my work as he feels or understands best. Either my \nwords must be presented as they stand, or if interpreted by you, you must not fail to state it \nis your own interpretation. \nIf I am what I am, it is all the more natural for you not to be able to understand all that I \nwish to express, and why I say all that I say. \nWhatever I have said and have been saying, I was made to say by God. When I say a thing, \nGod makes me say so. \n24 April 1955, \nSatara, \nGG6 p241-243 \n(three separate quotes) \nThe seers of all times have had direct access to the truth about life and death, and they have \nrepeatedly given a suffering and groping humanity useful information on this point. \nTheir explanations are important because they protect man's mind from erroneous and \nharmful attitudes towards life and death, and prepare him for perception of the truth. \nAlthough direct knowledge of truth requires considerable spiritual perception, \nnevertheless, even correct intellectual understanding of the relationships of life and death \nplays an important part in restoring mankind to a healthy outlook. \nbefore 1956, \nLH p96-97 \nIn February, 1958, Francis Brabazon wrote to Meher Baba, saying that he was reading the \nscriptures of various religions to help him write 'Stay With God: A Statement in Illusion on \nReality.' Baba wrote back: \n\"The scriptures are like rotten bones rotted, and are as food for worms. \n\"Theosophy and philosophy are like good bones rotted, and are as food for vultures. \n\"The writings of inspired poets are like fresh bones, and are as food for dogs. \n\"The writings of spiritually advanced saints are like flesh, and are as food for tigers. \n\"The writings by living Perfect Masters are like brain, and are as food for men. \n\"Good bones, when rotted, have some semblance of bone, but rotten bones when rotted are \nlike filth. \n\"So you may go through the scriptures superficially -- only to drive away the barking dogs \nwhen necessary; for instance, when you are called upon to answer the queries of the priests \nand the orthodox.\" \nLM 11-12 preface \nWhen 'Stay With God' was published in 1959, Baba commented, 'My love will touch the \nheart of all who read it, as no book has ever done.' \nIn spite of so many books, such as 'God Speaks,' 'Listen Humanity,' 'Life at its Best,' etc., \nwords remain words. Words and learning will never carry one too far. Those who have love \nfor me need not read anything. Reading is not necessary for those who love... love takes one \nbeyond the intellect and beyond the mind. I have been saying authoritatively to the world \nthat I am the ancient one. Love me. If you love me with all your heart, then you shall be free. \n26 February 1958, \nMeherabad \nAw 7:3 p31-32 \nBooks and discourses will not bring about one's spiritual regeneration. Mind cannot be \nannihilated by mind, for one cannot jump over oneself. Only by loving me as I ought to be \nloved can the mind be destroyed. Anyone may have love for me, but not the love I want... \nIn spite of all explanations and reading of books, words remain mere words. They do not \ntake one any further than intellectual satisfaction. Only love for God works the miracle, \nbecause love is beyond mind and reason. Where then is the necessity to read? \nI authoritatively say, I am the Ancient one. I have been saying this to all the world. If you \nlove me with all your heart, you shall be made free eternally. \nThe affairs of the universe continue to go on without being burdensome to me in the least. \nBut the discourses and explanations on the subject of the affairs of the universe are a \nheadache to me. The affairs of the universe continue without my paying special attention to \nthem. They continue to work as naturally as one's breathing, to which one does not have to \npay special attention. But when there is exertion, or when one is pressed to give a discourse \non breathing, one becomes conscious of the act of breathing. \nIn the same way, when it comes to giving explanations, I feel like one who climbs a hill and \nbecomes breathless. Giving you discourses and explanations is burdensome to me. And as \ndiscussions, discourses and explanations are also included in the affairs of the universe, the \nwhole affair becomes more of a burden to me than ever. \nPlaying marbles, gilli-danda, cricket and flying kites are also included in the affairs of the \nuniverse; but these unburden the burden. It is like coming down a hill; it is more of a \nrelaxation than exertion. Jokes and humor are also the things which give me relaxation. But \nwhether I am burdened or relaxed makes no difference, for as I really am, I am beyond all \nthis. \n22? May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina, \nGM p301-302 \nMeher Baba had a discourse read out. \nAfterward, he said through gestures, \nThose who cannot follow this discourse should not worry. Just concentrate on me. Words \nhave no real value. It is good if you can understand. If you do not, why worry? \n22? May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina, \nGM p311 \nDo not give undue importance to explanations and discourses. Words fail to give any \nmeaning to reality - because when one supposes that one has understood, one has not \nunderstood - one is far from understanding anything so far as reality is concerned. \nReality is beyond human understanding, for it is beyond reason. Understanding cannot help, \nbecause God is beyond understanding. \nThe moment you try to understand God, you misunderstand him; you miss him when you \ntry to understand him. Reason must go before knowledge dawns. \n24 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach South Carolina \nGM p315, also PS p109 \nand Aw  5:3 p32-33 \nBefore having a discourse read out, \nBaba said, through gestures, \n'This is short but difficult. Those who cannot follow it must not worry. It's nothing but \nwords. Only love counts. \n'If the most unintelligent one can love me as I ought to be loved, he is infinitely more blessed \nthan the most intelligent one who doesn't know how to love me.' \nAfter the reading, Baba commented, \n'If you listen seven times, there is a chance of your beginning to understand...' \n26 May 1958, \nMyrtle Beach South Carolina, \nGM p328-329 \nThere are two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained through intelligence (using the mind), \nand hidden knowledge (not using the mind). \nA four year old child has to be shown a picture of a table and chair with a word written \nunder the illustration. It is only then that the child can name the objects correctly. \nOn the other hand, an illiterate man knows all about tables and chairs, but does not know \nhow to read and write the words. \n1959, \nto Eruch Jessawala, \nAO p129 \nThe moment you try to understand God rather than try to feel Him, you begin to nourish the \nego and misunderstand God. \nGod is infinite, and the divine will that brought forth this infinite illusion manifests in its \npurity through me. \nDo not try to understand the significance of my actions in the limited context. \nYou see and understand things on your level, and differentiate them in terms of values. I, \nbeing unlimited, know all the levels of consciousness and as such, in responding, I \ndifferentiate in terms of the states of consciousness - whether most rudimentary or most \ninvolved. These states appear like the passing ripples on infinite consciousness. \nEvery moment I respond to the whole creation. Every  action of mine gets spontaneously \nreflected in infinite ways, as per necessity on all the planes of consciousness. So by its very \nnature and magnanimity, sometimes my responses appear enigmatic. To understand them \nis to understand the limitations of your understanding. \nBut if, on the other hand, they create confusion instead, it is because of your lukewarm faith, \nwhich is not as it should be. \nWhen I see you confused, out of my love and compassion I give certain explanations. Thus \nsometimes you see me 'defending' my actions through explanations, giving certain reasons. \nThis depicts my unlimited strength and your weakness. \nBut remember, even though I go on explaining, which forms a part and parcel of my divine \ngame, the significance will ever remain beyond your limited understanding. The utter \nsimplicity of my game appears to be the most intricate as you try to understand it only \nthrough intellect. \nThe more and more you get my sahavas (intimacy) and receive my love with open heart, \nyou begin to understand me more and more. It is also true that the more and more you see \nBaba, you may feel that you understand me less and less. For with the height of \nunderstanding, vast horizons are revealed, and you feel helpless in understanding my game. \nSo leave all doubts, and remember well that whatever I do is for the best. It is the divine \nresponse filled with love divine.\" \nApril, May or June 1959, \nPoona? \nGl November 1984, p5 \nWhat can you achieve through talks? Reading also does not help. Any amount of reading or \nhearing has no value. \nReal understanding comes in a flash. \n23 October 1959, \nMeherazad, Aw 10:4 p23 \nOne may be an intellectual genius, but unless he realises the Truth, his so-called knowledge \nis nothing but a play of words in ignorance. His interpretations of life and commentaries on \nTruth can lead you only so far and as much as one blind man leading another. \nApril, May or June 1960 \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nDa p11 \nBy studying Vedanta, you may become intellectually convinced about such logical \ndeductions as 'I am God' and 'Everyone is God.' But of what avail is such dry knowledge? \nLove is the way, and it is only the experience of the I-am-God state that solves all questions \nonce and for all. Such an experience is not child's play. Cycles and cycles have to roll on \nbefore one becomes eligible to experience the real answer. \nApril, May or June 1960 \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nDa p28 \nYou have read much of spiritual literature. You are well-known for your lucid expositions. \nSpiritual understanding takes one nearer the Path, but remember well that the experience \nof the Path is quite a different matter. The higher states of consciousness can never be \nimagined through book-knowledge. \nAs one travels the spiritual Path, one comes across varied experiences, such as visions, \nsweet notes of sound, and delightful scents. In the more advanced stages, one can \ndetachedly watch his body moving about. The many experiences that one has on the Path \nare not lasting, but the experience in which one becomes what he is in reality is perennial. \nThen in whatever thoughts or actions such a one may seem to be engaged, maya cannot \ntouch him. In that state, everything is experienced in its infinite intensity. How can spiritual \nunderstanding derived from books imagine this state? Intellect is bound to fail to fathom \nthis experience. \nTo an engineer, \nApril, May or June 1960, \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nDa p29 \nmaya = the principle of ignorance \nIf you read 'God Speaks' you will know the details about the different states and stages of \nconsciousness. \nAlso, you must bear in mind that mere intellectual understanding has very little value by \nitself. Whether one understands the details of the Path or not, it is just the same. Only love \ncounts. \nTo learn God is to unlearn yourself. \nTo a Shastri (Sanskrit scholar), \nApril, May or June 1960, \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nDa p52 \nWhen you are in my sahavas, be fully attentive and receptive to what I say -- but no \nquestioning. Love me and be silent. \nPampering of the intellect brings forth innumerable questions. All these questions can be \nanswered, but that is hardly spiritually indispensable. Mere intellectual explanations will \nnot take you out of your internal muddle, but will all the more puzzle you. Very rare persons \nhave the necessary acumen. \nTry to grasp what I have already stated. The more you love me, the less you question. Love \nanswers all questions, for it ignores questioning itself. \nTo a group of his followers from \nMadhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh \nApril, May or June 1960, \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nDa p58 \nsahavas = company \nRead 'God Speaks' -- you can grasp it. If you understand it properly, you will find that there \nis nothing in the world to worry about. Whatever happens, happens due to impressions or \nsanskaras. Sanskaras make the dream of creation appear to be real and lasting, and they \ncreate undue worries... \nIf you read 'God Speaks' you will have a wider view of the spiritual panorama of the divine \ndrama, which reveals the secret of creation. The entire creation is a game of love, or 'lila,' \nwhich God enjoys at his own cost. \nTo a film director, \nApril, May or June 1960 \nGuruprasad, Poona, \nDa p64, 67 \nUnderstanding Book Two \nIndex - Book One \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

Later he would write his notes out in longhand, often \nstaying up until midnight with his compilation. The next day he would hand Baba the recent \nexplanations for corrections. Baba would peruse them, and usually after nine days return \nthem with his remarks. Chanji would then type Baba's explanations in their final form.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM3 p857 (1926, Meherabad) \n\"You find these discourses of mine very interesting, but they are nothing compared to what \nI have written in my book* at Meherabad. Its 300 pages cover only short points, and when \nthey are fully amplified and rewritten, the points will comprise several large volumes. It is \nfull of secrets which no previous saint, Prophet or Avatar has ever divulged.\" \nMeher Baba, 26 November 1926, to Chanji, LM3 p878 \n*A book Baba wrote by hand that has not yet been published. \n\"Someone asked Baba, would it not be advisable to send his notes and explanations and \nlectures to someone to edit and put in good shape for people's reading. \n\"'No,' Baba replied, 'it would not be advisable to send them to anyone outside - such a writer \nwould have to be here in order to ensure correctness. Kaikobad (Dastur) here, the other \nday, took notes of some of my explanations, but when he put them into his own language he \nmade a mess of it all. \n\"'My explanations and lectures may be recomposed in forceful and stylish language, but the \nspirit and meaning must remain unchanged. Such a writer will come in the due course of \ntime. \n\"'Dastur writes well, but his uncompromising tone and terms are likely to offend some \ncommunities. \n\"'The big book I have written will be the future Bible, Koran, Avesta and Veda, as it will be \nuniversally accepted by all castes and creeds. I have stopped writing anything after finishing \nthis great work, and hence it has force.'\" \n7 August 1927, Meherabad, SW p403-404 and LM3 p953-954 \nFive weeks later Baba was asked why he would not yet let anyone read the book. He \nanswered: \n\"One must be prepared to read what I have written. It would be dangerous in one respect: if \nthis intellectual knowledge is imparted, at times the desire for God-realisation and \nexperiencing that state vanishes, and the aspirant is only satisfied with what he knows \nintellectually or sees. Then the desire for union does not remain as keen. \n\"Suppose there is a vast treasure, or something of great worth, beyond imagination, and \nthere is a curtain between your room and it. This reading and intellectual knowledge would \nbe equal to a literal explanation given by the one who has seen or experienced these things. \nYou yourself don't see the treasure behind the curtain, but have only read about it or heard \nit described.\" \n14 September 1927, Meherabad, LM3 p965 \n\"Meher Baba dictated his book 'God Speaks' in different languages in an unusual fashion. He \nused mainly English, but he mixed in Marathi, Gujerati and Persian words, and I used to \nwrite down his dictation exactly as he gave it. Each line of his dictation therefore contained \na mixture of words from different languages, and since this was all done by way of gestures, \nit required an enormous amount of concentration to catch every gesture for each language \nword while trying at the same time to capture the sense of what he was conveying. Later, \nwhen Baba was otherwise occupied, and I could find the time to work from the dictated \nnotes, I had to put the whole thing into English without losing any of the meaning... \nI remember having difficulty with a certain item which I mentioned to him one cold night in \nMahabaleshwar, when he was lying in bed with a blanket over him. He smiled at me and \nsaid, 'Look here, Eruch, the theme of God is like this: the whole thing is like the pattern you \nsee on this blanket. And if you want to know how this pattern is formed, how can I explain it \nto you? I can't show you in any other way than by pulling out the pattern.' \n\"Then he took hold of one of the strands between his thumb and forefinger, and said, 'Look \nhere. I'm pulling it out now to show you how the pattern is formed and to explain it to you. \nBut the more I pull out the strand, what you will find is that instead of giving you a better \npicture, the pattern will begin to dissolve. As long as the pattern is there, you are able to say \nthis is the blanket. But there won't be a blanket if I start to pull out the strands. There will \nonly be strands, and the pattern won't be there either. So the subject of God is, there is \nnothing but God, and all else is illusion. There is only God.\" \nIn spite of my difficulties at times, Baba was very patient. He was patience personified, and \nwhenever I found myself unable to follow his fingers on the board or his hand gestures, he \nwould constantly repeat them with infinite patience until I made headway. Often when our \nshort-sightedness or lack of understanding or other shortcomings led us into putting \nquestions to Baba, he would tell us, 'God Speaks is not the whole truth. It is only a part of the \ntruth, for anything at all is nothing but a part of the truth, including anything that anyone \nsays. There is nothing but God, and anything that you find is illusion, that is, other than God. \nAnd that is God's pattern.'\" \nEruch Jessawala (c.1954?) AO p127-128 \n\"Baba once made the point to me that we should study his discourses and writings \ndiligently, because during his lifetime they held 'spark.' I gathered that this meant that they \nwould ignite the flame in people's sleeping hearts. \n\"He said that his aura would remain in the world for one hundred years after he gave up the \nbody, but after that the writings would not have so great a force - that they would become \nscriptures, in the same way that what he had said in past Avataric incarnations have become \nscriptures.\" \nIvy Duce, HMp 206 \nI was about two thirds of the way through re-editing Dr.Deshmukh's edition of the \nDiscourses... \nOn this particular occasion we were discussing some of the things in the Discourses, and I \njust tossed off that I was just not sure that this was ever going to be particularly used, as \nthere were so many people that feel that it is impossible to embody the realities of spiritual \nattainments in words, that words can actually detract -- even Baba's words. \nBaba looked at me as though He had just heard the most extraordinary thing. He look \nabsolutely aghast. He said, \n\"But Don how could people ever feel that way about Baba's words?\" \nHe said, \n\"As Baba works on these words that He gives out He attaches to each word a spiritual \nenergy of great quantity, great proportion, and the individual who takes the trouble, even \nwithout understanding, to read Baba's words, taps into this gift of spiritual energy which \nthe Avatar has attached to his own words.\" \nThen he looked at me and said, \n\"It is your responsibility, Don, to impress upon the people that you are around that Baba has \ndone this, and this spiritual gift that Baba has attached to His words will help them \nenormously in their own spiritual ongoing.\" \nMeher Baba Association Newsletter \nNovember 1997, p6 \ned.

    "text": "WORKING FOR MEHER BABA \nMeher Baba \nANDHRA, 1954 \nSATARA, 1954 \nMEHERABAD, 1955 \nNEW YORK, 1956 \nMYRTLE BEACH, 1956 \nPOONA, 1957 \nAHMEDNAGAR, 1962 \nPOONA, 1962 \nANDHRA, 1954 \nMeher Baba called a meeting of male workers for his 'cause' in Rajamundry, Andhra,  March \n1, 1954. At 9 p.m. Baba served each man a cup of coffee. He communicated in English using \nan alphabet board which was read out by one of the Mandali. What Baba 'said' in English \nwas continually translated into Telegu by one of the men. These are partial notes from that \nmeeting. \nBaba: Now, today is no political or social meeting, but a meeting for the divine cause, and \nthis meeting reminds me of my previous meetings during my previous incarnations. It has \nnever been truer than in the spiritual cause that history repeats itself. During those periods \nthe circumstances were different, but same God and same cause. The apostles, the asahaabs \nwho worked for my cause, did it at the cost of everything, even life itself. \nI am just introducing. The real points will begin after the introduction is over, so listen very \ncarefully. Mass darshan at Hamirpur, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra and Dehra Dun has been \nenough now. And I tell you as gospel truth with divine authority that these programs, \nmessages, addresses, mean nothing in the spiritual Path. My arti, my pujas, garlanding me, \nbowing down to me, absolutely mean nothing. From ages eternal, gods have been doing my \npuja. So why all this unnecessary waste of money through garlands, fruits and offerings? \nWhat I want is real work done. \n(Ranga Rao and a few others had been in a car accident, and some people believed Baba had \nmiraculously saved them from injury) \nRanga Rao, what saved you is not I. This meeting saved you all. What I want to say is, by \nattributing such miracles to me, people make me very cheap, and lower my status as the \nhighest of the high. This I say today: the moment I break my silence and utter that original \nword, the first and last miracle of Baba in this life will be performed. It will be a miracle as I \nhave never performed. I won't raise the dead, but I will make those who live for the world, \ndead to the world, and alive in God. I won't give sight to the blind, but will make those who \nsee illusion blind to illusion, to see God as reality. \nIntroduction is over. Now the real point starts, which you must, each and all, listen to very \ncarefully. It is about work. You have been called workers. You must understand what work \nis. You Andhra workers, big and small, rich and poor, have done your best to make the \nprograms successful. I know that. This I say with happiness, that you have tried to express \nyour love to me by spreading my messages of love. But somehow I feel something very \nwrong deep-rooted. \nIt is natural that amongst workers of any cause, political, social, spiritual, there may be \ndifferences of opinion - and not only differences of opinion, but also competition, jealousies \n- which lead to absolute breakdown of the basis of the work. Now, you are working for Baba. \nIs it necessary? If I am highest of the high and God incarnate, where is the necessity for me \nin my work to have all these entanglements, organisations, messages, this and that? \nIf I am not the infinite one, but just one like you, then thousands of such programs will be of \nno avail. Can I not in my silent way do the universal work myself? Because if I am Baba, \nwhich definitely I am, if the whole world goes against me or worships me, it is all the same \nto me. The only reason, maybe, why I call work and my workers, is to make you share the \ndivine cause. And if you are prepared to share in my work, it must be done 100% honestly. \nYou must work for me, my message of love. How, I will explain. \nFirst of all, you should not at all seek or even expect appreciations from me or from others - \nand this sounds so easy while just dictated, but is almost impossible. Work in itself is its \nown appreciation. The moment you seek appreciation, the work is undone. It is true, some \nof you may be ready to work for me and my cause 100%. Yet because some of you have \nbeen poor and have large families, you cannot devote your time and your means for my \nwork. But why work when beyond your means? Why depend upon some help to make you \nwork for me? The moment the worker depends upon anything or anyone, the work is \nundone. Do as much as you can do, but do it honestly. \nI have heard that people have been complaining about money being collected, money being \nused, money being spent but not accounted for. If this is true, stop all work. One penny, one \npie* extracted in my name without true basis is dishonesty. (*pie = a very small Indian coin) \nSo today I want every one of you to pour out your hearts, and let us decide once and for all \nto work or to stop it. My dear friends, if you want to make people love me, show them that \nyou really love me. Don't merely make them read my books and messages, but live a life of \nsacrifice for me, that they may automatically love me. \nLast time when I visited Andhra I appointed KDRM four as pillars of my work in Andhra. K is \nKutumba Shastri, D is Dr. Dhanipathirao, R is Ranga Rao, and M is Mallikarjanarao. I know \neach of you four love me wholeheartedly and work for me wholeheartedly, no doubt. But \nnow I find it must be my own mistake in forgetting that north, south, west and east cannot \nmeet at any point - four in different directions. So first let us find out if the four can work \ntogether or not as I want. So pour out your hearts to me honestly without any curtain. This \nwill make me say something very original and lasting for all. Don't look at each other or fear \neach other. \n(The four men each told Baba about their problems and disagreements) \nBaba: I have not understood myself what work you are doing for me. If you are doing only \npropaganda, it is absurd. I don't want mere propaganda, or any kind of false publicity, never. \nLove and honesty I want. If you all cannot do that, then stop what you call work. I am quite \ncapable of doing my work. So today I think we must try to stop the so-called work, that is \nhow I think. \nI have often said that I have not yet found one who could love me. There are about 220 men \nand women from East and West who have surrendered to me in such a way as to do \nanything I say. It is a fact. For example, Eruch. He is intelligent, has a good heart. If I order \nhim to do anything, he will try 100%, even to cut himself to pieces. Pendu, Meherjee, \nMandali who are with me since years together, they all are the same. Each of these 220 \nMandali would lay down their lives. What I want to point out is, to surrender is higher than \nto love. And paradoxical as it may seem, to love me is impossible, but to obey me is possible, \nthough very difficult. So to call yourself my workers and yet not to obey is hypocritical. \n(Manik - Y. Manikyala Rao - got so excited criticising KDRM that he would not stop talking, \neven when Baba asked him to be quiet. Baba sent him out of the hall for five minutes. A little \nlater, Baba had the Prayer of Repentance read out while he and all the men stood. Then \nBaba served each man another cup of coffee.) \nBaba (to Manik): Your enthusiasm and love led you astray. I understand you wanted to \nspread my name through the books, and you did it with the best of motives, but no tact. You \ndid not observe the principle. Did you see how my confessing tonight for our weakness was \ndone? How I became the confessor on your behalf? Even when I appear to act, not only do I \nact the part, but I become that part. I confessed now wholeheartedly, did it for the whole \nuniverse, but became the one who confesses. My own principles I do not break. I am free, \nbut principle must be maintained. \nQ. Without money, how is propaganda possible? \nBaba: It is without money only that Baba's real work can be done. Why propaganda? The \nword makes me look down. What will you tell people? Suppose you have a lot of money, \nhow will you propagate my mission? My work ages ago was done without money, \nabsolutely. As soon as the money question appeared, Judas sold me. \nI will now make my points clear. I know KDRM are not dishonest. K is very cautious about \nmoney, I know that. D has some money. R has no money, M the same. So it is natural that \nthey think that for Baba's work they must have money. But to depend upon money for \nBaba's work, and to extract money from others for Baba's work, is absolute dishonesty from \nmy point of view. \nNow I will tell you about money and what I think about it. From the day I kept silence, I even \nstopped writing, I even stopped touching money. But from that day till today, you have no \nidea how much money flowed past through my hands. Yet I have not a pie (small coin) with \nme. I am a fakir, but money passes by me, it comes and goes. But if you depend upon money \nfor my work, then do not work for me, because how will you get money? Let us be very \npractical. \nK: I feel it is the life we lead. \nBaba: Very good. Live such a life which makes others love me. Show them that you love me. \nTo ask people to give you money, and then you would in turn propagate Baba, how does it \nsound? So I think that unless you have anything else to suggest, the four of you, stop what \nyou call work, and live the life of love, and by your living let others come to me. If you want \nto come to compromise, then there will be dishonesty. \nKatta Subharao will say, 'I am not a fool. I can do Baba's work independently. Who are \nKDRM?' Kovvur people will say, 'We are capable of spreading Baba's love. Why must we be \ndominated by KDRM?' And so forth with others. \nRemember, in my sixty years of life of this form, this is the first time such a meeting, where I \ndiscussed the details, has been attended by me. Not even in Hamirpur was such a meeting \ncalled. But because I felt something is seriously wrong, I called it. Absolute honesty or no \nBaba. I am Baba, I know it. Let KDRM be dissolved. Have you anything to suggest? Am I \nunjust in dissolving KDRM? \n(Each of the four was asked 'Am I unjust in dissolving KDRM?' and each said no. Baba then \nsaid he had decided to dissolve KDRM, dissolve the centers, and said that everyone could \nbecome a Baba-center.) \nBaba: I know definitely I love Andhra, and Andhra people have expressed their love in a way \nto touch my heart. Every one of you who is here tonight loves me, I know. So I feel very \nhappy. The unique love expressed by all Andhras during all small and big programs has \nreally touched me very deeply. Now once again I will confess before God, whoever he be, \nour weaknesses on behalf of you all, because the Elluru people were not here when I \nconfessed the first time tonight. After the confession, if you really love me even a little, I \nwant your hearts towards each other to be clean. Forget your past differences, clean your \nhearts, and live for Baba if you love Baba. \n(One of the men asked how Baba's messages would reach them once the centers were \ndissolved.) \nBaba: You are all the workers of Baba. Those who can afford money can go from place to \nplace, tell people about my messages of love. Those who have little money can go round \ntheir own town, and by living the life of love, convert others to love for God. Those who have \nno money, large family and no time, they should convert their own houses to Baba's love. So \nthen no centers, no offices, no accounts, people won't be asked for money, and Baba's love \nwill be there. Is that not right? \n(One of the men asked Baba if they could correspond with him after the centers were \nclosed. Baba told him that he was stopping all correspondence. The man said, 'For others' \nfault, we have to suffer.') \nBaba: It is no one's fault. It may be your fault, who knows? Is there anyone without \nweaknesses, defects and faults? \n(One of the men said, \"Only one, Baba. Baba, you are that one. Baba means God.\") \nBaba: God means all-knowing, all present. So I am in everyone and know everything. So it is \nmy fault, whose else is it? I know everything, I am everything, and I do everything, so there \nis no fault. If I am God as you say, then there is no one's fault. If I am not God, then there is \nno one in the whole universe except myself who is at fault. \nKatta Subarao, I am now fed up with this board and the silence. I must break silence before I \ndrop the body, and when I break silence, you all who have come into contact with me will \nhave some glimpse of me. Some small, some big, some little more. When the electric power-\nhouse switches on its main switch, wherever the connection and the bulb is, it is lighted. If \nthe bulb is small, you get low candle light. If a high power bulb, high light. But if the bulb is \nfused, there will be no light. That is why I said that I have performed no miracle, but when I \nbreak my silence, the first and last of the greatest of all miracles will be performed. Love me \nwholeheartedly, that is the only thing. Love me, love me, love me, and you find me. \n(Baba had the Prayer of Repentance read out for the second time, followed by a message he \nhad recently dictated, 'Existence is substance and life is shadow,' in English. Then the Telegu \ntranslation was read out. Baba dictated instructions to Mouna Swami about a forty day fast \nthat he had ordered him to undertake.) \nBaba: From you Andhras, I want nothing. No surrender, no obedience, no mind, no body, no \npossessions. I want only love. \n(Baba left around 2.35 a.m., and told the Mandali and workers to go to bed after 3 a.m.) \n(The next morning Baba had the workers gather again in the hall) \nBaba: Summing up last night's proceedings, I want to make some points very clear. I have \ndissolved KDRM, and as I said last night, officially I won't be concerned with any of the \nAndhra Meher centers. Even about books and all other literature about Baba, I won't be \nresponsible or have any concern. \nWhat I want is, those who really love me and want to work for me should each become a \nBaba center. How those who can afford, and how those who cannot afford can work for me, \nhas been explained by me last night. In villages and in your own houses, that is your concern \nand not mine. \nAs I said last night, now I will have to work out alone my own program of silence and \nbreaking the silence, so I won't be bothered with any correspondence. Now this dissolution \nof KDRM and Andhra Meher Centers might mean complications for those directly \nconcerned, complications regarding office, publications, etc. Therefore I have ordered Adi to \nhelp you to clear the difficulties. You can all, if you like, correspond with Adi, Eruch, Pendu, \nand with any one of the Mandali. \nBut I order them, the Mandali, now, that not one word of the letters you write to them \nshould be brought to my ears. So if Mandali advise you, when asked by you, don't take the \nadvice as from me. They will definitely advise you for the best, because they have been long \nwith me, yet do not take their advice as from me. If you find difficulty to clear out and close \nmatters dealing with publications, books, etc., do ask Adi's advice and help. I have ordered \nhim to help you all, but I will have no concern with what he advises you. \nCertain complications about publications, or Meher Publications Andhra, which was \npersonally entrusted to Mallikarjana Rao, are bound to arise on my dissolving Meher \nPublications Andhra. There will be difficulty to get over this problem unless helped by Adi. \nAdi should therefore help Mallik in such a way that Mallik is not put in an awkward position. \nBut let everything be done and executed honestly. \nI will have no concern whatsoever with either office or publications, whether this goes on or \nis stopped. It is the lookout of you four. Even if KDRM of their own want to continue, I have \nnothing to do. You can add, subtract, or be zero. I will have no concern. I am the servant and \nthe Master simultaneously. \nAsk Adi or any one of the Mandali to advise you and help you in your difficulties, because \nthey know my ways. You can trust them not to mislead you purposely. But after asking them \nfor advice and help, you should also think of it yourself, for after all, Mandali are not Baba. \nLet me now see how you love Baba and how you work for Baba. I am everywhere and I am \nin you also, to see you. Now ask me something if you like. Ask me about your difficulties. \nQ. What about our failings regarding spirituality? \nBaba: I tell you that no one has failed. You love me wholeheartedly. When love is not at its \nheight, it always creates a mess. There is no question of failing. I am very happy with you all. \nAs I said last night, this is the first time I held such a meeting for the divine cause in sixty \nyears of my life. If only you had a little glimpse of my divinity, all doubts would have \nvanished, and love, real love, established. \nIllusion has such a tight grip that we forget reality. After 100 years this form you won't have, \nand yet today you don't feel this truth. If yesterday's accident to KDRM would have taken \nthem away from this world and killed them, this muddle which is in their mind now, this \nmoment, would not have been there. So KDRM, think that you are dead, and from now on \nyou only live for me. \nVenkateswara Rao: We are prodigal children, and not up to the mark. Give us help through \nAdi; that is my prayer. \nBaba: Let us be very honest, absolutely honest. Adi has been with me like the few tested \nMandali for a long period, and he has been doing office work for twenty years 100%. And \neven then, as I said, no one of my Mandali is Baba. Everyone has got weaknesses and \ndefects. Advice you can have from Adi, but not as from Baba through Adi. \nAnnapurniah (editor of the weekly newspaper 'Velegu'): Will the Andhra lovers be informed \nof the time and place of Baba's breaking silence? \nBaba: My dear 'Velegu,' if this is what is meant by breaking silence, it would be better I don't \nbreak it. All will know. Just as I told you last night, the power-house is to be switched on, \nand all connected with it will be lighted, so it will not be only here, but it will be throughout \nthe world. But bulbs not working or fused will not be giving the light. \nThat is why I have been telling you all to love me more and more. All this talk of books, \nliterature, is good for preparing the ground. But the time for the power-house to be \nswitched on is so near that the only thing that will count now is love. \nAgain I say, if you want to make Andhra love me, and make them feel my love for them, then \nit is in your own individual hands to do so. This does not mean that you must necessarily \nwork individually - I never said that. I say, each one of you be a Baba center, or you can \nwork in groups as Baba centers. But all the same, I will have no concern with any centers. \nThis does not mean that you should not work on your own. I have now shown you how to \nwork. But bear in mind, it is now all your own responsibility. You can establish 100 centers \nfor Baba, and I will have no concern with any of them. You yourself will be concerned with \nthem. It is all your concern and not mine. \nBut do bear in mind this much: that those who really want to work for me should live the \nlife of Baba's lovers. That is, show people how you love Baba, and then you will have Baba-\nlovers all around you. \nI want money-less love. \nOnly remember that although I do not perform miracles, I will give anything to whoever \nasks for it from the bottom of his heart. If I am Baba, I can do anything. You ask \nwholeheartedly, and you will get it from me. But this I tell you too, that the one who asks for \nmy love will be the chosen one. \nTime is very near when I will break my silence, and then, within a short period, all will \nhappen: my humiliation, my glorification, my manifestation, and my dropping the body. All \nthat will happen soon, and in a short period. So from this moment, love me more and more. \nDon't do false propaganda. What your heart says, your conscience says about me, pour out \nwithout hesitation. Be unmindful of whether you are ridiculed or accepted in pouring out \nyour heart for me to others. \nIf you take Baba as God, say so; don't hesitate. If you think Baba is the devil, say it out; don't \nbe afraid. I am everything that you take me to be, and I am also beyond everything. Then \nwhy hesitate to say out or be afraid to express what you feel and what you think of me? Say \nit out frankly. I am both. But do not overrule your conscience, and do not exaggerate merely \nfor propaganda. \nIf your conscience says that Baba is the Avatar, say it even if you are killed for it. But if you \nfeel I am not that, then say that you feel Baba is not the Avatar. Do not fear, but be prepared \nto say out what you feel. On my own account, I say again and again, I am the ancient one, the \nhighest of the high. \nMeher Baba, \n1-2 March 1954, Rajamundry, Andhra, \nAD p112-123 \nAnother version: GG5 p236-259 \nBack to top \nSATARA, 1954 \nO my lovers, I love you all. It is only because of my love for my creation that I have \ndescended on earth. Let not your hearts be torn asunder by my declarations concerning the \ndropping of my body. On the contrary, accept my divine will cheerfully. You can never \nescape from me. Even if you try to escape from me, it is not possible to get rid of me. \nTherefore have courage and be brave. \nIf you thus lose your hearts, how will it be possible for you to fulfill the great task which I \nhave entrusted to you? Be brave and spread my message of love far and wide to all quarters \nin order to fulfill my divine will. Let the words 'Baba, Baba' come forth from every nook and \ncorner of the world, and from the mouth of every child, and let their ignorance be reduced \nto ashes by the burning flame of my love. \nCome together in order to fulfill my will by taking your stand on truth, love and honesty, \nand be worthy of participating in my task. I give you all my blessings for spreading my \nmessage of love. \nMeher Baba, \n8 October 1954, \nSatara, circular letter, \ntranslated from Hindi by C.D. Deshmukh, \nAw 21:2 p1 \nBack to top \nMEHERABAD, 1955 \nWherever I go, people flock about me by the hundreds and thousands. That kind of love is \nnot what I want. Whether people worship or villify me, I remain what I am. Whether the \nwhole world believes in God or denies him, God always remains God. I look forward to the \nlove which enables the individual to obey me, so that he may find me and eventually \nbecome me. Therefore I do not want merely crowds to be attracted towards me. I want \nreally sincere souls. I do not necessarily wait for them to come to me - I often go to them. I \ncan - and do - do my own work. You can - and should - share it too. \nIt is easy to collect crowds, and it is easy for crowds to collect. My greatness cannot be \nestablished in the crowds and through the crowds. But even a few with love can make the \nmasses feel my greatness, and keep the greatness established in their hearts. One single \nperson who really loves me can move the whole world. \nThere is no one here, including myself, who can so love me. If all of you became my real \nlovers, we would need several more worlds for all of you to work in for me. \nMy work for you does not consist in your going around beating a big drum for me. Love \nneeds no propaganda. You need love yourself in order to propagate love among others. To \nspread my love among the people, you have to make them understand me as you \nunderstand me. For that you have to bring them to love me as you love me. And that means \nyou have to cause them to feel my love as you feel it. The best way is to show others by your \nown example how much you love me. \nThe world is too full of preachers and teachers. Never forget that I have not come to teach, \nand I need no preachers. \nIn the intimate spirit of the sahavas, I must be free and frank with you and tell you whatever \nI feel like saying. Why shout to others, 'Baba says God is the only reality, and all else is \nillusion,' when you yourself cannot help whispering to me about your own illusions? \nThere are doubtless many among you here who are sincere and painstaking in your efforts \nto explain my message to one and all, that they should ignore illusion and awaken to reality. \nYet these sincere workers do not hesitate to bring to my attention their own tales of illusory \nwoes and worries, such as 'Baba, I am short of money,' 'My wife is not in good health,' 'I am \nabout to lose my job,' 'There is trouble in my business,' and so on. Would it be truthful for \none of these to tell others, 'Baba says, do not worry about illusory things. God knows \neverything and God does everything'? Why preach at all what you yourself cannot put into \npractice? \nIf you do not find yourself free of falsehood, envy, slander, backbiting and hatred, and if you \nfind in yourself lack of love and consideration for others, then instead of telling others Baba \nsays this and Baba says that, you had best keep quiet and not show your face to those whom \nyou would like to win over to me. \nSuppose one of my followers is speaking before a gathering, and trying to tell them that \nBaba is reality and all else is illusion. Suppose that just then a telegram is given to him \nwhich tells of a bus accident in which all of his family have been killed. If, in spite of the \ntragedy and pain of what has happened, he continues to speak with greater conviction, then \nhe has achieved real authority to speak about me and my teachings. \nYou win the right to tell others what you first accept in letter and spirit for yourself. Show \noutwardly only what you have won inwardly. \nThere is no doubt, for example, that I am the Avatar, the Ancient one. But how do you know \nthat I am he? You say so mainly because I say so. I say so based on my own living experience \nof being that. But for you it is just a belief until you become me. Suppose your belief is \nwrong? \nWhat I want to impress upon you is this: never give a twist to what you feel deep down in \nyour own hearts. If you feel I am the Avatar, say openly 'Baba is the Avatar.' If you feel I am a \nfraud, do not hesitate to say 'Baba is a fraud.' I remain unaffected by praise or abuse. If you \nspeak what you feel to be true, you have the force of truth to make others accept truth. \nHonest differences between workers laboring in a common cause are signs of the vitality of \nthe work. But a spirit of discipline is also essential in all creative activities of life. How can \npeople work jointly without discipline? And on the other hand, where would there be scope \nfor self-control and discipline if there were no differences between workers? \nYour eyes, ears, nose and mouth are placed in different positions to serve varying purposes. \nThey also appear different in size and shape, and yet all are equally yours. Besides serving \nspecific direct purposes, all your organs are also complementary to each other, and in this \nrespect equally valuable to you. There is no question of one organ competing with another \nfor supremacy of position, or service to the body. Each serves in its individual capacity, and \nall harmonise in the smooth functioning of the whole body. \nDifferences between workers who toil in the cause of love and truth can either accentuate \nor mutilate them for other persons, and for the workers as well. Therefore differences must \nbe properly harmonised and fairly adjusted with the aid of discipline, which is more to be \nlived sincerely within oneself than enforced upon others. \nBut neither differences nor discipline should ever be raised above love and truth. They \nshould be sacrificed rather than be allowed to mar or cloud the main object. A body without \na soul is best buried, burned or disposed of as quickly as possible. No one would like to die \nto save one's eyes or ears. \nYour love for me should have free expression in the mode or form best suited to you. It \nshould shine through you to others, awakening their hearts to receive this divine gift. \nGatherings and meetings in my name should be a channel for the expression of my love, and \nto give them any other importance is to misunderstand my cause. \nOrganisations may be necessary for carrying out work of a routine nature. But if I am the \nAvatar, I need no such things for my own work. \nAlthough I would not be worth loving if I were not aware of someone's unexpressed love for \nme, why should anyone who wishes to express it be compelled to do so through some office \nor organisation? \nMy office should be the heart of everyone who loves me. The heart of each should be my \nshrine, and my lover the priest of that temple of love. Such a temple comes first, and the \npriest afterwards. A cart placed before the horse can serve no purpose. Love, and the heart \nwhich has love, are of greater importance than questions of the position or prestige of those \nwho choose to take up my work. \nA heavy railway train with two engines pulling it in the same direction is quickly moved up \na steep grade. But a few cars pulled by two engines straining in opposite directions cannot \nmake progress even on level ground. \nForget the past, and make the most of the present. Keep your own hearts clean. Learn to \nlove each other first, before you tell others about my love for one and all. Give love, receive \nlove, gather love. Everything else is dissolved eventually in the truth of divine love. \nLet your own life of love for Baba be the message of Baba's love for one and all. \nMeher Baba, \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLH p70-74 \nWork undertaken with honest intent and love is Baba's work. Such worker's are Baba's \nmen. The greatest work one can do for Baba is to live the life of love, humility, sincerity and \nselfless service, in which there is not a trace of the slightest hypocrisy. \nBaba's love is for all, and for each of Baba's lovers to live the life of selfless service - show an \nexample to others - this satisfies Baba. Such a life and such a love are vital in Baba's work. \nThey carry the weight of the highest responsibility because they really and truly carry \nBaba's love and message to others - much more than, and in contrast to, mere words. \nTake for example A... He is good at heart. He goes to his place, tells of Baba and his \ngreatness. 'Baba is Avatar. Love Baba. Leave the world, it is all illusion, etc., etc.' He also \nshouts 'Avatar Meher Baba ki jai.' Suddenly a wire comes saying there was a bus accident \nand that his family died. What happens? As soon as he reads the telegram, he starts \nfumbling and does not know what to do. What would those who saw him and listened to \nhim think? That force with which he spoke about Baba and lectured (before he got the sad \nnews) is gone... \nIn that way, whatever you say to others, do it yourself. Otherwise it is better not to say \nanything to anyone. \nTake another example: B. goes to a different place. He says, 'Meher Baba is Avatar. Don't get \nangry, as Baba says we should not get angry. You will get thoughts of anger, but do not \nexpress them in words or action.' All are pleased and shout 'Avatar Meher Baba ki jai.' \nSuppose someone in the meeting hits B., and B. gets angry and abuses and hits back. Here \nBaba's man has expressed anger, and all his lecture was mere talk. Therefore the actual life \nyou live must be a real example. Better not to tell anyone anything of Baba that you cannot \ndo yourself. However hard you work to collect a crowd, will it enhance Baba's greatness? \nCrowds you can gather, but crowds will never prove the greatness of Baba... \nEven if there are only a few selected ones who can love Baba, and who, by the example of \nthe actual life they live, can create love for Baba and spread his message of love - that will be \nreal work for Baba. Let your own life be my message of love for others. \nThe last time I went to Rajamundry I had a meeting of workers. I told what work meant and \nwhat workers should do. I dissolved the KDRM group. I dissolved the so-called centers and \norganisations. Every heart that loves me is my ashram. Only by living one's life as a true \nBaba-lover can one do my work. \nThen some of you workers wanted a center. In the days of my seclusion, you formed a \ncenter, and later some differences arose between you. However, let the past be past. Don't \nlook back. Forget the past. All of you love me. That alone will not do. You must love each \nother too. You must practise in your life what you preach. To gather crowds is no good and \nof no use. There must be trust and love between you. If you can do such work, do the work. \nOtherwise it is better you do no work at all. \nLet every heart of a lover be a shrine for Baba, and you yourself are Poojari for that shrine. \nOne very good thing I want to say. If you all follow it, all difficulties will be solved. To the \nmembers of the committee: love one another amongst you. Then let them speak of love to \nothers. I tell also every individual lover the same thing. You yourself first establish love \nwithin yourself. If you can follow my instructions, even if you are a lover outside the \ncommittee, you can do Baba's work better. Only when you love and trust one another can \nyou tell others of Baba's love. \nForget the past. For the future, let love and trust prevail. If you dare to love me, those lovers \nwho are not included in the committee, you can show the committee that you can do better \nand do more than this committee. Don't think that any member of the committee is greater \nthan any individual lover outside the committee. You too (who are not in the committee) \ncan do Baba's work of spreading his love. \nFor Baba, what is important is love and heart. Not wealth or prestige or intelligence. If there \nis heart and head both, it is ideal and exceptional. Love, head, heart and wealth all together \nis practical and exceptional. \nMeher Baba, \nNovember 1955, \nMeherabad, \nLJ p77-81 \nAnother (partial) version: LB p63-65 \nBack to top \nNEW YORK, 1956 \nQ. Have you heard of an American evangelist by the name of Billy Graham? Have you met \nand spoken with him? \nBaba: No. \nQ. Have you heard of his work? \nBaba: I know. \nQ. Can you tell us what you think of his work? \nBaba: Any work done in the name of God or Lord Jesus is a good work. But it must be done \nsincerely, honestly, without taking any pride in it, without wanting to profit through it. \n23 July 1956, \nNew York, \nin answer to a reporter's \nquestions at a press conference, \nAw 4:3 p18 \nBack to top \nMYRTLE BEACH, 1956 \nNotes from a meeting, 29 July 1956, Myrtle Beach, a little after 8 am. Filis Frederick wrote: \n'After pacing rapidly about for a few moments, he settled himself in a wicker chair under a \npine tree, and we all seated ourselves facing him on the dark brown tanbark for the meeting \non the groups that had been postponed from the night before.' \nBaba: \"Last evening I told John Bass and others that in India there are many groups. Each \nhas a group head, and all work for the love of me. All love me. The group heads are \nresponsible for the work the group does. In India, in the different groups, there are different \ncastes, different religions, those of different economic status. There are Sikhs, Muslims, \nHindus... but all love Baba. All want to work for me, and to spread my message of love and \ntruth. Muslims work in their own localities to bring Muslims, Parsis and Christians do the \nsame thing. \n\"Here, I have been hearing for a long time about the two groups in the U.S., but there has \nbeen some misunderstanding. What is the difficulty?\" \n(John Bass was the head of the Monday night group, and Ivy Duce head of the Sufi group. \nJohn stood and said that at times the two groups had a tendency to unite, or to try and \nattract each other's members.) \nBaba: \"Ivy, are you happy? How do you feel? (she nodded.) Fine. Are you ready for a nice \nfight? How do you feel? (laughter) \n(John continued, saying he always emphasised that those who had met Baba in 1952 did not \nneed any 'ism,' but only to read and study Baba's own teachings.) \nIvy: Since Baba himself has designed and created a charter for Sufism Reoriented, it is silly \nto say no 'ism' is necessary. Baba wants this 'ism.' \nBaba: \"I want you all to bear in mind one thing. I now emphasise one point which I \nemphasised in India also, when I called all together at the Andhra meeting. I said that for me \nthere is no need for centers, for different places, nor different groups with different heads or \nnames. My center is the heart of every lover. Every lover with a heart that loves Baba is a \ncenter. \n\"The second point I would like to emphasize is that whoever wants to work spreading my \nmessage of love and truth absolutely needs a central office and groups of workers who can \nfunction from that central office. There is always a need for a group to have a center. You \ncan have many such centers. Myrtle Beach is such a center, and it stretches for many miles. \nBut there should be cooperation, harmony, and the group heads should not try to win over \nother members from one office to another. Why? What for, when all work for Baba. There \nshould be harmony, cooperation. \n\"Ivy once said to me that if I ordered it, she would just dissolve the Sufi order and have \nnothing to do with it, but I said no. On the contrary, I gave her a charter to hold meetings, \nhave an office, conduct affairs, which she does. I am the greatest Sufi of the past, present and \nfuture. I have ordered the Sufis to continue, and I have also instructed John Bass to hold his \ngroup meetings on Mondays, and told Dana Field that he can have his own group to bring \ntogether as many new lovers as possible. \n\"There should be no competition. Each one, especially the group heads, should be an \nexample to the others, be humble as dust. One must become like dust to work for God. The \nego should not be tickled about position and office and say, 'I am a group head.' Those that \nwork under certain group heads should not leave them. Under certain circumstances one \nmay change one's group, because all are doing my work. But that does not mean every \nworker should have his hand 'on both sides of the drum' as we say in India. It also does not \nmean that people of one group should not be on harmonious terms with the other group... in \nfact, there should always be loving cooperation for my work. \n\"Ivy loves me. She tells her Sufi group to love me. John Bass tells his group to love me. \nEverything comes to me. Everything is as if said to me. You should not gossip about each \nother. All should be friends. Ivy, you have written wonderful letters about John. \nJohn: Especially since the book 'God Speaks.' \n(laughter - John had sold a great many of the books, which Ivy and her group had published) \nIvy: That's unkind. Makes me sound like cupboard love. It's wrong to say that people should \nnot come to Baba through 'isms.' You are welcome to choose your own path with your \nleader. But you should not go back and forth. All should join in any joint Baba project. \nMeherji: What's wrong with attending a meeting now and then? \nBaba: They can go. But it usually creates some misunderstanding. In your body, everything \nbelongs to you... arms, hands, but however hard you try, you cannot strangle yourself with \nyour own hands. You cannot do it. Don, you explain. \nDon Stevens: Baba says, each of us has our own two hands. our own two arms. Have you \never felt your own hands would strangle you? They may try but they cannot. They could \nonly strangle another person. \nBaba: \"John Bass is my left hand, Ivy is my right hand, and all of you my throat. So how can \nthese two hands throttle me? Is it possible? Suppose there is a red ant. It's possible the right \nhand might slap the left hand in killing it... \n\"What about Elizabeth? To what group does she belong? Yet she may be loving me even \nmore than any group heads, or those working in certain groups. There may be greater \nlovers of Baba than the group heads; that is not to be judged. Yet, someone who does not \nbelong to any group may be the greatest lover of all. \n\"What I want is love, and to make others know about truth... what I say about truth and love \nfor humanity. So naturally you have groups and offices. Everything should be done in \nharmony. Each group should cooperate with each other. If someone belongs to the Sufis \ntoday, and wants to join John Bass' group, he can do so. But if he then tells John his group is \nhopeless, useless, and goes back to the Sufis and condemns John's group, the grace of my \nlove is set aside. I don't like backbiting, criticism, confusion, which creates \nmisunderstanding and confusion... \n\"If you want to change groups, do it, but do not keep going back and forth.\" \nSam Cohen: Suppose one feels that meditating by oneself is service. I like to visit the \nMonday group, but not all the time. \nBaba: I would like you all to belong to certain groups. Why? Because you can cooperate and \ntell others about me and share your thoughts. You learn much more than when you remain \nby yourself. When you listen, exchange thoughts, prayers, my presence is there. Where \nthere are five collected together, Parameshwar is there, I am there. If you are talking of me, \nhaving love for me, then there I am... Is it all clear? \n(Bili Eaton asked how they should conduct the meetings) \nBaba: \"Why be bound by my instructions? Be free.\" \n(Kitty Davy suggested that the groups should meet jointly once in awhile during the year. \nIvy said that they did meet together on Baba's birthday. Others said that that wasn't often \nenough. Then Baba referred to a meeting planned to take place in India.) \nBaba: \"In India, at the meeting, all points wil be cleared up to those who attend. I don't want \nto tell anything about this meeting. Nothing has ever happened like it before. Continue to \nwork as you are doing until that meeting. Everything will be cleared up then. I want you all \nto continue as you have been doing, on the lines I gave out this morning, until the next \nmeeting, when everything will be made clear to you. Until then, continue to work. \n\"If John Bass comes to know of some good news, it is his duty to tell the others. The other \ngroup heads should know about it, and vice versa. Then all can love me. I want to create the \nhead and heart in balance...\" \n29 July 1956, \nMyrtle Beach, \nAw 4:4 p30-32 \nAnother version: HM p263-265 \nBack to top \nPOONA, 1957 \nI love all. But I do not necessarily need the rich, the respectable and the intelligent for my \nwork. I need the simple common people, irrespective of their weaknesses. Simple-hearted \nfisherman gathered around Jesus. Krishna was happy in the company of light-hearted gopis, \nthe cowherd companions. Was not Pendya, a lame gopi, very dear to Krishna? I am happy in \nyour company, for it is only love that matters, and not the 'position.' \n... What do you understand when I say that your heart should become a Baba-center? In \nyour bhajans you sing of me as being the ancient one. I am the ancient one. But you have not \nfinished your part of the thing merely by singing about me. You have to live up to what you \nsay or sing. This is the true meaning of your being my center. You must be very careful in \nyour everyday life, about your thoughts, words and deeds. Negligence in this respect will be \ndishonoring me. \nBaba: (smiling) One good thing that is common to you all is that you love me, and the second \nis that you quarrel among yourselves. (Laughter) \nWorker: Baba, now there is an end to our quarrels. We work as a team. \n(Baba asked if anyone else had anything to say about this) \nSecond worker: To be frank, Baba, I wish to bring to your notice that there are still some \nhonest differences of opinion as regards the nature of the work that we are doing at the \ncenter. \nBaba: Yes, go on. \nSecond worker: Some of our group are of the opinion that you being the Avatar, you alone \ncan do the Avataric work. So they think that there is no need for them to work in the way it \nis being done through the center. \nBaba: But what do you personally think about this? \nSecond worker: I like to run the center and thus spread your name and message of love and \ntruth to the people. \nBaba: I am pleased with this frank discussion. Be what you are, and do what you feel best in \nmy love. If some of you believe in me as the Avatar, it is as it should be. But you should \nhonestly feel it with all your heart. \nNow, if you take me to be the Avatar, I pervade and become all beings, including you all. \nThen it naturally follows that those who believe me to be the ancient one must work, since I \nmyself work. For one who has the irrevocable conviction that I am the highest of the high, \nwork is no work. It all becomes sahaj.* \nWork means to love Baba wholeheartedly. You should get lost in it, so much so that you \nforget yourself completely. But such a love is a gift rarely received. If you do not have such \nlove, obey me implicitly. Carry out my orders, regardless of any comments from others. And \nyou know what pleases me. \nIf this also is not possible, try, try your very best to remember me, and thus love Baba. Run \nMeher centers, sing bhajans, and tell others about me and my message. And I repeat, be \nsincere and honest to act according to what you preach. \nI know that I am the highest of the high. So I say unto you, 'love me, love me.' This is the only \nthing that matters. The law says, 'live for others.' I, being the one without a second, pervade \nall, including the others. So it is quite in conformity with the law when I say 'love me.' \nYou are all blessed to have come in my personal contact, but make the most of it. Much can \nbe said, and will be left unsaid, about work. However, for the present, you must be very \nparticular up to 31st March 1958 about observing the following orders... mentioned in the \nrecent Life Circular**: \n1. Be determined to obey Baba. \n2. Abstain from lustful action. \n3. Be honest. Do not deceive or give false hopes to anyone. \n4. Don't hurt the feelings of others. \n8 December 1957, \nPoona, \nAw 19:2 p4, 32 \n*sahaj = natural, effortless \n**Life Circular 37 \n20 October 1957, LC p79-85 \nThe complete text of the orders was: \n\"Now, for six months, up to March 1958 \n1. Be ready and determined to do whatever I ask you to do. \n2. Do no lustful action whatsoever; even husband and wife had better remain celibate. \n3. Be honest. Honesty demands that you deceive no one, give no false hope or empty \npromise. \n4. Try your very best not to hurt the feelings of others, but not to the extent of doing any \nlustful action. \nThose who have not surrendered to me, or who cannot do so, but would nevertheless like to \nobey me, should consider the last three injunctions as my order to them.\" \n(LC p85) \nIn March, Baba extended the order to July 10, 1958, with this exception: \n\"However, I exempt married couples from the injuction of their remaining celibate.\" \n(LC p86) \nBack to top \nAHMEDNAGAR, 1962 \nI am happy to hear that my lovers at Nagar are inaugurating the Meher center at Khushru \nQuarters. Though it is true that my real center is in the heart of the individual, it is helpful \nfor my lovers to come together and think and talk about me, to discuss my teachings and \nmessages, compare notes with each other, and cooperatively try to come closer to me in \nunderstanding and spirit. The one who does not seek my blessings, and desires nothing \nfrom me but to be able to love and serve me, is my true lover. \nIn view of my long stay at Meherabad and Meherazad, the Nagar Meher center has a special \nresponsibility and a role to play. In the future, when Meherabad and Meherazad become \nplaces of pilgrimage for my lovers all over the world, the world will be rightly looking \nforward to the Nagar Meher center for receiving my love and truth. \nIt is therefore for you to have these from me by keeping yourself in inner contact with me, \nby bringing your lives into tune with my will, and by living in a manner that would inspire \nothers to follow you in loving me. \nMy nazar will be on everyone participating in the functions of the Nagar Meher center, \nwhich no doubt will have a bright future, rising up to the expectations which the world will \nnaturally build up. \nMay you all inherit my life eternal. \nMy love and blessing to you. \n1962, Ahmednagar \nfor the opening of the Ahmednagar Meher Baba center \n'The Early History of the Ahmednagar Center' by Ward Parks \nMeherana Messenger 1995: 2 p3 \nnazar = the glance of the Master. Nazar has also been translated as 'grace' and 'blessing.' \nBack to top \nPOONA, 1962 \nYour coming to me from different places, and from across oceans, has pleased me. And \nalthough no sacrifice to be near me is too great, I am touched by the sacrifice that some of \nyou have made to come here. \nThose who have not been able to come to me should not feel disheartened, for my love is \nwith them, as always, and specially so at this time. I know how they are longing to be near \nme, even for an hour, and how helpless they are in their circumstances. \nYou have come from great distances, not for some convention or conference, but to enjoy \nmy company, and feel afresh my love in your hearts. It is a coming together of the children \nof East and West in the house of their father. \nAll religions of the world proclaim that there is but one God, the father of all in creation. I \nam that father. I have come to remind all people that they should live on Earth as the \nchildren of the one father, until my grace awakens them to the realisation that they are all \none without a second, and that all divisions and conflicts and hatreds are but a shadow-play \nof their own ignorance. \nAlthough all are my children, they ignore the simplicity and beauty of this truth by indulging \nin hatreds, conflicts and wars that divide them in enmity, instead of living as one family in \ntheir father's house. Even amongst you who love me and accept me for what I am, there is \nsometimes lack of understanding of one another's hearts. \nPatiently I have suffered these things in silence for all my children. It is now time that they \nbecome aware of the presence of their father in their midst, and of their responsibility \ntowards him and themselves. \nI shall break my silence, and with my word of words, arouse my children to realise in their \nlives the indivisible existence which is God. \nThroughout the years I have been giving many messages and discourses. Today I simply \nwant to tell you, who are gathered here in my love, to shut the ears of your minds, and open \nthe ears of your hearts, and hear my word when I utter it. \nDo not seek my blessing, which is always with you, but long for the day when my grace will \ndescend on all who love me. Most blessed are they who do not even long for my grace, but \nsimply seek to do my will. \n'My Dear Children,' \nNovember 1962, Poona \nto a gathering of his followers, \nPS p134-135 \nfrom a booklet 'The 1962 East-West Gathering' \nIn spite of telling you very often that I will not give you any more messages or discourses, I \nfind myself doing just this thing, which is what I do not want to do. This is because most of \nyou do things which I do not like you doing. \nI had to give you a message yesterday because you expected one; and the theme of the \nmessage was on your being my children, because despite much talk about a Baba-family, \nthere is more a semblance than a reality of kinship among you, who are the children of one \nfather. \nTrue children of one father do not greet one another with smiles and embraces, and at the \nsame time harbor grudges and ill-feelings; but they have an active concern in their hearts \nfor the well-being of one another, and make sacrifices for that well-being. \nIf you make me your real father, all differences and contentions between you, and all \npersonal problems in connection with your lives, will become dissolved in the ocean of my \nlove. \nYou are all keen on spreading my message of love and truth, and many of you in the East \nand West have laboured hard in this work; publishing magazines and other literature, \norganising meetings, sacrificing your vacations in traveling, building halls, and having \nstatues made of me. But I wonder how much of my love and truth has been in your work of \nspreading my message of love and truth! \nUnless there is brotherly feelings in your hearts, all the words that you speak or print in my \nname are hollow; all the miles that you travel in my cause are zero; all organisations for my \nwork are but an appearance of activity; all buildings that contain me are empty places; and \nall statues that you make to embody me are of someone else. \nI have been patient and indulgent over the way you have been doing these things, because \nyou have been very young children in my love, and children must have some sort of games \nto play. But now you are older, and are beginning to realise that there is a greater work \nahead of you than what you have been doing. And you have been searching your minds and \nhearts as to what this work might be. \nIt is not a different work to what you have been already doing - it is the same work, done in \na different way. And that way is the way of effacement, which means the more you work for \nme, the less important you feel in yourself. \nYou must always remember that I alone do my work. Although only the one who has \nbecome one with God can serve and work for all, I allow you to work for me so that you \nhave the opportunity to use your talents and capacities selflessly, and to draw closer to me. \nYou should never think that, in your work for me, you are benefiting others; for by being \ninstrumental in bringing others to me, you are benefiting yourself. \nMy work is your opportunity. But when you allow yourself to intervene between you and \nmy work, you are allowing the work to take you away from me. When you put my work \nbefore yourself, the work will go right, although not necessarily smoothly. And when the \nwork does not go right, it means you have put yourself between it and its accomplishment. \nThe way of my work is the way of effacement, which is the way of strength, not of weakness, \nand through it you become mature in my love. At this stage you cannot know what real love \nis, but through working for me as you should work for me, you will arrive at that ripeness \nwhere, in a moment, I can give you that for which you have been millions of years seeking. \n'My Dear Workers,' \nNovember 1962, Poona \nto a gathering of his followers, \nPS p135-136 \nfrom a booklet 'The 1962 East-West Gathering' \n\"Baba wants his lovers to spread far and wide his message of love and truth, in the spirit of \nhis message 'My Dear Children' and 'My Dear Workers' given by him during the East-West \ngathering at Poona in November 1962.\" \nDecember 1962, \nPS p136, also FL p149 \nDo whatever needs to be done, but do it as a spiritual being; as one who knows he is divine \nby nature and united with the whole of life in essence. \nDo it as if you are doing it for me or for God. Do it with equal consideration for the interests \nof all concerned, for God is equally in each. Do it with utmost concentration, yet with utter \ndetachment from the results of action. Leave the fruit of action to me or to God. \nDo it as if it were the most important thing in the universe, yet let it be destroyed, or \nignored, or ridiculed, without concern, or let it be praised without elation. Leave the \nresponse to me or to God. \nDo it, in short, as if you were not doing it at all, but as if I or God were doing it through you. \ndate and place unknown, \nPS p208 \nfrom 'The Unstruck Music of \nMeher Baba,' ed.

Email mehersthan at gmail.com \n  \nBook Two \nAffirmations \nAffirmations \nWORKING FOR MEHER BABA \nBook Two \n\"I witnessed a man who came before Baba in  Myrtle Beach in 1952. Ivy Duce brought this \nman. He was giving a lot of talks on spirituality. He was very respected all over Europe, a \nvery important man. \n\"I was the interpreter, and was dumbfounded when Baba asked him the following question. \nI thought he would ask him a question about his work, about his understanding of the \nAvatar, or something else, but Baba asked him directly, 'Are you involved with a woman?' \n\"He was a very truthful and honest man. He said, 'Yes, Baba, I am.' \n\"Then Baba said, 'Then what is the good of your talking about spirituality? Will you do one \nthing?' \n\"He replied, 'Yes, I shall try. I don't promise.' \n\"'All right,' Baba said. 'Give up this business of bangles.' (Bangles signified woman or women \nin Baba's gestures.) \n\"'I will try,' the man said. \n\"That was in 1952. Baba went again in 1956. This man came also and saw him again. Baba \nagain asked him about this, and he replied, 'I am still very much in the world.' \n\"Baba said, 'What is the good of your giving talks? Give up this hypocrisy.'\" \nAdi K. Irani, JT p137 \nKings Road, Ahmednagar \nJuly 10, 1968 \n(Adi told this story during a public talk, so Baba's words are not exact, but as Adi \nremembered them.) \nDear brothers and sisters of Meher-parivar, \nI am extremely pained to find that there is a rift in the Meher-parivar in _________. This fact \nhas been brought to beloved Baba's notice with utmost reluctance, and Baba wants me to let \nall his dear lovers know that: \n1. Whatever be the cause of the rift, he wants each one to try his best to narrow it down and \nmend it by forgiving and forgetting one another's trespasses. This is possible if one resolves \nto be very sincere, very humble and very loving. Hypocrisy, arrogance and hatred widen the \nrift and breed contempt. \n2. This is a very critical period of the Avataric age, and all his lovers must strive their utmost \nto hold his daaman very firmly so that it does not slip out of their hands under any \ncircumstance. \n3. It is very important for all his lovers, especially in this critical period, not to succumb to \nlust. Temptations are and will be great, but your love for him should be greater. Remember \nhim wholeheartedly, and rise swiftly from where you have fallen, to march ahead in his love \nand service as his determined soldiers heading towards victory. \n4. It is equally important at this critical period of the Avataric age to beware at all times of \npersons who lead others into believing that they are saintly and pious, and profess to \npossess supernatural powers. However pious such persons may appear to be, a Baba lover \nmust never mix up such piety with the divinity of the Avatar. \n5. A true Baba lover must remember the repeated warnings given to all Baba lovers time \nand again, to stay away from persons who feel and assert that they are masters and saints, \nand possess powers to help human beings. His lovers and workers should never get \ninvolved with such persons and affairs, much less with perverted 'helpers of humanity' who \nhave no reverence or regard for the Perfect Masters and the Avatar of the age. Beware of \nthem who exploit spirituality to gain their selfish ends, and dupe others in the name of \nSadgurus and the Avatar. \n6. His lovers and workers should not get intimately involved with the family affairs of one \nanother, and they should not be emotionally upset by the personal affairs concerning any of \nthe families. They should NOT let any personal affairs vitiate their relationships with one \nanother, or affect their efforts in the work they do for the cause of the Truth. \n7. He wants his lovers and workers who are spreading his message of love to others to share \nhis love among themselves, and to uphold the spirit of harmony and understanding in his \nname. He wants them to be less aggressive towards others and less tolerant towards \nthemselves, and above all, he wants them to love him wholeheartedly, for he is the Ancient \none who loves them more than they can ever love themselves. \nPlease note the above seven points carefully, as they are from beloved Baba. They are for all \nhis lovers and workers everywhere. \nWith loving regards, \nYours brotherly, \nAdi K.

    "text": "AFFIRMATIONS \nBook Two \n\"On one occasion the Master emphasized to the boys, \n' Remember you are not the body. You are soul, spirit. Try to stop thinking you are the body. \nTry to stop thinking you are energy. Try to stop thinking you are mind. Think, \nI am soul. \nI am spirit. ' \nAnd the boys actually did try. One boy was found shouting to his body that it was not real.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM3 p977 \n(November 1927? Meherabad) \nA man came to meet Baba. He said he was addicted to drugs. \nBaba: Are you happy? \nMan: No, very, very miserable. \nBaba: Try to be always happy. Never think that life is dreadful, 'I am tired of life.' Such \nthoughts really make life miserable. Life is worth living. If you think like that, all difficulties \nwill appear insignificant. \nI will help you to try to develop love. Never think, 'I am alone,' 'I have so much to do,' 'I am \npoor,' and so on. All are poor. The whole world is poor. Even the millionaires are poor, \nbecause they have greed and want more. Love someone, and I will help you.* Do not worry. \nMy blessings. \n1930s, Europe? A p2 \nAnother version: PM p249 \n* Another version of this line: \n\"Love someone, and you will be rich.\" PM p249 \nQ. I have come to ask to develop the divine within. I feel I cannot achieve it alone, without \nhelp. \nBaba: You will... by my help. Never be disheartened. It is all within, and I will help you to \nopen it. I am so happy to see you longing for spiritual attainment. \nQ. I do not know anything but this, and I ask for nothing else. \nBaba: I am so happy to know this. \nQ. How can spirituality be attained? \nBaba: It can be attained, not by the intellect, but by heart and feeling and inner experience. I \nwould explain for hours, but that would be nothing compared to one second of my internal \nhelp. Do one thing: every night, just before retiring, think for one minute, \nThe infinite God is within me, and I am part of the infinite. \nThis will contact you more and more with me internally. \n1930s, Europe, A p6 \nAnother version: PM p243 \nAn architect came to see Baba. \nBaba: Anything to ask? \nQ. I cannot ask anything. I am so perplexed. \nBaba: And it is a pity I have not much time, because when one comes, I must explain. But for \nthat I must have time. Anyway, you can ask. I would like to make you sit here and think of \nquestions. \nQ. But it makes it so awkward for you. \nBaba: Never mind, go on. \nQ. I am very anxious to find something real that we have to think of and do. \nBaba: And that something is the only thing worth having. I will help you spiritually. \nQ. Can I have that? \nBaba: Yes, I know. You can. It is not through words or explanations that it can be explained. \nIt is within you. It is to be opened. I will do it. \nQ. In New York I saw some of your people, who made me think and feel I must have \nsomething else to seek, and for that, I do try to see that reality. \nBaba: And when you find it, you can experience (higher) things even while being in your \nworldly affairs. Every morning, just the moment you get up, think for a minute, \nIt is in me. \nAnd rest assured that I will help you. I can help you. \nQ. I understand very well. I realise and believe it. I thank you very much for all that you have \ngiven me already, and am sure I will be helped. \n1930s, Europe? A p7 \nAnother version: PM p247 \nA woman psychology student came to meet Baba. \nQ. I don't dream or think of Jesus. \nBaba: Why bother about the physical Christ (if you can't get that idea as clearly as you \nwant)? If you can't picture him, you can feel the Christ within. That means the ideal, or pure \nlove. \nQ. I have read the Sermon on the Mount, but can't have a clear conception of Jesus. \nBaba: I will help you. Do one thing. Immediately when you get up every morning, just let \nyourself have this thought, \nChrist is within me \nand leave the rest to me. I will help you spiritually. \n1934, Zurich, Switzerland, A p8 \nAlso PM p239 \nA woman nurse came to see Baba. She told him some of her fears. \nQ. Oh, I am so happy to see you... I am so tired of life, and very unhappy... don't see how I can \nimprove. \nBaba: Everyone is unconsciously tired of this life, because everyone seeks happiness, but \nknows not how to get it. But life is so beautiful. It is meant to be happy. \nI will help you. Then things will appear changed. You will see it. \nIt is always the outlook that counts, and not the object. Today you feel tired, upset, seeing \nnothing beautiful in things round you in life. If tomorrow you do not feel bored but cheerful, \nin the same things that appeared so black to you yesterday... it is all due to changed \nmentality and outlook. \nThe easy way is not to make much of things. Take them lightly. Say to yourself, \nI am meant to be happy, to make others happy. \nAnd gradually you do become happy yourself, and make others too. Don't suggest to your \nmind, 'I am tired, haggard, depressed.' That will make you feel worse. Always say, \nAll is well and beautiful. I will be happy. \nI will help you spiritually. I can and I will. You will feel it. \n1930s, Europe? A p13 \nAnother version: PM p241 \nA woman came to see Baba with her son, an actor. \nQ. Very glad to have met you. \nBaba: Anything to ask? \nQ. How can one achieve one's ambition? (she pointed to her son) He is an artist. \nBaba: And art is one of the sources through which the soul expresses itself and inspires \nothers. But to express art thoroughly, one must have the inner emotions opened thoroughly. \nIf you feel something checks you from expressing yourself thoroughly, then you have to do \none thing. That is to adjust your mental attitude thus: just before expressing, think, \nI can and will express it thoroughly. \nAnd every time you express it, you will find you are more convinced of your expression. It is \nthe mind that keeps it closed. \nThere are many actors who, either through inferiority complex, or through nervousness or \nthrough dryness, feel they cannot express, and this feeling of the mind checks the \nexpression. While acting, think you are one of the greatest actors of the world, and try to \nexpress yourself thoroughly. \nI will help you spiritually. Just think you are the greatest. Where's the harm in thinking like \nthat? It is not for pride you do it, but for bringing the best out of you. There is nothing \nwrong. \nQ. What binds me to the Almighty? \nBaba: Divine love. \nQ. But I do not feel I have it. \nBaba: That is because you are unconscious of it. You will feel it now, and I will help you. \n1930s, Europe, \nA p15-16 and PM p253-254 \nMeher Baba told Chakradhar and Indumati Deshmukh, \n'Don't meditate, but have this longing: \nI want to be one with Baba's infinite existence. \n9 April 1938, Panchgani, LM7 p2279 \nThree separate affirmations mentioned by Meher Baba: \nI am infinite. \nI am not my desires. \nI am not my body, but the infinite. \nMeher Baba, 1940s, Di (7th ed.) p208, 210s \nFor an explanation of the use of this kind of affirmation, which Baba called 'associative \nmeditation' and 'dissociative meditation,' see the Discourses, 7th edition, p207-212. \nFive more separate affirmations mentioned by Meher Baba: \nI am as infinite as the sky within. \nI am as infinite as the ocean within. \nI am as infinite as the emptiness within. \nI am the infinite within. \nI am infinite. \nFor an explanation of the use of this kind of affirmation, which Baba called 'impersonal \nmeditation'  see the Discourses, 7th edition, p234-239. \nThis affirmation, given by Meher Baba, is known as the Mandali's prayer. \nI am not the body. \nI am not the mind. \nI am not this. \nI am not that. \nI am nothing but a living lie \nof that truth that is me \nand unless the lie is dead \nthe truth cannot be. \nQ. What about the Mandali's prayer? Was it given by Baba? \nEruch Jessawala: Yes. He gave it. But we didn't recite this out loud in his presence. It was \ngiven to the Mandali as their personal prayer. \n1980, Meherazad, Aw 19:2 p8-9 \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

A great war will break out and rage between the Western countries - Russia, America, \nEngland, Italy,  Germany and others. There will be such chaos and confusion throughout the \nworld that not one leader will understand what to do. And out of this confusion and chaos, \nthe Avatar will appear, to guide misguided humanity onto the path of peace and prosperity - \ntoward eternal bliss. \n\"But that will take time and require great upheavals throughout the world. These disorders, \ndisturbances and unrest are necessary to make the world turn its face toward spirituality, \nand ensure its future salvation.\" \nMeher Baba, 28 May 1930, \nMeherabad, LM4 p1314-1315 \n\"A person has to pass through three stages before Realisation: evolution, reincarnation, and \nadvancement on the Path. From stone to animal to human form is evolution. This is the first \nstage. With the human form, evolution ends, and the cycle of rebirth begins. This is the \nsecond stage. The third stage is involution through the spiritual planes. \n\"In Africa there is a full swing of evolution, as all types of animals, plants and metals are \nfound there. In Europe and  America, reincarnation is intensified, with numerous people \ntaking birth entangled together. In Asia there is spiritual progress and advancement on the \nPath. That is why saints and Masters are found in the East, particularly  India.\" \nMeher Baba, 6 March 1930, \nMysore, LM4 p1276 \n\"From ancient times, India has been a land of spirituality. So being born in India is a matter \nof spiritual pride, in as much as a person is seemingly so near the spiritual goal. \n\"The best of people born in America, Europe, Africa and other countries, with their good \nkarma from this life, are born in India in their next life. \n\"And the worst of those born in India with false pride, egoism and undesirable karmas are \nborn in Europe and America, or in places which are so spiritually backward.\" \nMeher Baba, 28? May 1930, \nAhmednagar, LM4 p1314 \n\"Spiritual centers are to be opened, especially in America, Turkey, Russia, Persia and \nEngland, and the Devonshire retreat will be such a center.\" \nMeher Baba, 12 September 1931, \nLondon, (to Meredith Starr) LM4 p1410 \n1931 \nMeher Baba first came to  America November 6, 1931. He had sailed from Genoa, Italy on \nOctober 27th on the S. S. Roma, arriving in  New York harbor at 2 p.m. November 6th. \n\"I will come back to America to pour out my love to you, and to spiritualise America.\" \nMeher Baba, December 1931, \non the ship S. S. Narkunda en route \nto India from Marseilles, \nto Malcolm and Jean Schloss \nMahatma Gandhi: What do you think about the West from your experiences and tours? \nBaba: In America the spiritual hunger is intense. That is why I went and stayed there for a \nmonth. There is everything there materially. There is wealth, there are brains, there is heart. \nIn other words, there is sufficient preparedness for spiritual growth and development.   ... \nGandhi: Then there is an awakening and interest about spirituality in America? \nBaba: Yes, there is much. But the Americans have not had sufficient light and genuine \nguidance by a Master in a spiritual direction. If they get these, they will respond \nwonderfully. \nGandhi: And what about England? \nBaba: In England, there is also an interest and longing, but not as intense as in America. The \nresponse that Americans gave was so splendid that even now I am considering when to go \nthere again. They would not let me leave, and have made me promise that I return soon; \nonly then did they let me leave... \n3 January 1932, Bombay? \nLM4 p1515-1517 \n\"I want to make the Americans realise the infinite state which I myself enjoy.\" \nMeher Baba, 20 March 1932, Nasik, \nto Mills, an Associated Press correspondent, \nLM5 p1541 \nBaba returned to America twice in the 1930s \n1932 \nExcerpts from an interview with Frederick Collins: \n\"Sex for me,\" he said, \"does not exist.\" \nOf course, he did not say it; but he communicated it to me by a method I'll explain in a \nminute. \n\"Modern marriage is too much of a business affair,\" he continued. \"No wonder it so often \nresults in divorce. Husband and wife should put each other first. It is essential for a happy \nfamily life that selfless love should predominate over lust.\" \nI ventured to suggest that we who live in America had a good many problems right now \nbesides sex problems. Baba smiled sympathetically, humorously. His smile was like an open \nfire in a cold house. \n\"Things have been messed up a good deal here,\" he said, \"by lack of understanding.\" \nThe fact that this Parsee messiah was discussing our American problems in American \nlanguage as naturally as if he had lived here all his life didn't seem so strange as you might \nthink. \nAnd the fact that he was discussing them, not with his perfectly good voice, but by means of \nletters which he pointed to on a small blackboard which he held on his lap, did not seem \nstrange either. \nSeven year silences, it seems, are not uncommon events among the holy men of India. The \nuncommon thing about Baba's was that he made you forget it so soon and so completely. He \ncould 'talk' in seven different languages on his little board, and could spell out his words in \nany of the seven faster than human eye could follow. He was articulate in many other ways, \nthis odd little man who came out of the East to save the world. He talked with his eyes, \nwhich I must say are the largest and softest and shiningest and smilingest I ever saw; and \nwith jolly little grunts; and with affectionate pats of approval and agreement. Then there \nwas his smile. \n\"What are you going to do,\" I asked, \"for this 'messed-up' country of ours?\" \n\"It is my country too,\" he said simply. \nApparently he feels that way about every country... \nHis special reason for visiting us for the purpose of breaking his seven year silence was, he \nsaid, that America, being most deeply engrossed in material things, and suffering most in \nconsequence, was the soil in which a new spiritual rebirth would first take place. \n\"When you break your silence,\" I asked, \"how will you do it? By radio?\" \n\"Surely not by radio!\" exclaimed one of his London disciples in his most horrified British \nmanner. \n\"Why not?\" spelled out Baba on his board. \nSkeptic that I was, I could not doubt his sincerity. Or his courage. When I asked him to \nparticularize about the kinds of messing up to which we in America had been subjected, he \nmight easily have sought refuge behind one of the general, vague assertions of principle \nwith which all Eastern writings are filled. \n\"America has great energy,\" he said, \"but a great deal of it is misdirected; and misdirected \nenergy produces destructive complexes, and these in turn produce fear, greed, lust and \nanger, which result in moral and spiritual decay.\" \n\"Those are strong words,\" I protested. \nHe smiled reassuringly. He certainly could do wonders with that smile. \n\"Is it your aim to help us with our spiritual problems or our practical problems?\" I asked. \n\"Our spiritual problems are our practical ones.\" \n\"And just how do you intend to help?\" \n\"The help I will give will produce a change of heart in thousands, and then right thinking \nand living will result automatically.\" \n\"Will that solve the depression problem?\" \n\"It will solve every problem.\" \n\"Prohibition?\" \n\"Yes - and the problem behind prohibition,\" he said. \"I do not believe in drink, and none of \nmy followers drink. But I know that prohibition should never have been put in effect the \nway it was.\" \n\"All at once?\" \n\"Yes. Spirits should have been barred, but not beer and wine. Then we might have had a law \nthat could be enforced. As it is, we have a law which makes money for dishonest officials \nand increases all vices everywhere.\" \nYou may not agree with this opinion. But at least it is an opinion. I had to admit that, for all \nhis seven year silence, Meher Baba had said more in these few spelled-out sentences than \nmany a senator or party platform maker had mouthed in seven hour speeches. \n\"I believe in self-control,\" he continued, \"not in coercion. Coercion is based on oppression, \nand results in fear and hatred. Self-control requires courage, and may be induced by love. \nWe will do many things for those whom we love which we would not ordinarily do - which \nwe would not ordinarily have the strength of mind and power to do. How many habits have \nwe been able to break through love, which we would never have had the strength to break \nwithout love? And when the love is universal love, all habits which are detrimental, either to \nthe individual or to the social order, will be dissolved in its light. \n\"It is the same way with this economic situation you were asking me about,\" he added. \n\"There is a very close connection between a man's character and his circumstances, \nbetween his internal environment of thoughts and desires and his external environment. 'As \nwithin, so without' is the law. \n\"If we are dissatisfied with our environment, it is usually because we do not know how to \nadjust ourselves properly to the environment. Instead of thinking, 'How can I get out of \nthis?' and becoming discouraged or depressed, we should think, 'What is the lesson I should \nlearn from this experience?' \n\"Poverty, if cheerfully endured, provided one does one's best to find work, develops \nhumility and patience, and can greatly assist spiritual progress. It is a test of character. I \nknow it is difficult to be cheerful while starving, but all the worthwhile things are difficult. \n\"Even millionaires are unhappy unless they have learned to think and live rightly.\" \nI asked him if he thought a general acceptance of his doctrine of love would bring about a \nmore equable distribution of what you and I need every day - money. \n\"It must,\" he replied. \"Suppose we all loved each other as deeply as we now love the one \nwhom we love best. The most natural desire of love is to share what one has with the \nbeloved. The desire to share with everyone would produce a condition under which it \nwould be a disgrace rather than an honor for anyone to possess more than anyone else.\" \nSex. Prohibition. Poverty. All were to be banished by love. \n\"Do you expect to do this all at once?\" I asked. \n\"No. But sooner than you think. People will respond.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"They will have to.\" \nHe didn't explain. But he didn't need to: I knew he would say that the compelling force \nwould be love... \n18 May 1932, New York \npart of an article by Frederick L. Collins, published in Liberty Magazine, \nJuly? 1932, p26-27 \nFor the complete article, see 'Meeting Meher Baba' in this book. \nPart of this article is reproduced in LM5 p1620-1622 \nRom Landau: Do you think a possible spiritual revival (happiness) will be the outcome of \nindividual effort, or rather a collective movement of nations (like the great religious \nmovements of the past)? Will certain nations achieve it sooner than others, and which? \nBaba: The spiritual revival that you ask about is not very far off, and I am going to bring it \nabout in the near future, utilising the tremendous amount of misapplied energy possessed \nby America for the purpose. Such a spiritual outburst that I visualise takes place every seven \nor eight hundred years, at the end or beginning of a cycle, and it is only the Perfect One who \nhas reached the Christ state of consciousness that can appeal and work so very universally. \nAnswered by mail, May 1932, \nLondon, A p38. \nAnother version: LM5 p1612 \nThe following quote seems to be based on the one above: \n\"I intend bringing about a great spiritual revival in the near future, utilising the tremendous \namount of energy possessed by America for the purpose. Such a spiritual outpouring that I \nvisualise usually takes place at the beginning or end of a cycle, and only a Perfect one who \nhas reached the Christ state of consciousness can make such a universal appeal... \n\"The benefits that shall accrue to different nations and countries when I bring about the \nspiritual upheaval, will be largely determined by the amount of energy each one possesses. \nThe greater the energy, however misapplied, the greater the response. The Master merely \ndiverts the current into the right channel. \nMeher Baba, 19 May 1932, New York, \npart of a printed message given to reporters who came on board the ship Bremen, Me p84-\n87 \nOther versions: PM p165-168, LM5 p1616-1618 \n\"I am so very pleased to see you again. Among you are many of the first Americans I met last \ntime I was here - so I regard you as old friends. \n\"No doubt some of you have seen various newspaper reports about myself and my work. \nMany of these are misleading. But it is not to be wondered at if journalists do not \nunderstand my work or pander to the desire for sensation. \n\"I do not intend to found any religion, cult, creed or society. There are already far too many \nof these organisations. I have come to help people realise their ideals in daily life. The \nwidespread dissatisfaction in modern life is due to the gulf between theory and practise, \nand between the ideal and its realisation on Earth. The spiritual and material aspects of life \nare widely separated, instead of being closely united. \n\"There is no fundamental opposition between spirit and matter,  or if you like, between life \nand form. The apparent opposition is due to wrong thinking, to ignorance. Hence the \nremedy lies in the continuous practise of right thinking, to permanent Illumination resulting \nfrom the balance between the head and the heart. This is the Illumination which I intend to \ngive. \n\"The greatest mystics have realised through personal experience that God alone is real, and \neverything is God. This means that, though you may not be aware of it, the highest is latent \nin each  one of you. But in order for it to be lived and experienced in consciousness, it must \nbe manifested. \n\"Intellectual conviction of this truth is not enough. True knowledge consists in Illumination \nwhich finally culminates in union with the ultimate reality. This last is the state of Christ \nconsciousness, which is my permanent condition. \n\"The obstacles to Illumination are certain mental tendencies and desires connected with \negoism, which in the East are called sanskaras. The sum total of these tendencies and \ndesires creates the illusion of a separate self at war with or isolated from other selves. \nEvolution, or the fall into matter, made the creation of such a separate self necessary. \nOtherwise, spiritual consciousness could never be attained in the flesh. \n\"In the beginning, before evolution began, we were united with the source of all, and (have) \na consequent conscious longing to return to it through a succession of lives and forms. The \nconscious return to the source during physical incarnation only became possible when \nconsciousness became equilibrated in Gross matter. \n\"America represents the vanguard and synthesis of the white races, and hence forms the \nbest foundation for the spiritual upheaval I will bring about in the near future. America has \ntremendous energy, but most of this energy is misdirected. I intend to divert it into spiritual \nand creative channels. \n\"I am now going to California for a few days. From there I must go to the Far East for one \nday for spiritual reasons. But I will be back in California by the end of June, and then I will \nspeak on June 29th. But if I should be delayed, I will return on July 12th and speak on July \n13th. \n\"When I speak, there will be many proofs of my spiritual  power, and of my ability to bestow \nIllumination. People will then realise that Truth, which is the source of all love and \nexistence, rules supreme in all departments of life. \n\"My work and aims are intensely practical. It is not practical to over-emphasise the material \nat the cost of the spiritual. It is not practical to have spiritual ideals without putting them \ninto practice. But to realise the ideal in daily life, to give a beautiful and adequate form to \nthe living spirit, to make brotherhood a fact - not merely a theory as at present - this is being \npractical in the truest sense of the word. \n\"My work will arouse great enthusiasm and a certain amount of opposition. That is \ninevitable. But spiritual work is strengthened by opposition, and so it will be with mine. It is \nlike shooting an arrow from a bow. The more you pull the bow-string towards you, the \nswifter the arrow speeds to its goal.\" \nMeher Baba, 22 May 1932, \npart of a message read out by Meredith Starr at a reception at \n88 Grove Street, New York, Me p88-90 \nOther versions: PM p169-171, LM5 p1626-1627 \nQ. What do you hope to accomplish in the  United States? \nBaba: A general spiritual awakening which will affect the whole of mankind, and will \neliminate depression and dissatisfaction existing in the world today. \n30 May 1932, Los Angeles, \ninterview with a reporter, LM5 p1648 \nMeher Baba sent this message to his followers in America when he cancelled his \nengagement to speak at the Hollywood Bowl: \n\"The whole world will know and recognise me as Jesus returned once I speak.\" \nJune or July 1932, \nHawaii? LM5 p1670 \n\"...  America, being the most deeply engrossed in material things, and suffering the most in \nconsequence, is the soil on which a new spiritual rebirth will first take place. \n\"America requires only the guiding hand of a Master to redirect its material powers to the \nheights of spirituality.\" \nMeher Baba, 26 January 1933, \nBandarawela, Ceylon \nto a reporter for the Ceylon Observer, LM5 p1757 \nBaba visits the Direct Agent for America \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, 17 December 1934 \n\"The train to California makes one stop of one-half hour at  Albuquerque, New Mexico. Baba \ngot off the train and walked up and down the long brick platform. I was with him. He wrote \nsomething on the palm of his hand - 'Indian.' \n\"I thought, what shall I do? Baba wants to see some Indians, and where shall I find any? I \npointed to an old squaw sitting in front of one of the shops that border the station. Baba \nmotioned to his four Indian disciples, pulled my arm through his, and off we went toward \nthe end of the long station platform. He turned abruptly and continued up a street as if he \nknew exactly where he was going. \n\"At that time I had not arrived at the state of mind which leaves everything to Baba. I was \nstill thinking of myself, and I thought, my, we have only half an hour here, and where is Baba \ngoing, hunting for Indians, we may miss the train... \n\"Baba, of course, knew what I was thinking. After walking about two blocks, I saw two \nIndians standing at the corner. One was very tall and fat, dressed in shirt and trousers and a \nband of red tied around his forehead. The other one was short and was selling small bows \nand arrows. I was delighted and I said to Baba, 'Here are two Indians.' \n\"The small Indian walked away, and Baba stood before the tall one, and they looked at each \nother. I murmured something about wondering whether he spoke English, but no one paid \nany attention to me. The Indian disciples said nothing, and in the back of my head I was \nthinking about the train. Suddenly Baba turned abruptly, again put my arm through his, and \nwe returned to the train just in time. The whole thing was so strange that I asked Baba if he \nknew that the Indian would be there, and Baba nodded yes - and on his board he said, 'One \nof my Agents.' \" \nRuano Bogislav, \nAw 3:3 p3-4, also HM p729 \n\"Baba has explained that this is one of the very rare direct Agents; he is the direct Agent for \nAmerica. In 1934, when Baba and a few of his disciples were on their way to California, the \ntrain stopped at Albuquerque for a short time. Baba spelt out the word 'Indian' on the palm \nof his hand, and went with Ruano away from the station into a small street nearby. At a \nstreet corner they noticed two American Indians; one was selling bows and arrows, and he \nwalked away as soon as Baba approached. The other, a tall, impressive figure with a red \nband tied round his head, stayed where he was, and for a few moments Baba and he stood \nfacing one another, each looking intently into the other's eyes. Baba then abruptly walked \nback to the station.\" \nWilliam Donkin, \nWa p373 \n\"Once on the train, Ruano narrated the incident to the others, and Baba commented about \nthe Indian, 'He is one of my Agents. He is the direct Agent in charge of America.' Baba later \nexplained that he was an Agent of the fourth plane - one of four in the world with \nmiraculous powers.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, \nLM6 p1934 \n(Direct Agents get their instructions directly from the Avatar. If necessary, they can perform \nmiracles for the Avatar, as he rarely performs them himself. W p373) \nDarwin Shaw wrote Baba in 1935 about starting a retreat for him in the  United States. Baba \nreplied, \n\"Whether that retreat on earth is established or not, I do really appreciate the spirit of love \nand brotherhood that has been awakened, and consider it as a spiritual retreat already \nestablished within, which is much more substantial and real than any earthly home or \nstructure. \n\"The true spirit is there, already awakened, and if it is fostered and kept up with warm \nfeelings of love and brotherhood, it will eventually bear results that will be helpful in the \ndevelopment of spiritual understanding of life and things pertaining to life. And wherever \nsuch spirit of love and brotherhood exists, inner light and guidance invariably follow.\" \n14 August 1935, Meherabad, LM6 p1969 \n\"Don't you know me after so many years of contact? One who does not care for the world, \nand publicly declares in  America, 'I will come here and speak,' and does not - don't you \nunderstand him yet? \n\"I do not care what the world will think or say. I will do anything for the sake of my work. \nEven if the whole world goes against me, I will do what I have to do.  But all in its time. I will \nteach and strike, both. \nMeher Baba, December 1939, \nBangalore, LM7 p2484-2485 \n\"America will play a very great part in the battle of humanity in the future.\" \nMeher Baba, 15 March 1941, \nQuetta, LM7 p2682 \n1952 \nMeher Baba visited the  United States from April 20th to July 31st, 1952. He was \naccompanied by Mehera, Mani Meheru, Goher, Rano and Kitty. \nBaba and the women landed at Idlewild Airport in New York City at 6.35 am.

In the form \nof Jesus crucified, or another. God will do it. He can do it. And now the time is near, very \nnear, when this spiritual upliftment has to take place. Yes, absolutely. It has to be, and will \nbe. \nToni: So that the terrible catastrophe which is over-hanging the world can be avoided? \nBaba: It is reaching its climax. Then there will be a change. \nToni: Will the climax be war, or can war be avoided? \nBaba: I know about it all. But be sure of one thing: America is destined to lead the world \nspiritually. \nToni: Those who love God will be the prey... \nBaba: Truth never fails, and lovers of God will soon triumph. I am happy. I see that you are a \ngenuine lover of God. \nToni: In this country, unfortunately, the youth are not taught about spirituality. A youth \ndoes not even get ethical education. \nBaba: Yes. But be sure these very youths, who now know not of God, but know only to eat, \ndrink, be merry and do lustful actions, will soon get the shock of their lives, and know that \nonly loving God is real life. \n16 May 1952, Myrtle Beach, \nSouth Carolina, LM11 p3823 \nAnother version of the same interview: \nAmerica now leads the material side of the world, and yet has such potential that she can \nlead the world spiritually, if awakened. Awakening is love for God in the form of Jesus, God \ncrucified. And God will do it. He can do it. And now the time is near, very near, when the \nspiritual upliftment has to take place. America is destined to lead the world spiritually. \nTruth never fails, and lovers of God will soon triumph. \nIn this country at present, unfortunately, the youth is not taught spirituality.

Just \noutside of Prague, Oklahoma, Baba's car was involved in a collision with a car driven by a \nparaplegic. Baba, his closest woman disciple, Mehera, and Elizabeth Patterson, the driver, \nwere seriously injured. After treatment at the Prague hospital, Baba and his party returned \nto Myrtle Beach to recuperate.\" \nBili Eaton, AL p15 \nThe accident took place Saturday May 24, 1952. Ned Burleson, the doctor who treated them, \nobserved: \n'When I finally got around to treating Baba, I was surprised to see an individual who was \ninjured as badly as he was still smiling. I was also astounded to find that he did not speak a \nword or make any sound denoting discomfort.' \nBaba told Ivy Duce, 'You must understand that this was God's will, and it will result in \nbenefit to the whole world.' \nBaba dictated a message on June 13th at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which read in part: \n\"The personal disaster, for some years foretold by me, has at last happened while crossing \nthe American continent - causing me through facial injuries, a broken leg and a broken arm, \nmuch mental and physical suffering. \n\"It was necessary that it should happen in America. God willed it so.\" \nOn another occasion, he commented, 'America has been wanting my blood for a long time.' \nLA p400, LC p15-16, HM p95-102 \nHe explained later, \"I got my physical bones broken so as to break the backbone of the \nmaterial aspect of the machine age, while keeping intact its spiritual aspect.\" \n(5 February 1959, Ahmednagar, AO p173) \nBaba left the United States Monday July 30, 1952, on a Pan American Airlines flight to \nLondon. \n\"When I was in America, people asked me when I would break my silence. I in turn asked \nthem, 'If my silence cannot speak, of what avail would be speeches made by the tongue?' \n\"When God thinks my speaking would be heard universally, he will make me break my \nsilence. However, silence or no silence, he who would deeply ponder over the truth which I \ndeclare shall eventually be initiated into the life eternal.\" \nMeher Baba, India, November 1952, Aw 5:4 p35.Also GM p199 \nFor accounts of Baba's visit to America in 1952, see M p206-211, \nGG2, GM p201-204, HM p82-135, and LM11 p3778-3885. \n1956 \nBaba visited the United States again in 1956. He arrived in New York July 20th, and left \nAugust 7th from San Francisco. \n\"I feel very happy to be with you all today. It is your devotion that has made me come to the \nWest during the period of my seclusion. If anything ever touches my universal heart, it is \nlove. I have crossed the limited earthly oceans to bring to you all the limitless and shoreless \nocean of divine love. \n\"Those who do not dare to love me seek safety on the shores. You who love me are \nswimming in this divine ocean. Love me more and more till you get drowned in me. Dive \ndeep and you will gain the priceless pearl of infinite oneness.\" \nMeher Baba, 22 July 1956, \nNew York, Aw 4:2 p33 \nQ. Have you heard of an American evangelist by the name of Billy Graham? Have you met \nand spoken with him? \nBaba: No. \nQ. Have you heard of his work? \nBaba: I know. \nQ. Can you tell us what you think of his work? \nBaba: Any work done in the name of God or Lord Jesus is a good work. But it must be done \nsincerely, honestly, without taking any pride in it, without wanting to profit through it. \n23 July 1956, New York, Aw 4:3 p18 \nin answer to a reporter's questions at a press conference \nWhile waiting for a television crew, Baba sat with a number of people in the barn at the \nMeher Spiritual Center in Myrtle Beach. This is a transcription of some of what was said, \nfrom a tape recording made at the time. \nBaba: I want you all to listen very carefully to what I say. It appears so simple, yet it is so \nvery important for my lovers. \nTo love me is to lose yourself in me. And to find me as your own self is to leave all your \npleasures and all your pains to me. What does that mean? \nWoman: Very simple. Just leave everything to Baba. \nBaba: Everything. And - remain happy. Leave your pleasures to me, leave your pains to me, \nand then you remain free. But it is a great thing, a difficult thing. \nSay you have three children, and all three of them die at one stroke. Naturally, what can you \nsay? You must not only say, but feel 'I leave all this to Baba. It is his wish it is his pleasure.' \nKabir said a nice thing. This morning when I was strolling here, I asked Eruch to write it \ndown. \n(Eruch, then Adi, read out the verse in Hindi) \nEruch: Kabir was a Perfect Master. All over India, people revere him. He said this to his own \nMaster. I will give you the English translation. Baba translated it this morning. \nNothing that I have belongs to me. \nAll that I have belongs to you. \nWhat will I lose if I surrender to you what belongs to you? \nBaba: That is what I want to tell my lovers. Your pains and your pleasures - leave them all to \nme. \n(later) \nBaba: I come down to your level to such an extent that I mix with you all... \nI appear to be gay, cheerful, playful. You have no idea of my divinity, my all-pervading \nstate... \nI have the greatest sense of humor, like Krishna. That sense of humor should not mislead \nyou or make you forget who I really am. Don't mix me up as one of you. It is possible only for \nthe saints and those on the higher Path, the real saints of high consciousness, to know me a \nlittle. If you had just a glimpse of me, you would lose your bodily consciousness completely. \nI am like a child, playful, free, and also like an old man. I am soft as butter and hard as steel, \nsimultaneously. Only those who love me sincerely, with all their hearts, can know me a little. \nMind can never know me. Mind can never touch me. I am beyond that, beyond mind. \nHere we are all sitting, waiting patiently for the television people to come. For me, this is all \nimmaterial. I do not like being bound by programs or such, but I do get myself bound \nbecause of your love. My lovers try to see that people in the world come to know of me. \nThey learn the truth that I bring with me, and they try their best in one way or another... \nThey have fixed this TV program. Therefore I don't mind even getting myself bound, though \nI do not like to be bound. Of course, you all have to wait patiently with me. There is no \nchance of leaving... Even if you feel thirsty, simply keep quiet about it... \nI asked Don to be here in ten minutes. He said, 'Yes, Baba, ten minutes.' I think - not less \nthan thirty minutes. Whenever I ask anyone here how long you will take to do this or that, \nyou simply say, 'Baba, just a minute', 'Baba, wait a minute and I'll be doing that'. 'Just five \nminutes, Baba, and I will be coming.' And I know simply to multiply by five. \nI had a center at Toka, forty miles from Ahmednagar. There were many boys in the center. \nThere's a book about it.* A separate section was for the boys. The grown up Mandali were \nalso there, and the women Mandali, each in a separate section. It was a very big colony, \nabout 500 people altogether. And I used to stay in the big table. Some of you have seen the \ntable at Meherabad. There is a small cabin underneath the table, and at that time I used to \nlive in it. \nFor days together I used to remain on fast, sometimes only on plain water, sometimes \ntaking coffee. Of course, I was not in seclusion. At that time I would allow people to come \nnear me. They used to come just for my darshan, as we say in India, to see and meet me, to \nreceive my blessings and love. I used to be very active, although remaining there in the \ncabin under the table. \nOnce it happened a man came there, dressed in a yellow robe, with beads, a long rosary in \nhis hand, a beard. In India you find many like that, hermits. We call them mahatmas, sadhus. \nThe sign is a long beard, a long robe, a rosary, and a necklace of beads. \nHe came to me and said, 'Baba, I surrender to you.' As he approached me he prostrated \nhimself and said, 'All that I have, I surrender to you.' I said, 'All right, good.' Then he left. \nThe next day he came again with his wife and seven children. And he said, 'Baba, here is all \nthat I have. I surrender them to you.' \nThe poor fellow was starving. He couldn't earn anything or feed his family. In India, the sign \nfor those who are on the spiritual Path is that they surrender tun, mun and dhun - body, \nmind and life. He knew that when one approaches a spiritually Perfect master, it is \ncustomary to say, 'I surrender all,' that is, body, mind and possessions. So I said, 'All right, I \nam pleased.' And the next day, he brings all his possessions. \nNow who are the six persons who have not received prasad? In India, people receive prasad \nwith great reverence, knowing that it's a gift of God to man, a gift of love from God to man. \nWho can catch? \n26 July 1956, Myrtle Beach, \nSouth Carolina, Aw 4:4 p18-20 \n*Sobs and Throbs, by Ramjoo Abdulla \nIn a discussion of groups of his followers in the United States, Baba explained, \n\"What I want is love, and to make others know about truth... what I say about truth and love \nfor humanity. So naturally you have groups and offices. Everything should be done in \nharmony. Each group should cooperate with each other. \n\"If someone belongs to the Sufis today, and wants to join John Bass' group, he can do so. But \nif he then tells John his group is hopeless, useless, and goes back to the Sufis and condemns \nJohn's group, the grace of my love is set aside. I don't like backbiting, criticism, confusion, \nwhich creates misunderstanding and confusion... \n\"If you want to change groups, do it, but do not keep going back and forth.\" \nSam Cohen asked Baba, \n\"Suppose one feels that meditating by oneself is service? I like to visit the Monday group, \nbut not all the time.\" \nBaba answered, \n\"I would like you all to belong to certain groups. Why? Because you can cooperate and tell \nothers about me and share your thoughts. You learn much more than when you remain by \nyourself. \n\"When you listen, exchange thoughts, prayers, my presence is there. Where there are five \ncollected together, Parameshwar is there, I am there. If you are talking of me, having love \nfor me, then there I am... Is it all clear?\" \nBili Eaton asked how they should conduct the meetings. \nBaba replied, \"Why be bound by my instructions? Be free.\" \n29 July 1956, Myrtle Beach, Aw 4:4 p31-32 \nAnother version: HM p264-265 \nFor more of this discussion, see Notes: Work for Baba \nVisiting Meher Mount in Ojai, California in 1956, Baba \"said the land was very old, and he \nhad been here before\" \nFilis Frederick, \nGl Aug. 1994 p21 \nThe book LIFE AT ITS BEST contains a number of messages Baba gave in America in 1956. \nAn account of Baba's 1956 trip to America was published in the Awakener Magazine,  4:2, \n4:3, 4:4. \n\"Now I will tell you about an incident. During my recent visit to America, a gentleman, who \nhas been staying in America for a long time, remained by my side during some of my \nprograms, and particularly when the films and photographs were being taken. This \ngentleman has studied and intellectually grasped what I have said, but misused it. From one \nof the letters from the U.S.A., I hear that this gentleman has started telling people that he is \nBaba's representative. Those who know me for so many years are not affected. But the new \nlovers, though educated, are very much impressed and flock around him. Just see how even \nthe Westerners are misled. \n\"What is the remedy for this? I will tell it now. It will be very useful only if you grasp it \nthoroughly. If all of you are convinced that Baba is the Avatar, God incarnate, the question of \nconfusion does not arise at all. In this case, just hold fast to my damaan* and close all doors \nfor confusion and conflict to enter your minds. If you are not convinced, leave me. Seek \nsomeone else. But if you try to stick to me with a wavering mind, without being convinced of \nmy divinity, you will be just like a nut caught in the crusher.\" \nMeher Baba, May 19 or June 7, 1957, \nGuruprasad Poona, Aw 5:4 p22-32 \nFor more of this talk, see Notes: Saints \n*damaan: the hem of the Master's robe \n1958 \nBaba's last visit to the United States was in 1958.

    "text": "SNAKES \nWhen H. S. Dikshit asked permission of the Perfect Master Sai Baba of Shirdi (1836?-1918) \nto kill a poisonous snake, Sai Baba replied, \n\"No. We should never kill it. Because it will never kill us unless ordered by God to kill us. If \nGod has so ordered, we cannot avoid it.\" \nc.1916? The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi, \nby Antonio Rigopoulos, p222 \n\"... A five foot long snake was seen outside the kitchen with a sparrow in its mouth. Baba \nwas called, and he came with a few of the men. One man struck the snake on its back, and it \nreleased the sparrow, which flew away. Baba gave the final killing blow, crushing its head. \nLater in the evening after dinner, he remarked about snakes, \n\" 'Unless a snake is killed by a human being, it remains always a snake. Never leave a snake \nwounded, as it takes so long to die. Once wounded, a snake will always remain near you to \nbe killed outright.' \n\"On another occasion the men killed a snake at lower Meherabad, and Padri brought it to \nBaba, who crushed its head. To Padri he explained, \n\" 'In evolution, the snake form is like an entangled rope which you cannot undo or unwind. \nHowever, if it is killed by a human being the knot untangles itself, and the soul is free to \ncontinue on its way through evolution.' \" \nBhau Kalchuri, \nLM7 p2269 \n(28 March 1938, Panchgani, India) \nMeher Baba generally traveled third class by train, but one time he agreed to go first class. A \nyoung British couple entered the first class compartment and sat down across from Baba \nand Eruch Jessawala. The woman kept looking at Baba, whose head was wrapped in a scarf. \nAfter a long time Baba nudged Eruch and gestured, 'Tell her, if she has something to say, to \nspeak it.' \nEruch smiled at her and said, 'Do you want to ask anything? Do you wish to say something?' \n'May I?' she said. \nEruch looked at Baba, who gestured, 'Yes, go ahead.' \nShe began, 'I do not know why I am saying this to you, but I want to ask you something.' \n'Yes, speak up,' Baba encouraged her. \n'My husband is a government officer, and whenever he goes on tour I accompany him. But \nthere is just one distressful thing: while we are on tour, going to distant places, wherever I \ngo, snakes seem to follow me, and I am terrified of snakes. I just want to ask you, is there \nanything that will stop this?' \nBaba gestured, and Eruch spoke for him, 'Yes, I can tell you something for this.' \n'What should I do?' \n'What you should do is this: when you get to your town, go to the bazaar and buy a locket. \nTake a little eggshell, and burn it to ashes. Then place a pinch of the ashes in the locket, and \nwear it all the time. That will keep away the snakes.' \nThe woman was grateful. Her husband nodded indulgently. \nEruch concluded that Baba had agreed to travel first class to meet these people, who never \nwould have set foot in a third class compartment. \nOctober 1947? \ntraveling from Bombay, \nLM9 p3199-3200 \n\"Baba gave us orders to stay on the footpaths, to carry flashlights at night, and if we saw one \nof the poisonous snakes - which were plentiful because the land had never been cleared \nvery much except where the cabins stood - we were to repeat his name, and the snake \nwould go away.\" \nIvy Duce, HM p251 \n(1956, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina) \n\"He then discussed the snake question, for the woods at the Center, like all country regions, \nhave some poisonous snakes. He told us to be careful and to wear the right shoes - no open \ntoes. He said that if we did see a snake, to say 'Baba' and it would not hurt us. \n\"Even if we stepped on one, but remembered to say 'Baba,' it would not harm us. But if we \nwore open-toed shoes, and said 'Baba,' it would not go away. And if we did not pay heed and \none did bite us, he would drop us in the lake!\" \nFilis Frederick, \nAw 4:3 p26 \n(24 July 1956, \nMyrtle Beach, South Carolina)",

Adjacent to the \nashram, the Marwari was living on his farm, irrigating it by drawing water from a well in a \nbig leather skin bag pulled by a pair of bullocks. \n\"One of the bullocks had a large wound on its back which had become septic, and was not \nhealing. Baba noticed the injury to the animal, and suggested to the Marwari several times \nnot to work the bullock so hard, and to send it to the veterinary hospital for treatment. The \nMarwari promised to do this, but did nothing. \n\"Baba then sent Kalemama and Dhake to prevail upon the man, and remind him that mercy \nwas the fundamental principle of the Hindu religion. He should have mercy on the animal \nand get it treated, or purchase another bullock. Dhake and Kalemama tried to persuade him \nat length on April 14th, but the man would not agree, and countered, 'I simply cannot afford \nto spend two hundred rupees to buy another bullock just to satisfy your humanitarian \ninstincts.' \n\"Several days later, the Marwari came to Baba. He had no children, and requested Baba to \ngrant him the boon of a son. Baba promised, 'You will surely get a strong and handsome \nson.' \n\"The Mandali now thought, since Baba blessed him, that the Marwari would give the bullock \na rest, but they found out that he did not... \n\"Baba had assured the Marwari that he would have a son, and accordingly, his wife soon \nbecame pregnant. It was observed that the man was full of happiness because of this... \n\"On the 14th of July, 1937, he went on horseback to a nearby village. On the way back, while \ncrossing the river at Rahuri, there was a sudden break in the dam, and the flood waters \noverwhelmed him and carried him away. He was drowned. His body was found two miles \naway. Months later, his wife gave birth to a son.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, \nLM6 p2174-2176 \nDOGS (and CROWS) \n\"A person dies when his sanskaras are exhausted, spent in full. After a person dies, his \nsanskaras snap the mind's connection with the Gross body. And at that time he receives \nsuch a shock that he forgets every incident of his past life. But, even though the Gross body \ndrops, the mind and the Subtle body remain full of sanskaras. \n\"For the next forty to seventy hours after death, the attention of the sanskaras is centered \nmostly on the place where the body is kept. But, after that, there is no connection \nwhatsoever between the dead person and that place. Within the next eight or ten days, the \nspirit of the dead person experiences the Subtle state of either heaven or hell, according to \nhis sanskaras. \n\"After a person dies, many people perform rites and ceremonies for a long time. But all \nthese are useless. No ritual is necessary after ten days. However, the best rites would be to \nfeed either dogs or crows near the body, because they have Subtle sight and can see the \nspirit of the dead person.

They were, apparently, taken \ndown by the interpreter and written up in the third person. I have tried to return the \nlanguage to first person.

Just as there are seven planes of consciousness - seven spiritual states - so also are there \nseven states of understanding. It is always seven. The number seven is the divine number. \nThe seven understandings are: \n1. Instinct \n2. Intellect \n3. Inspiration \n4. Intuition \n5. Insight \n6. Illumination \n7. Realisation \nINSTINCT governs the animal world. \nINTELLECT, humans. \nINSPIRATION for those humans whose feelings are developed -- like poets and artists. \nINTUITION is for those advanced souls who have conscious visions and understanding true \nto the point. What you understand by intuition is always true. What you understand by \nintellect is sometimes true and sometimes not. \nSouls on the fourth and fifth plane have INSIGHT; their understanding is direct, without \nthinking with the mind. \nILLUMINATION means seeing God as he is. The understanding is divine. \nREALISATION is understanding oneself as God. \nMeher Baba, 29 September 1940, \nMeherabad, LM7 p2617-2618 \n\"Margaret Craske's dancers gave a performance for Baba, with one of the dancers doing a \nmildly erotic dance with seductive hip movements. I happened to be sitting next to a man \nwho, just before the performance, had been criticising dancing altogether, saying that he \nthought dancing was too sexual and unspiritual, and that no one should dance if they \nwanted to follow the spiritual Path. After the performance, Baba congratulated the dancers \nand asked, 'Do you know the dance I liked the best?' \n'No,' someone said, 'Which one, Baba?' \nBaba replied, 'The one with all the movements,' indicating with flashing eyes and waving \nhands the movements of the erotic dance.

    "text": "DISCARNATE MASTERS \nBook Two \n\"Realisation is only one. The difference between the Perfect Masters (Qutubs) and the \nMajzoobs is that the former have the authority to use the power they have, while the latter \ndo not. What a Perfect Master hands over to his chargeman is not power, which is already in \nhim, but the authority to use it. During his physical lifetime, the Perfect Master can do the \ngreatest amount of universal work for the good of the world. After he leaves the body, he \nenjoys eternal bliss, and though the power is with him, he cannot use it. For this reason, at \nthe tomb or samadhi of a Perfect Master there is spiritual power. But it is the faith of the \npeople in the disembodied Master which becomes the medium to utilise that power. That is \nwhy people derive benefits by revering a Perfect Master's tomb. But the benefit accruing \nfrom such sources and drawn upon by the individual's faith is invariably material in nature. \nInternal spiritual benefit can only be derived when a God-realised Master is in the physical \nbody.' \n\"There have been some rare instances of people deriving spiritual benefit from the shrines \nof past Masters or saints. But this spiritual benefit is derived only in special cases where the \nearthly connection of the receiver and the giver has been cut short by unavoidable \ncircumstances. Such instances are very rare and far between. Material benefit from \ndisembodied saints is more common, and is in proportion to the faith of the receiver.' \n\"There is nothing outside ourselves. Everything, like planes, heavens, universes, earths, \nbeings and things, are all within us. The Master gives the aspirant nothing that is not already \nlatent in him. He is only instrumental in rousing the aspirant to the awareness of the divine \ntreasure within him. He shows us the treasure that is already there. Duty therefore means \nauthority. It is for this reason that a Perfect Master is ever eager and longs to give up this \nmortal body which prevents him from enjoying his eternal bliss.' \n\"From the beginningless beginning, the Messiah or Avatar is the only Perfect Master who \ntakes birth on this plane again and again from age to age. The last perfect form of that being \nwas Rasul-e-Khuda, Muhammad. As Maulana Niaz Ahmed says, 'The name and \ncharacteristics of my friend vary in every age. His form changes, but the face is always one.' \n\" \nMeher Baba, 2 February 1923,  Bombay, LM2 p474-475 \n(Another version of the same explanation, RD p147-148) \nOrdinarily, at death, a spiritual teacher or Master gives up the authority to guide or help \nothers. There are, however, exceptions: \nTHE AVATAR, who maintains his connection with the Gross, Subtle and Mental worlds \nwhether or not he is incarnate. \n\"The Sadgurus lose connection with creation at the moment they drop the physical body. \nThe Avatar never loses connection after he drops the body, but maintains his connection \nwith all creation through the five Sadgurus living.\" \n(from notes dictated by  Meher Baba, NE p113) \nKHWAJA KHIZR, a Perfect Master of ancient times. Meher Baba explained that Khwaja Khizr \nis a discarnate Perfect Master who takes temporary human form whenever needed. Khizr is \nbelieved by the Sufis to have been the Master of Moses. Baba said Khizr gave God-realisation \nto Francis of Assisi (Aw 4:3 p34). Bhau  Kalchuri wrote that Khizr gave Realisation to the \nPerfect Master Narayan  Maharaj. \n(LM1 p31fn) \nMARY, the mother of Jesus Christ. Meher Baba said that Mary had been given authority to \ncontinue to help people even after her physical death. \n(source: Mehera Irani to Erico Nadel) \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "SPIRITUAL EDUCATION \nBook Two \n\"Once when speaking on the subject of sanskaras, Baba remarked that small children, owing \nto their innocence, were out of the influence of sanskaras, and were therefore susceptible to \nspiritual training, and could be easily led to the Path.\" \nCharles Purdom, PM p118 (1927) \n\"Baba likened the Path to God to four courses of a schooling, i.e. levels of education: \nPrimary: Observing ceremonies and the dry drills of religious injunctions. \nMatriculation: Service of humanity without selfish considerations. \nB.A.: Repetition of the Almighty's name with love. \nM.A.: The service of a Sadguru by following his orders to the letter in all matters.\" \nFrancis Brabazon, \nSW p281-282 (May? 1926) \n\"Baba explained that the kind of education given the boys in his school would help effect the \npolitical salvation of  India. Thus, besides the spiritual advancement that the country would \nexperience, it would also be benefited materially. \n\" 'By the time' Baba said, 'that the boys have completed the course, they will no longer have \nany bias or prejudice towards the religion of others, as people do now, causing so much \nstrife and slaughter. Leaders such as Lala Lajpatrai, who are great orators in the cause of \nnationalism, totally lack an inborn toleration. But our boys, in whom the seeds of hatred and \nfanaticism will have been destroyed, and a real toleration created, will teach a universal \nreligion for all.' \" \nFrancis Brabazon, \nSW p366 (April? 1927, Meherabad) \n\"This school is not like the schools you find in the world. Such worldly institutions of \nlearning are being run by the government, municipality, or charitable trusts. The object of \nMeher Ashram is quite different -- for spiritual education. And to serve that purpose, the \nmore troubles you undergo and the more you suffer, the more you will benefit. Do your duty \nfaithfully and conscientiously, and put it above everything else. Then you will please me. \n\"Neither praise nor blame should distract you from the path of your duty. Leave aside all \nother considerations but your appointed duty. If your conscience tells you that you have \ndischarged your duty properly, that is enough. Your conscience is the best judge. It is human \nto err, and there must be mistakes. You can only do your best. Always be on time. Look after \nyour work personally, and do not leave anything to others. Even if mistakes happen, they \nwill be overlooked and pardoned. If I scold you harshly about such mistakes, do not take it \nto heart.\" \nMeher Baba, 15 April 1927, \nMeherabad, LM3 p931, \nalso PMp118 and SW p 369-370 \nThree teachers in Meher Baba's school, Pandoba, Phadke and Ramakrishna Gite had an \nargument about the value of education. Pandoba felt that education had spoiled  India's \nfamily traditions and hereditary trades (in which, for instance, the son of a tailor becomes a \ntailor), and brought about great misery for the people. Gite was in favor of education, saying \n'Even a street-sweeper would sweep better if he were educated.' Baba explained, \n\"Education, however faulty and incompetent, is always better than ignorance. If not always \nbeneficial financially, it brings about a lot of good to one mentally. It is a step further in \nhuman advancement, betterment and progress. Under all circumstances, and in any place, I \nwould declare and repeat that education is good and does good. A system may be defective, \neven bad. Yet you must not blame the one for the other, the education for the system.\" \n2 June 1927, Meherabad, SW p390 \nAnother version: LM3 p943 \n\"You have no idea what sort of teaching will be imparted here. Such education cannot be \ngiven in any other school on earth, and those boys who study here are truly fortunate.\" \nMeher Baba, 20 July 1927, Meherabad, \nto his brother Adi, LM3 p953 \n\"Childhood is the ideal period of life in which to take an interest in spirituality. The \nimpressions received at a young age become deeply ingrained. \n\"Divine beauty, grandeur and bliss should always be impressed upon children, so much so \nas to fire their imaginations to the highest pitch about God and his greatness. \n\"The boys' enthusiasm for God, however wild, should never be curbed. On the contrary, the \nbest attempts should always be made to create in the boys a deep-rooted longing for divine \nupliftment. Never mind if all the boys go mad with uncontrollable enthusiasm and impulses \nabout spiritual matters. The aim of this institution is more to create divine mad ones than \nacademic degrees. And I prefer the former to the latter. \nOf course, all the boys could not be expected to become saints like Dhruva and Pralhad, but \ncertainly some of them will take to the spiritual life in the later period of their lives. The rest \nwill also follow after some lifetimes, if not earlier. The result of the present training will \nfructify in the end in all cases. Even temporary impulses and sparks of enthusiasm about \nGod-realisation hold some result. It is like a cash balance in one's account in the bank, which \nis utilised beneficially at some time or other in connection with one's spiritual \nadvancement. \n\"Adults rarely attain lasting enthusiasm or longing. When I give a fascinating discourse or \nlogical explanation about divine grandeur or spiritual bliss, even adults certainly become \nfired up with a longing to search for Truth and to fathom the secrets of the universe. But \nunhappily, their ardor and enthusiasm do not last long. The impulse of the moment rises \nand falls quickly in the absence of instant results. \n\"However, if a man were to advance toward Truth, experiencing different aspects and \nnovelties of the Path, his enthusiasm would remain pitched at the same level. \n\"Seeing extraordinary sights or having extraordinary experiences maintains the longing for \nTruth, but puts great obstacles in front of real advancement. A strong tea provides a very \ngood stimulant to the tired nerves, but it causes no real improvement in health. On the \ncontrary, the general health is usually undermined with strong stimulants. Therefore a \nperson should not strive after the novelties, lights and powers of the Path, which are many. \nThe goal of life, the realisation of Truth, should always be the only longing and desire of \nanyone. \n\"But even the temporary impulses of adults are not to be considered insignificant. However \nsmall or little the attempt in connection with finding the Truth, and whether physical or \nmental, it forms a valuable asset. The varying impressions of sin and virtue are spent, but \nspiritual impressions are not, and always remain to one's credit -- ever increasing, but never \ndecreasing. Hence, even the best attempts should be made for the temporary impulses to be \nexpressed also. A few stand the chance of contracting permanent longing through chance \ncontemplations, in spite of their advanced age. Enthusiasm, inner impulses, and even \ntemporary longings are to be welcomed as they often prove to be stepping stones to real \nlove.\" \nMeher Baba, 26 November 1927, \nMeherabad, LM3 p982-983 \nIn the Spring of 1928 Meher Baba sent Rustom Irani to England, ostensibly to recruit boys \nfor his school.

    "text": "AN UNIQUE INSTITUTION \nThere is much talk about Brotherhood, but not many attempts to make it practical have \nhitherto been made. An unique effort in this direction is now being made in India by \nMeherbaba, an Indian teacher, whose reputation for wisdom and sanctity is well known \nthroughout India. He has founded an institution, known as Meherashram, in Ahmednagar, \nnot far from Poona. Admission to this institution is free to boys, aged 10-16. Board, \neducation, medical attention, and travelling expenses are all provided entirely free of charge \nfor a period of 2 years. Boys of all races and creeds are welcome. There are already 80 boys \nat Meherashram. \nYet Meherashram should not be considered as a charitable boarding school. It is open to \nrich and poor alike. Religious scruples are strictly respected. No attempt at conversion is \nmade, but the universal truths underlying all religions are taught, together with full \nsecondary education. A staff of competent teachers is retained. \nParents who are interested should communicate with me immediately as a party of boys \nconducted by a Public School man will leave very shortly. A few selected boys will be taken. \nR. K. SAROSH IRANI \n38, Ashland Park Villas, W. 12. \nCharles Purdom wrote: \n\"... One of Baba's disciples, Rustom K. S. Irani, was sent to England to endeavour to get \nWestern boys to enter the school; but he encountered unexpected difficulties, for no one \ncould understand why free education in India should be offered to English children, and \nwhen these difficulties arose Baba sent him a cable telling him to return at once. \n\"The outcome of this visit was, however, that three English people who had come into \ncontact with Rustom set out for India to stay with Baba, and arrived at Meherabad in June, \nwhere they remained, living under Baba's direction, until January 2nd of next year.\" \nPM p125 \nThe three English people were Meredith and Margaret Starr and Margaret's sister Esther \nRoss. They came to stay at Baba's ashram at Toka on June 30, 1928. \nBhau Kalchuri wrote: \n\"... Meanwhile in England, Rustom tried his best to bring a few British boys to Meher \nAshram, but failed. As he was preparing to sail to America, Baba cabled him on April 16th, \n'Don't worry. Don't bring boys. Return.' \n\"No sooner had Rustom received this telegram than some of the British parents he had \ncontacted agreed to send their sons with him back to India. But now, according to Baba's \norder, Rustom could not take them. He left his address with them, assuring them he would \nwrite soon... \n\"On his return to Meherabad at the end of April, Rustom received Baba's permission to send \nfor the boys from England, and he made all the necessary arrangements for their voyage. \nHowever the British government refused to allow the boys to emigrate, and the plan was \ndropped.\" \nLM3 p1038-1039 \nMeher Baba visited the Dastur Parsi High School in Nasik, which was located in a beautiful \nsetting. Baba liked the school, and suggested to the Zoroastrian priest in charge that the \nboys be given spiritual training. The priest was indignant, and told Baba that he was giving \nreligious instruction according to Zoroastrian custom. Baba explained to the Mandali with \nhim: \n\"Intellectual training itself is not sufficient. I know what sort of instruction these priests \ngive, as I myself studied in a Catholic school. Priests and dasturs are truly hard-headed. \nThese days there is too much stress everywhere on religion. Religion is the root-cause of all \nstrife, both internal and external, and is the cause of all wars in the world.\" \n4 October 1928, LM3 p1100 \nQ. For your present position, do you owe any obligation to your school teachers and college \nprofessors? \nBaba: What connection has education with Truth? \n1930s? A p52 \nMeher Baba visited Kolhapur High School, a school for boys in Kolhapur, on February 25, \n1930. The principal and vice-principal, Topkhane and Dixit, were Theosophists, and held \nBaba in reverence. Baba had a discourse read out on divine experience, love, grace, and the \nrenunciation of the ego. Baba told Vinayak Karnataki, one of the students, \n\"Dedicate your life to this school by renouncing your self. But let there not be even a \nthought that you are doing this or that for others. Only then will the ego-mind, the I, \ngradually diminish. Appear for the Bachelor of Science examination, and try to obtain the \ndegree, but do not feel glad if you pass or disappointed if you fail. Success and failure should \nbe equal in your eyes. Supposing you pass: do not think, 'Now that I've passed, I will be able \nto render better service than if I had failed.' This is not desirable. The I must not be there. \nThere should not be ambition. Except the existence of bliss, there is nothing else anywhere \nin creation.\" \nBaba then asked Vinayak what he was thinking. Vinayak replied, 'I want to get a Master's \nDegree in college. My parents have repeatedly asked me to do this.' \nBaba smiled and dictated, 'Very good. But will you invite me to this school again after you \nare so highly educated?' \nVinayak: Won't you come uninvited, Baba? \nBaba: Since you ask that, I will personally come for you next time. \nBaba was asked by the staff of the school to visit them again after he went to Madras. Baba \nsaid he would come if he could, and told them, \n\"In this Path, the heart counts more than the head. If both are good, that is best. But the \nheart should predominate.\" \nVinayak Karnataki later became a famous Indian actor. \nLM4 p1271-1272 \nand fn, also MMe 3:1 p81 \nMeher Baba visited the school again on April 13th. At the request of Topkhane and Dixit, he \nplanted a mango tree on the school's grounds. Baba gave the boys a discourse on meditation \nand the purpose of creation. Afterward, he told a boy to look after the tree, and 'said', \n\"As the tree grows and selflessly gives out its fruit to others, so also should you grow in \nmoral and spiritual greatness, and then selflessly serve others who are in need.\" \nBaba played cricket and field hockey with the boys, and told some visiting members of the \nIndian National Congress: \n\"With children I am a child. With the old I am old. With women I am a woman; with men a \nman. With the rich I am rich, and with the poor I am poor. Despite all this, I love children \nmost as they have no desires. I enjoy playing with them, and my playing with them makes \nthem drink wine (feel love), which they can drink more of while playing, and feel great \nhappiness.\" \nBaba returned to the school May 4th and 5th, and, as Bhau Kalchuri wrote, \"For two days \nBaba spent much time instructing the teachers concerning their conduct in running the \nschool and the boy's education. On on occasion there was a bhajan (devotional music) \nprogram.\" \n(LM4 p1305 - 1307) \n\"The form of service that a Montessori school takes has a practical value, if one's service is \nrendered selflessly. It is an important task, as it deals with the infant's nature in the prime of \nits development. \n\"The children's carefree hearts and restless pranks reflect qualities which are divine, and \nthey are blissful in their innocence. \n\"The task is to see how far you can make use of this divinity in man, expressed through the \nchild-God. \n\"A little patience, a little kindness, infinite understanding and sweet love are the only things \nby which the teachers can repay for having received the usefulness of human service at its \npurest. \n\"My blessings to all those who are genuinely responsible for having this school opened, as \nmuch as to the children who will attend it.\" \nMeher Baba, 18 October 1942, \nmessage for the opening of a \nMontessori school, LM8 p2820 \nOn February 3, 1954, Meher Baba visited and opened a junior high school boading-house in \nJarakhar, Hamirpur, that had been named after him. He cut a string of flowers tied across \nthe door, sat down inside, and the Mandali were served tea and refreshments. Baba said, \n'I feel happy today because of what my dear Shripat Sahai said about the boys school and \nhostel, and I wish that along with ordinary education, students here should also learn to \nlove God, who is the only reality. I give my blessings to them for this, and also my love and \nblessings to you all.' \nLM12 p4263-4264 \nAt a gathering a the Akhand Junior High School in Gauhari, Hamirpur, on February 9, 1954, \nBaba said, \n'When the fully grown, fully conscious man becomes childlike, desireless and lustless, he \ncomes nearer to God. \nWhen I am among children, I feel myself to be a child. When I am among the poor, I feel no \none is poorer than me. When I am among rich and influential people, I feel I am emperor of \nall. \nFor you students, two things are necessary: honesty and humility. By humility, I do not \nmean modesty, but that humility which spreads greatness. So if you students realise this \nmuch, then the purpose of my being among you is served. I give my blessings to you all. \nLM12 p4280 \nIn late February, 1954, Meher Baba visited the Gurukul Hostel, and played marbles with the \nboys there. Then he asked them, 'Who among you is the best singer?' Several children sang, \nand Baba accompanied them on a drum which he hung around his neck. Afterward, he told \nthem: \n\"Be honest. Never tell lies. Whatever happens, never tell lies. In this life I too was once like \nyou, a child. Now I am God. So you also can be advanced in this spiritual Path if you love me. \n\"Respect your teachers, your principal. Do your studies. Do your studies, but every day, at \nleast once, remember me. Then my nazar will be on you all. And my nazar being on you \nmeans I will help you in every way -- but be honest. \n\"Who would do as I have asked?\" \nMost of the boys raised their hands. Baba threw apples for them to catch, looking in one \ndirection and throwing the apple in another, to surprise them. \nMeher Baba, 28 February 1954, \nto boys at  Gurukula school, \nRajamundry, Andhra, AD p91 \nand LM12 p4336 \n\"Literacy is not education, and education is not culture. And all these together do not \nconstitute dnyan or gnosis.* This stands in a class by itself, independent of any concomitant \nfactors. Illiteracy and ignorance invite exploitation, but literacy can also become a willing \ntool in the hands of those who exploit. Education devoid of culture is inherently destructive, \nalthough on the surface it seems to represent progress. \n\"Since all types of people have claimed that their greatness constitutes culture, the word has \nbecome indefinite in the minds of the public. True culture is the result of spiritual values \nassimilated into life. Therefore you must keep before you the ideal of that spiritual culture \nwhich, once developed, imparts life and beauty to all undertakings - educational, technical, \nindustrial, social, moral and political - and pierces through their differences to produce \nunity. This results in the development of the highest character in the life of a nation or \nindividual.\" \nMeher Baba, before 1956, part of a message to students, artists, \nsocial workers and public institution servants, LH p180-181 \n*dnyan, gnosis, irfan = knowledge by experience of the higher planes, \nparticularly the fifth, sixth and seventh planes. \n\"Whether you like it or not, you must soon grow up and cease being childish. More and \nmore you must enjoy letting your teachers teach you and your elders lead you while you are \ngrowing into men and women. Unless you are willing to learn and ready to obey, they \ncannot help you as they would like to do.\" \nMeher Baba, before 1956, part of \na message to children, LH p179 \n\"Do not balk at the discipline given by your parents and teachers. Discipline in small ways \nleads to the greater necessary discipline of self. \n\"Do not try to conquer others. Conquer yourself, and you will have conquered the world. \n\"The simplest way to do this is to love God.\" \nMeher Baba, \nbefore 1956? NW p97 \nThe Principal of St. Vincent's High School in  Poona wrote a letter to Meher Baba, who had \nattended the school as a teenager. He told Baba that he was happy that Rustom and Sohrab, \nwho were the twin sons of Baba's brother Behram and his wife Perin, were attending the \nschool. Baba dictated the following, which was sent to the Principal: \n'My nephews Rustom and Sohrab should learn to think well of others, see good in others, \nmake others happy, tell the truth, shun all hypocrisy, and learn to love God. This is true \neducation. All other education is of little use. Those who educate themselves as above are \nmy real relatives.' \n2 May 1959 \nThe Love Street Lamppost \nJanuary-March 1998, p.14 \n\"Schools help sincere students to equip themselves with knowledge and to become worthy \ncitizens of society. And those students are wise who take full advantage of educational \ninstitutions and their facilities. \n\"But this knowledge is not the be-all and end-all of learning. And there comes a time when \none longs to reach the source of knowledge. \n\"The journey to this source can only be undertaken when one learns to love in all simplicity \nand honesty the one whom the pride of intellect veils. \n\"When mind soars in pursuit of the things conceived in space, it pursues emptiness. But \nwhen man dives deep within himself, he experiences the fullness of existence.\" \nMeher Baba, 1960s? India, IS p43 \n\"It is good to excel in whatever one takes up, so long as with excellence there is a feeling of \nhumility; for this leads to love of God, and to love God as he should be loved is the best \nexcellence.

The \nend will be the 5330th time - although the universe is never finished. \n\"So I am both personal and impersonal - and in the impersonal too, I am conscious. The \nunconscious ocean is Baba, in that conscious drop is me, and also in everyone, I experience \nmyself consciously.\" \nMeher Baba, April 1933? HM p453 \nApparently there is a larger cycle of 5330, and a smaller cycle of 24. \n\"I am the last Avatar in this present cycle of twenty-four, and therefore the greatest and \nmost powerful. I have the attributes of five: I am as pure as Zoroaster, as truthful as Ram, as \nmischievous as Krishna, as gentle as Jesus, and as fiery as Muhammad.\" \nMeher Baba, to his women Mandali \nDecember 1942, Meherabad, GO p72 \nBaba was asked about the number of incarnations he had taken, and replied, \n\"Whether there have been 26 Avatars since Adam, or 124,000 Prophets, as is sometimes \nclaimed, or whether Jesus Christ was the last and only Messiah, or Muhammad the last \nProphet, is all immaterial and insignificant when eternity and reality are under \nconsideration. \nIt matters very little to dispute whether there have been ten or twenty-six or a million \nAvatars. The truth is that the Avatar is always one and the same, and that the five Sadgurus \nbring about the advent of the Avatar on earth. This has been going on cycle after cycle, and \nmillions of such cycles must have passed by, and will continue to pass by, without affecting \neternity in the least.\" \nMeher Baba, before 1955, GS p266 \nBack to top",

    "text": "INFALLIBLE DISCIPLES \nINFALLIBLE DISCIPLES \nThe tendency to worship is very great in India, and is sometimes exercised uncritically. This \nhas happened with Meher Baba's Mandali, who are sometimes worshipped and believed to \nbe infallible. Westerners are also prone to excessive devotion to individual Mandali \nmembers. Some followers try to obey one or several of the Mandali. They believe that Baba \nspeaks through the Mandali member, by virtue of his or her long connection with Baba. \nMeher Baba warned about this on several occasions. This was one: \n\"... If Mandali advise you, when asked by you, don't take the advice as from me. They will \ndefinitely advise you for the best, because they have been long with me, yet do not take their \nadvice as from me... \n\"You can trust them not to mislead you purposely. But after asking them for advice and help, \nyou should also think of it yourself. For after all, Mandali are not Baba... \n\"Let us be very honest, absolutely honest. Adi has been with me like the few tested Mandali \nfor a long period, and he has been doing office work for twenty years 100%. And even then, \nas I said, no one of my Mandali is Baba. Everyone has got weaknesses and defects. Advice \nyou can have from Adi, but not as from Baba through Adi.\" \nMeher Baba, 2 March 1954 \nAndhra, AD p116, 120-121 \nBaba commented on the differences between different kinds of followers: \n\"The number of my devotees is great, but the number of my disciples is much less. \n\"The devotee seeks the pleasure of his own devotion, while the disciple's only duty is to \nobey the commands of the Master, which is much more difficult. \n\"Devotees select their own Master and surrender to him. A Master selects his own disciples. \nTherefore, many can become devotees, but only a few can become disciples. \nMeher Baba, 9 June 1926 \nMeherabad, LM3 p809 \nBaba explained that not all his Mandali or disciples were alike: \n\"There are three types of disciples: those who help, those who are a burden, and those who \nare a hindrance. \n\"Those who lift me up and carry me are the best helpers. The ones who may not be able to \nlift me up, but who give me their companionship, assist my work well, and also render much \nhelp. \n\"But the person who is unable to lift me up and is stubborn, refusing to allow me to lift him, \nis a burden and obstructs me in my work. The obstructionist is the man who does not allow \nme to lift him up, and who does not give me his companionship, but on the contrary, pulls \nmy hand from behind, thus obstructing my work by fighting with me even when I try to lift \nhim.\" \nMeher Baba, 31 March 1932 \non the ship Conte Rosso, en route from \nBombay to Port Said, Egypt, LM5 p1547 \n\"Members of my Mandali are of three types. The first group is like milk mixed with salt. The \nsecond is like milk mixed with dirt. The third is like milk and sugar. \n\"Milk is comparable to love, service, devotion, obedience, etc., attributes which every one of \nthe Mandali has for me. But alongside these qualities there is contrariness in their behavior. \nI look around at each one and find that all are not equal. When I seem to be sad and \nsuffering, some feel deeply for me, some take it lightly or indifferently, thinking that I am the \nPerfect Master and can withstand all that, and some are of the opinion that I purposely \ncreate all these complications and difficulties that cause me so much strain and suffering. \n\"I know well that you all have love, devotion and faith in me, but I behave differently with \nyou because of your varying behaviors. \nYou who are of my Circle should only pay attention to your duties. By creating different \ncircumstances, I afford you the opportunity to serve me. But you spoil the milk by mixing \nsalt or dirt in it when you disobey my instructions. Continue putting sugar in the milk to \nmake me happy - always keeping me happy is to mix sugar in the milk. \nMeher Baba, 17 June 1935 \nMount Abu, LM6 p1964 \nBaba also discouraged the belief that the people who lived with him were in some way \nsuperior to his other followers. He once told a large group visiting him, \n\"Are you all not members of the Mandali? Do you not love me? Why all this talk? What is this \nnew thing you have started now? For example, for the last four years I have been wearing \nthis pair of sandals. The sandals go with me wherever I go. I should also describe the \nqualities of my sandals. \n\"Who raised this point about the Mandali? There are so many others who are of the \nMandali. What about so many who are not here, but are in the West, East and distant places? \nMost of them are gems. \n\"Are you not all of my Mandali? Is not your love and obedience equally great? I do not like \npointed individual references to the Mandali members. There are so many amongst you \nwho are gems. \n\"Look at Dr. D., look at his age. He goes out from place to place. Look at K.S., how he works \nand how he has sacrificed. Look at M. Why should I not refer to them and many others \namong you present here? Why particular mention of some of the Mandali? \n\"I tell you, those who love Baba and tell others of Baba's love are his Mandali. It won't make \nany difference whether they are near Baba or stay a thousand miles away.\" \n1955, Meherabad, LJ p58 \n... Even the closest disciples of a Master misunderstand his work. \nMeher Baba, 18 July 1933 \nPortofino, Italy, LM5 p1798 \nFor more about the Mandali, see the chapter THE MANDALI \nBack to top",

    "text": "SMOKING AND DRINKING \nGOD-REALIZATION IN THE DISTANT FUTURE \nThe shackles which hold the soul in spiritual bondage chiefly consist of wrong values of \nfalsehoods concerning valuation. But some falsehoods, which are of the nature of false \nbeliefs, also play an important part in holding the soul in spiritual bondage. False beliefs \nimplement false values. But they also in their turn gather strength from false values in \nwhich the soul has been stuck up. All false beliefs are as much creations of maya as false \nvalues. And false beliefs as well as false values are among the clutches which maya uses in \norder to hold the soul in ignorance. \nMaya becomes irresistible by taking possession of the very seat of knowledge, which is \nhuman intellect. It is difficult to surmount maya because, when the intellect is under the \nsway of maya, it creates barriers and upholds false beliefs and illusions. It creates barriers \nto the realisation of the Truth by the persistent attempt to sustain and justify erroneous \nbeliefs. The intellect which functions in freedom prepares the way to the Truth. But the \nintellect which plays into the hands of maya creates obstacles to true understanding. \nThe false beliefs created by maya are so deep-rooted that they seem to be self-evident. They \ntake on the garb of veritable truths. They are accepted without question. \nMeher Baba, 1942? \nIndia, Di v5 p72 \nSMOKING AND DRINKING \nIt is commonly believed that Baba forbade the use of mind-altering drugs, but approved of \nthe use of alcohol and tobacco. This is not true. \n\"I must ask all aspirants to remember once and for all, that if they are desirous of rapid \nprogress and quick enlightenment, they should... avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea \nis not an intoxicant, provided it is weak. But be moderate in your habit of tea drinking.\" \nMeher Baba, Ms 2:2 p8 (February 1930) \n\"For all human beings, materialists as well as spiritual aspirants, use of tobacco or wine in \nany form, of bhang-ganja and opium, etc., is injurious, physically, mentally and spiritually. \n\"Tea or coffee, though injurious, is not so injurious as tobacco, alcohol, bhang-ganja, and \nother strong intoxicants. Rather these - tea or coffee - are in some cases beneficial, \nparticularly when medically advised and taken in mild form. Excessive use of these, and in \nstronger forms, is as injurious as tobacco, alcohol, etc.\" \nMeher Baba, MG 3:1 p22, March-April 1934 \n\"Recourse to alcohol for drowning one's sorrows is a perverted form of solace. \n\"Solace afforded by things outside of you is synonymous with doping, which gives a certain \namount of relief or relaxation. Real and unalloyed solace is within you.\" \nMeher Baba, 1930s, A p26 \n\"Alcoholic drinks in ordinary moderate doses act as stimulants and are harmless. If taken in \nexcess they are harmful. \n\"Drugs, whether in small or large doses, are injurious. They have a characteristic of making \nthe users addicts. Starting from small doses and very subtly, they tempt the partakers to \nincrease the quantity indiscriminately until they cannot do without them and become \naddicted. \n\"Tobacco and smoking has only the slight advantage of deriving superficial pleasure, which \nis temporary. But there are three distinct disadvantages: physical, mental and habitual. \nPhysically, it spoils the system, and mentally, it tortures one when unavailable.\" \nMeher Baba, 23 February 1938 \nLM7 p2267 \nFor more on this, see the chapter DRUGS in Book One and Book Two. \nBack to top",

    "text": "IN SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS \nAnother common misconception is that Baba will not incarnate until after 700 years. Baba \nexplained that his 'major advents' take place every 700-1400 years, but that in between he \ntakes 'minor advents.' \nAccording to Pukar, one of Baba's Mandali, Baba once explained that he takes three 'minor \nadvents' between each pair of 'major advents.' According to Jean Adriel, Baba said that his \n'minor advents' are continual; in other words, he is always incarnate. \n\"In the intervals between Avataric periods, the one Avatar continues unbroken his \nsuccessions, but the positions he assumes on earth are of less universal spiritual \nsignificance, though always his role is one of beneficial help to struggling humanity. \n\"There are times - when world conditions demand it - that he occupies many bodies during \none and the same period. As a genius of the arts, he quickens man's higher sense; as a \nmaster of poetry, he unfurls for man another petal of the cosmic rose; as an inspired \nscientist, he reveals to humanity the hidden secrets of nature; as a great leader of church or \nstate, he lifts mankind to a broader concept of life; or, as a nameless wanderer over man's \nearth, he cheers the disheartened, and eases man's burdens. \n\"No generation is without his physical manifestation in one form or another, though often \nhis true identity remains hidden - his presence on earth unknown to mankind.\" \nJean Adriel, Av p50 (1947) \nI asked Kitty Davy about this in the 1970s, and she replied that Baba had indeed said he \nincarnates continually. She also suggested that new people would find this confusing, and \nrecommended that they not be told about the 'minor advents' until they'd had some time to \ndigest Baba's more elementary teachings. \nWalter Mertens asked Baba about the 'minor advents' in 1938. \n\"When we got back, I asked Baba how reincarnations on a low level fit in. Baba answered, an \nAvatar is always on the seventh plane, and always the same one. But just as Harin al Raschid \nwas the king and always on the throne, even though he often disguised himself as a beggar, \ncraftsperson, or even as a thief on account of his work, so an Avatar might sometimes take \nan outwardly lower form, though he is always consciously behind that form on account of \nhis work.\" \nWalter Mertens, 3 December 1938 \nAw 21:2 p25 \nBack to top",

The main \ndisadvantage is that eating meat increases sexual desires... \nSo if we eat meat, the degree of sexuality increases in us. But if we remain on vegetarian \nfood, then it neither increases nor decreases.\" \nMeher Baba, 26 April 1924 \nMeherabad, LM2 p626 \n\"Among all foods, milk is the best, because nothing is killed in obtaining it.

Don't partake of even eggs.\" \nMeher Baba, February 1930 \nMs 2:2 p8 \n\"For years I have been a vegetarian... My Mandali have also been eating only vegetarian food \nfor years now... \n\"Milk is the best food. It sustains the body and purifies the mind. And the more the mind \nbecomes pure, the more it can be controlled. Desires become less, which is necessary for \nspiritual aspirants, as there is no progress on the Path without the mind being under \ncontrol. So long as desires and longings persist, the mind cannot be controlled. From that \nstandpoint, therefore, milk is the best food. \n\"The Parsis defame me, and call me shaitan - devil - simply because I do not eat meat and \nfish. I don't drink liquor, and have never been to a brothel. \nTheir definition of a Parsi is that he should be a non-vegetarian, drink wine, and lead an \nimmoral life, while at the same time wearing the religious symbols of the sadra and kusti, \nvisiting the fire temple, and paying heed to the priests.

He required that those who lived with him abstain from eating meat, \nfish and eggs. \n\"... Until 1932, Meher Baba did not allow his Mandali to have eggs, so they could not even eat \ncakes or chocolates. Because of that restriction, during Baba's first visit to the West, the \nMandali who accompanied him had to appease their hunger mostly with bread and butter, \nand it was winter. Nevertheless, Baba gradually granted them permission to have eggs, and \nafter a few years, fish and meat if they so desired.\" \nBal  Natu, GG1 p316 \nIn the 1930s Baba made exceptions for some of the Westerners. In the late 1940s Baba \nlifted many restrictions, including those on diet, for those who lived away from him. In the \n1950s and 60s he permitted his Mandali to eat whatever they wanted. \nSome of the Mandali went back to meat-eating, and this may have led to the misconception \nthat Baba ordered it. It was, however, their own choice when given freedom to eat as they \npleased. Dr. Ghani, for example, had a great attachment to eating meat. He tried to convince \nBaba that meat-eating was better than vegetarianism: \nAbdul Ghani: Flesh-eaters, similar to lions and tigers, are very powerful and energetic \ncreatures. Their stomachs are never bloated. But the grass-eating bullock has a big stomach \nwithout the strength, power and courage of the carnivores. So if the Mandali become non-\nvegetarians, we will be strong like lions. \nBaba: The elephant is also a vegetarian, and just see how strong he is. Why don't you be like \nan elephant instead? \nGhani: But the elephant carries a big stomach. \nBaba; Then let your stomach grow. Your stomach should be as big as your head. Then you \nwill look fine. So take plenty of vegetarian food while you're here. \n10 February 1940, Bangalore, LM7 p2514 \nDuring the last twenty years of his life Meher Baba did not, as a rule, enforce dietary \nrestrictions on his followers. Rather he encouraged them to become detached. \n\"I allow vegetarians to follow their diet, and non-vegetarians to eat meat, fish, etc.\" \nMeher Baba, 1 March 1953 \nRishikesh, India, LC p20 \n\"Some make much about diet. Everything has its merits and demerits.\" \nMeher Baba, c.1960 \nGuruprasad, Poona, GG1 p318 \n\"Here are some who dislike meat, and here are others who like it the most. \n\"Dislikes bind as much as likes. My concern is to free you from both. Love alone frees.

But if the Truth were to be confined only to the future and not to \nthe past or present, it would not be infinite; it would at once become limited as an event \nwhich has its origin in time. \n\"All that life is and has is at once deprived of intrinsic significance if it comes to be regarded \nas merely instrumental to some far-off event. This is definitely a false point of view. \n\"Life is not meant to be rich in spiritual significance at some distant date, but is so at every \nmoment, if only the mind is disburdened of illusions. It is only through a clear and tranquil \nmind that the true nature of spiritual infinity is grasped as something which is not yet to be, \nbut which already has been, is, and ever will be an eternal self-fulfilment. \n\"When every moment is rich with eternal significance, there is neither the lingering clinging \nto the dead past, nor a longing expectation for the future, but an integral living in the eternal \nnow. It is only through such living that the spiritual infinity of the Truth can be realised in \nlife. \n\"It is not right to deprive the present of all importance by subordinating it to an end in the \nfuture; for this means the imaginary accumulation of all importance in the imagined future, \nrather than the perception and realisation of the true importance of everything that exists. \n\"There cannot be ebb and tide in eternity, no meaningless intervals between intermittent \nharvests, but a fullness of being which cannot suffer impoverishment of a single instant. \nWhen life seems to be idle or empty, it is not due to any curtailment of the infinity of the \nTruth; but it is due to one's own lack of capacity to enter into its full possession.\" \nMeher Baba, c.1942 \nIndia, Di v5 p14-15 \nFor more about this, see the chapter THE NOW. \nBack to top \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "GHOSTS \nBook Two \n\"Early in the morning on October 5, 1922, Meher Baba told the men he had not slept that \nnight due to a noise in the back yard. He described the peculiar noise: 'It was as if someone \nwere leveling the ground with a heavy roller.' Then he explained that it was a ghost. 'This \nspirit is always with me, wherever I go. He is one of the ghosts who Arjun saw outside the \nhut at Poona. Upasani Maharaj has put him in my charge. Some of you may see this spirit. If \nit happens, don't be afraid of him, and don't be afraid to move about in the Manzil during the \nnight.' \n\"Once while Ghani was massaging his legs at night, Baba further explained about ghosts and \nwhy he had his body rubbed. 'The physical contact of a human being with my body keeps \nthe spirit world away from me for the time being, and thereby enables me to snatch a little \nrest. My sleep is not the sleep of ordinary human beings. It is a sort of mental rest from my \nspiritual working. A spirit always accompanies me wherever I go and whatever I do.' \" \nManzil-i-Meem, Bombay, 1922, LM2 p420 \n\"While I was on night duty chafing his limbs, Baba explained to me, 'The physical contact of \na human being with my body keeps away the spirit world for the time being from me, and \nthereby I am enabled to snatch a little sleep. My sleep is not the sleep of ordinary human \nbeings. It is a sort of mental rest for me from my spiritual working.' \" \nAbdul  Ghani, MJ 3:3 p174, also HM p605 \n\"When Arjun Supekar began keeping nightwatch at the hut, Meher Baba told him, \"Always \nremain awake and never be afraid of anything.\" \n\"One night Arjun heard the rustling of leaves and was startled. Peering into the darkness, he \nsaw two gigantic figures who suddenly started becoming larger and more ominous, \nreaching almost twenty feet in height. Arjun became petrified and could not utter a sound. \nAt that very moment Meher Baba emerged from the hut, irritated, and asked, 'What's the \nmatter with you?' Arjun pointed into the darkness, but there was nothing visible. \n\"Meher Baba scolded him, 'Didn't I tell you not to be afraid when I am here? Those were \nghosts who came to me seeking rebirth. Such spirits of the dead have committed suicide and \nare unable to take another birth for several centuries. Every night such ghosts come to me, \nso never be afraid. They won't harm you.' But Arjun's health steadily began deteriorating \nafter that incident with the two ghosts. It was a long time before he became well again. \nBhau  Kalchuri, LM2 p362-363 (1922,  Poona) \n\"Quite often, especially in the earlier years of his ministry, Baba would have at least two \ndisciples press his feet, and they had to use considerable strength in doing this. His reason \nwas not given for a long time, but he did finally divulge that around him there were always, \nat all times, greate hordes of people in the Astral world pleading and clamoring for his help. \nThe disciples who pressed his feet were his shield against them, as they always ran \ninterference for his work.\" \nIvy Duce, HM p605 \n\"Lower spirits are those beings without physical forms whose sanskaras remain to be \nwiped out. They cannot progress after death until their unfinished sanskaras are worked \nout. As a consequence, they wander about on the lower Astral plane. For this reason, they \nare a source of harassment to living people. \n\"Suppose a man is destined to have a life span of forty years, but he commits suicide when \nhe is thirty. Consequently, for the remaining ten year period of unexpressed sanskaras, his \nspirit inhabits the lower planes, and at times is seen by some people as a spirit or ghost. To \nhold seances or to talk with the dead is no great thing, because such spirits are always \namong us on this living plane. \n\"There are advanced yogis and munis who converse with these ghosts who have committed \nsuicide, as well as with the spirits of the higher planes. These advanced souls communicate \nwithout using a medium. They live on both levels.\" \nMeher Baba, 2 June 1925, Meherabad, LM2 p720 \nGhosts are people who have committed suicide and have no body. They enter another body, \nand then make the body of whomsoever they enter do as they wish. \nMeher Baba, 15 December 1927 \nAhmednagar, LM3 p994 \n\"The Master delivered a discourse before his disciples on the subject of ghosts and \nearthbound spirits of the dead. An earthbound spirit wanders at night in the vicinity of \nArangaon. The Master asked us not to be afraid of him if we ever happened to see him. Such \nearthbound spirits generally seek the company of Sadgurus, and the spirit in question oft \ngoes to the Master to shampoo his feet soon after he lies down on his bed at night. A disciple \nasked, 'Can you not free such earthbound spirits of the dead from their misery by making \nthem reincarnate, or in any other way?' \n\"The holy Master replied, 'Their sanskaras are such that they drive them to wander on this \nGross plane at night. Sadgurus can certainly make them reincarnate, but what's the use? By \nwandering here, the extraordinary sanskaras of such restless spirits are worked out. It is \nbetter that their sanskaras should be worked out naturally than that they should be wiped \nout by Sadgurus.' \" \nK.J. Dastur, 1929, Ms 1:3 p20, also HM p637 \n(29 January 1929? Meherabad) \n\"Elizabeth and Norina one day told me a story about their stay with Baba in  Portofino, Italy. \nAt one time Baba occupied Lord Carnavon's castle on top of a mountain at Portofino... Baba \nhad invited a large number of Western disciples to stay with him. Each morning as they \ncame downstairs to breakfast, one or more of the guests would complain bitterly that they \nhad had very little sleep because of disturbances which they finally concluded must be \ncaused by a ghost. Baba apparently paid no attention. One night the intruder came to the \nroom shared by Elizabeth and Norina. They suddenly heard a tinkling clatter among all the \narticles on the washstand, such as the cover being lifted from the soap dish and dropped, \netc. Elizabeth raised her head and whispered to Norina in the adjoining bed, 'Do you hear \nwhat I hear?' Since they were both enveloped with mosquito netting, Norina seemed to feel \nsafe, and sliding down under the covers, she said in a whisper, 'He can't touch me.' Which \nsentence ended up in an outraged wail as she shrieked, 'He pulled my hair!' \n\"The next day Kaka admitted to them that a man and woman in the Subtle body had been \nracing madly over the castle day and night, clamoring for Baba's attention, and pleading \nwith him to release them from their earthbound state. Shortly thereafter, Kaka stated that \nBaba suddenly snapped his fingers, and the man disappeared. And only some hours later \ndid he dismiss or free the woman in the same way. Baba then told Kaka that in a previous \nincarnation he (Baba) had been a Master, and while wandering on this mountaintop, \nsuddenly encountered the girl, who had been having a tryst there with her lover. As Baba \nspoke to her, the man emerged from among the trees, misconstrued the scene, and struck \nBaba... The couple was karmically held to this spot for five hundred years until Baba freed \nthem.\" \nIvy Duce, HM p437-439 \n\"After staying in the old villa for awhile, some of the Western lovers had experiences... A \nperson claimed a spirit haunted the house and had stood before him, growing taller and \ntaller. One said her hair had been pulled as she slept; another heard noises. Late one night, \nwith these tales ringing in her ears, Delia DeLeon screamed at what she thought was the \napparition of the ghost. It turned out to be Margaret Craske leaning out the opposite \nwindow for a breath of fresh air. The next day, when they informed Baba about what \nhappened, he wryly commented, 'There is one thing I like about you Western disciples - \nyour courage.'\" \n\"Baba did confirm, however, that there was a ghost in the villa. Once while Kaka was on \nnightwatch, Baba had gotten up at midnight and told him to follow as he left the room. \nDescending the stairs in the pitch dark, Baba sat on one of the steps for a few minutes, and \nthen returned to his room. Kaka asked him why he had done that in the middle of the night, \nand Baba explained, 'There was a spirit  here who has been trying to get free for 500 years. \nTonight I have given him relief.' \" \nBhau  Kalchuri, LM5 p1781-1782 \n(1933, Villa Altachiara, Portofino) \nGarrett Fort: What is meant by possession? \nBaba: There are certain cases where the Gross body is compelled to drop before the \nperson's sanskaras are completely used up. Such is the case when a person commits suicide. \nThe body is gone, but the momentum of all the impressions goes on. The person is now a \nghost. The ghost wants to drink, eat, etc., very, very badly. So much so that it takes to \nunnatural resources by entering someone else's body. It awaits its opportunity. When it \nfinds you drinking it satisfies its desire by drinking through you, your body. When it has to \nexperience anger, then when you are angry it experiences it through you, your body. This is \na fact. \n14 March 1937, Nasik, LM6 p2139 \n\"Why be afraid of ghosts? A ghost means a human being without a body, and in that bodiless \nstate he has to remain as long as the sanskaras of his previous birth last. Then he takes \nanother birth. \n\"Ghosts are miserable. They have desires, like any of us. They try to come in contact with \nhuman beings to fulfill their desires. When it is dark and silent, their Subtle, smoky bodies \nbecome transparent. You have Gross, Subtle and Mental bodies. They have only Subtle and \nMental bodies. but these are not as limited as the Gross. When stretched out, their Subtle \nbody stretches out in all directions - upward and sideways. That makes you shiver and \nscream when you see them like that. Depending on their surroundings, darkness and \nquietude, they can be seen. Their bodies can enlarge and shrink. That is why in dreams the \nSubtle bodies go anywhere, stretching out and out. They can also be photographed in \nsuitable conditions, depending upon the surroundings, time, light, and the photographer. \n\"These discarnate spirits wish to contact living human beings. If Rano, a heavy smoker, has \nno body, and for some reason becomes a ghost, she does not get another physical body until \ncertain sanskaras are spent. They may be spent in one year or a million years. All depends \non the contacts made to spend one's sanskaras. \n\"For instance, Rano has her craving for smoking cigarettes. She sees Kitty smoking. She, too, \nwants to smoke, and tries to contact Kitty to have a cigarette. But contact with a Gross body \nby the Subtle body is almost impossible. Kitty feels the presence of a Subtle body and is \nscared. But poor Rano only wants to have a smoke. In some instances, she, Rano the ghost, \nbecomes so desperate that she waits until Kitty nods to sleep even the tiniest little bit, and \nthen smokes through Kitty's Gross body. \n\"The Subtle can enter any Gross body or thing. When it enters you, you don't even know it, \nand are not at all affected. But it can only enter your body when you are not conscious, \nwhen you are sleeping. How many spirits have been drinking tea through Norina when she \nis not conscious? But the spirit has no hold, it does not reside in you or possess you, but just \ngoes like the wind. And it only happens sometimes. \n\"Don't think about it, or you will go mad. It is of no importance, so trivial, so insignificant. \n\"Sometimes you feel angry for nothing. This might be some spirit wanting to spend sankaras \nof anger through you. But this is so unimportant, not worth thinking about. Our bodies are \nfull of germs, but we don't think about it. If we did, and tried to picture it in our minds, we \nwould go mad. Masters are so bothered by these spirits, you have no idea. They want to \ntouch me for liberation, and they do.\" \n11 November 1940, Ceylon, LM7 p2636-2637 \nMehera, Mani and Gaimai were bothered by a ghost in Lonavla. Mehera's arm was pulled \nwhile she slept. Mani's entire body was shaken. Baba told them \"Don't worry about it. I will \ntake care of it.\" After that the ghost did not disturb them. Later they learned that some years \nearlier a laundryman had committed suicide in the well of the compound. Baba told the \nwomen, \n\"Don't be afraid of ghosts. They don't do any real harm. The atmosphere is full of \nimpressions. Sometimes when you think you feel the presence of a spirit, it is not the actual \nspirit, but the impressions in the place that you feel. That is why I told you all not to go near \nthe well where the laundryman committed suicide. All those impressions of his are lingering \nthere, but I have now freed his spirit, so it is all right now.\" \nDecember 1942, Lonavla, LM8 p2825 \n\"... Baba sent a telegram to Eruch in Poona to come to Pimplegaon. When he arrived, Baba \ninstructed him to sleep close to him in his room. Eruch did not believe in ghosts, and \nalthough Baba had explained to him many times about disembodied spirits, he found the \nwhole thing hard to conceive of. \n\"That night as Eruch was sleeping, he woke up and felt some pressure heavy on his chest, \nalthough he could see no one. He struggled to free himself from the invisible intruder, but \nwas overpowered and could not utter a sound. He tossed and turned on the floor, and Baba \nwas watching the struggle from his bed. \n\"After a short time, the spirit departed, and Baba asked, 'Now, do you believe in ghosts?' \nEruch had learned his lesson, and said, 'I certainly do now.' \" \nApril 1944, Meherazad, LM8 p2945 \n\"Ghosts are departed spirits who have been too much attached to the Gross world. After \ndropping the physical body, they still desire to live in close contact with the Gross. They \ncontinue to gravitate in the lower Subtle and Astral planes. Their Astral sheath or envelope \nis automatically actuated by the impressions concerning the Gross, and keeps them tied \ndown to the Gross for long periods.\" \nMeher Baba, 1956?

Explaining, \nBaba said, \n\"Really speaking, there is one Master who gives Realisation. It is for Knowledge - Dnyan or \nIrfan as referred to by Hindus and Muslims respectively, that sometimes it is necessary to \napproach one or more Masters. It also (sometimes) happens that the Master who gives \nRealisation also gives Understanding. \n\"In my case, Babajan gave me Realisation, and for Understanding I had to go to Maharaj, \nwho took eight years to finish the process of Understanding. During this period of my \nprocess of Understanding, if I had connection with some others, I would have gone to many \nfor such Understanding. \n\"Such Masters who advance the student are also entitled to be called a Master, although in \nthe real sense, there is only one Master.\" \nRamjoo Abdulla, RD p152 \n(8 February 1923, Bombay) \n*'Memoirs of Gousya' - Ghaus Ali Shah Qalandar of Paniput, 1804-1880, a Perfect Master. \nAnother version: \n\"God-realisation is always given by one Master only. It is only for Irfan - Gnosis - that \nsometimes contact with more than one Master is necessary. \n\"There are numerous cases amongst Hindus and Muslims who have contacted two or more \nMasters. Very often it is only one Master that gives God-realisation and Gnosis as well. \n\"In my case, Babajan gave me God-realisation, and for Gnosis (Dnyan) I had to spend seven \nyears with Upasani Maharaj. During the period of my return to normal consciousness, if I \nhad connection with some other Masters, I would have surely contacted them too. \n\"The number of Masters who impart Gnosis to a disciple, each one of them is entitled to be \ncalled a murshid (guru), but from the point of view of Realisation, there is only one Master.\" \nTY p79-80 \n\"Another early disciple, Ardeshir Khodiram Irani, first met Meher Baba during this time, and \nboldly demanded of him, 'Give me God-realisation!' Meher Baba told him to wait until he \nwas ready. But whenever he would visit, he would pester the Master about it. Finally Baba \nbecame annoyed with Ardeshir's naive attitude, and said to him, \n\"'You really want God-realisation? The whole ocean will come in your cup. But if your cup \nbreaks, I am not responsible.' \n\"Ardeshir knew Baba meant that he would drop his body if he attained Realisation, and was \nshocked by the thought of dying. From that day on, he did not speak of Realisation.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM2 p592 \n(c. January 1923?) \nMeher Baba told Minoo Pohowala, who was in the habit of visiting saints, \n\"When you sink a well, you first select a spot before beginning the drilling. But if you stop \ndrilling halfway, and start anew at a different spot, you will never find water, and all your \nlabors will be wasted. But if you keep drilling at one spot, you will surely find water one day. \nA spirit of fortitude is required. If you are easily disappointed and keep trying at different \nplaces, you will never succeed. Similarly, if you continue running from one saint or Sadguru \nto another, you will never gain anything. Stick firmly to only one Master, and carry out his \nwishes. Dig, dig and keep on digging, and one day yoiu will get the water of Realisation.\" \nThat same day Baba met with Savak Kotwal. \nKotwal: I desire God-realisation in this birth. \nBaba: Either long for God or for the world. You cannot have both. It has never happened \nbefore, and it will never happen in the future. I know how much you want to tread the \nspiritual Path, and I will see that you enter it. You will make rapid progress toward that goal, \nand you will eventually be competely swayed toward it. \n2 June 1928, Meherabad \nLM3 p1050-1051 \nAlso see the chapters 'Liberation' and 'Perfection' in Book One and Book Two, and the \narticle 'God-Realisation' in Discourses (v2 p45-49 in the five volume version). \nGod-Realisation Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

He said when the question 'What is God?' is asked, the answer is 'What is not God?' \nHe then continued, \n'Age after age, from time immemorial, you have been trying to find God, but you do not do \nso. Only one in tens of millions somehow or other realises God. But why do so many \nsincerely, wholeheartedly strive to find him, and so few do so? If God exists, and he does, \nthen why cannot we find him?' \n\"Baba answered his own question. \n'It is foolishness on the part of man seeking to find him. How can anybody find something \nwhich is never lost? God eternally is. Stop your search to find him, lose yourself, and you \nwill realise him.' \n\"That is what Baba taught us: no sooner do you lose yourself than you realise God. Not by \nsearch, but by effacing ourselves. Not by asserting ourselves, that we are the ones searching \nfor God, postively asserting ourselves, but by losing ourselves in his love.\" \nEruch Jessawala, IT p23 \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

How can one be a good doctor, and use that science best? \nBaba: It is very simple - through love. If you love your work, you can do it with love, and \nanything that is done with love has perfect results. To be a good doctor, always have in mind \nthat to you all patients, good or bad, big or small, are equal. Treat with as much care and \ninterest a beggar as you would a millionaire. And in case you find you are not paid the price, \nyou must not for a moment think of refusing. It is simple and practical, and yet a good many \ndoctors don't observe this simple rule. Only if a doctor realises that one infinite God is \nwithin all, then that doctor works like a saint. \nI am a doctor of souls. To me, good and bad, all are lovable, and I help each according to the \nneed. But although it is simple for you to be a good doctor, it is very difficult to practise it. So \nmany things interfere: reputation, name, money, society, circumstances, and so on. Is it \nclear? You can be a good doctor if you take it to mind. You are such a fine soul. I will help \nyou. \n29 June 1934,  London, \nto a woman doctor and her sister, \nA p8-9* \n*Abridged versions of this quote are in LM6 p1884 and PM p255. In both books one line was \nleft out: \"And in case you find you are not paid the price, you must not for a moment think of \nrefusing.\" \n\"Baidul was the doctor of his village in  Persia. He would boil garlic in oil and put a few \ndrops of the mixture in the patients' ears. Taking my name, it cured all sorts of diseases. \nThus he made some patients well, and his fame spread so much that he even gave a dying \ncow some drops of the tonic, extending her life too. \n\"But the fact is that the patients did not get well by his remedy, but by his full and supreme \nfaith in me. Every evening he sits with me and I tell him to talk, and he tells me of Persia and \nother facts and stories. He says, 'Baba, only you made them well.' He never took money from \nany of the patients either. \n\"It is Baidul's firm faith that my name would cure the patients, and that made the tonic \nwork. Had he the slightest doubt, the faintest speck of wavering about it, it would not have \nworked, and no one would have recovered.\" \nMeher Baba, 17 October 1940 \nMeherabad, LM7 p2627* \n*During this period Baba's women disciples were forbidden to mention the name of any \nman while Mehera was present. When Baba told this story to the women, he substituted \n'Soltoon's sister' for Baidul's name. Soltoon was Baidul's wife. \nFor another story about Baidul's healings told by Eruch, see De p79-86. \n\"One of my devotees was working in an office, when suddenly he went blind. His family was \nmiserable because of his plight. He was treated by doctors and taken to an optometrist. But \nthey could do nothing for him except counsel patience. \n\"Chanji happened to visit the man. Chanji knew he had faith in me, so he advised, 'Keep \nBaba's locket in water, and apply the water to your eyes.' The man began faithfully \nfollowing the advice without resorting to any other treatment. He also stopped taking his \nprescribed medicine. Chanji sat with him as the man put a locket of me in a glass of water. \n\"After a little while he applied the water to his eyes. Chanji kept him company for the next \ntwo hours. Suddenly the man saw a black spot, and in it appeared a vision of me walking \ntoward him. He told Chanji, who was overjoyed. \n\"The next day Chanji again went to see him. His vision had continued to improve. He told \nChanji, 'Come closer. I can see you very dimly.' After that, his sight improved so quickly that \nwithin two days he returned to work, to the utter amazement of the doctors.\" \nMeher Baba, November 1940 \nnear Kandy, Ceylon \nLM7 p2634 \nReal healing is spiritual healing, whereby the soul, becoming free from desires, doubts and \nhallucinations, enjoys the eternal bliss of God. \nUntimely physical healing might retard the spiritual healing. If borne willingly, physical and \nmental suffering can make one worthy of receiving spiritual healing. \nConsider mental and physical suffering as gifts from God, which if accepted gracefully, lead \nto everlasting happiness. \nMeher Baba, 1952? PL p31 \n\"At the end of January Baba took us to Rusipop's* house in Ahmednagar, where we stayed \nfor just over a month. During that time we heard that there was an outbreak of Bubonic \nplague in Ahmednagar. \n\"India was then still under British rule, and they insisted that all the inhabitants of \nAhmednagar be innoculated against this disease. \n\"But Baba said, 'No innoculations for you.'

He singled out one young man who had not stood up. \nBaba: Why do you look so pale and tired this morning? \nMan: I admit that I do not feel well, and I did not get a good sleep. \nBaba: Why did you not rise to your feet when the others did? \nMan: I am a young man, Baba, and I did not want to complain like an old one. \nBaba (shaking his head): It is natural for those who have bodies to develop ailments. Both \nyoung and old alike can catch colds. Youth in itself is no protection against disease. In \nexceptional cases, such as the one who becomes God-conscious and does not return to \nnormal consciousness, such a one remains naturally immune to contagion. But having come \ndown to your level, even I can catch cold and become ill as naturally as you can.

Afterwards, Baba commented that Moses was a soul on the sixth \nplane who realised God when he died (GO p159). He also explained that RAMESES (the old \npharaoh portrayed in the film) had attained Mukti by taking Moses' name when he died. \nBaba also said the Pharaoh's son (portrayed by Yul  Brynner in the film) entered the \nspiritual path in his next life. \nFL p32 \nBaba's brother JAMSHED IRANI died February 26 or 27, 1926 (LM3 p779-785). Baba later \ncommented about his death: \n'If you love me, you are with me. Then you come to me. Through love, you can become one \nwith me. My brother Jamshed loved me very much. He was mad with love for me. Once he \nwas so full of love for me that he couldn't contain himself, and he dropped his body.

He is now with me \neternally.' \n21 July 1956, New York, Aw 4:2 p26 \n'My brother Jamshed, when we were boys, used to quarrel and fight with me. As he grew \nolder, Jamshed began to love me. Later on, in Meherabad, he couldn't sleep because he \nthought all the time about me. When he went to  Poona, all of a sudden he had a splitting \nheadache, and the heart felt heavy. And just before an attack of apoplexy, he felt very \nblissful. He shouted my name, and then fell into a coma. And during those three hours, his \nlips were moving with the rhythm, \"Baba, Baba, Baba.\" Mani was there. Then he died.

Tell me your desires now, and I will grant them.\" \nGopal was silent and smiled. Baba went on, \"Speak out. Empty your head and heart before \nme. Now is the time. I, of my own accord and will, am asking you to have your desires \nfulfilled.

However, after death, a person finds himself in a different atmosphere and in a \ndifferent body. Both death and birth are dreams. Where is the sense in being merry or \nmiserable for the sake of a dream? Bobo's death, however, is not sleep. He has gone beyond \nit and is awake forever. He is emancipated, and has been given Mukti - Liberation.' \nLM5 p1603-1604 \nNONNY GAYLEY died October 14, 1939.

Baba \nexplained, \n\"Warrior was not actually a dog, but was temporarily brought down from the spirit world to \ndo this work. I needed a dog for that kind of work. I won't go too deeply into the matter... \n\"When Warrior got very ill, I saw that if he died within three days, he would again have to \ntake another birth, which would not have been safe for him. I saw to it that he did not pass \naway. So when in those three days he did not die, I was happy. Now no more birth for him. \n\"When Masters touch the dead bodies of animals, the animals get human forms in their next \nlives.

He strove to alleviate the \nsuffering of all with whom he came in contact, and especially exerted his utmost bringing \nthe Parsi community to the pedestal of the true spiritual understanding through the contact \nand grace of Baba. For time to come, he leaves a vast record of events of Baba's life, with \ntheir spiritual significance explained. With Baba he traveled the world over several times, \ndrawing up itineraries and gathering the records of his Master's work with untiring energy. \nWhilst doing his duties as one of the most trusted and dear ones of Baba, he laid down his \nlife with the name of Baba on his lips.\" \nGO p84 \nBaba also said of him, \"Chanji was not only my disciple, he was my friend.\" \nGO p84 \nJAL KERAWALLA died October 6, 1952. Baba said of Jal, \n\"Jal lived for me and died for me.\" \n\"His connection with me was and is unique. His love for me was unbounded, his faith in me \ncomplete, his obedience to my orders implicit, and his surrenderance to my will absolute... \nMy beloved Jal has come to me eternally in peace.\" \nLC p17, GG3 p257 \nDr. ABDUL GHANI Munsiff died August 7, 1951. Baba commented, \n\"Ghani and Jal have won, that is what I feel. The last word that Jal uttered as he breathed his \nlast was 'Baba.' How fortunate. Indeed, such cases are rare.\" \nNov. 2 1952, GG3 p136 \nDAULATMAI IRANI, Mehera's mother, died November 4, 1952. Baba said, \"My dear \nDaulatmai, by God's grace, will live in me forever.\" \nGG3 p162 \nDr. NERULA, the principal of a college in  Amravati called Vidarbha Mahavidyalaya, met \nMeher Baba in December 1952. Nerula was a devotee of Ramakrishna, who died in 1886. \nBaba told him, \n\"I authoritatively declare that I am the Avatar, the Ancient One... Ramakrishna was a rare \ntype of Perfect Master. Go on loving him, and one day you will find him... A few hours before \nyour death you will see me in the form of Ramakrishna, and you will realise God.\" \nGG3 p248 \nMILDRED KYLE died in 1954 in  Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Baba dictated a cable: \n\"Mildred has found eternal peace in me.\" \nLater, when her ashes were buried at Meherabad, the stone over her grave was inscribed, \n\"Mildred Kyle has come to Baba.\" \nNOZHER DADACHANJI, a pilot in the Indian Air Force, died in an airplane accident October \n13, 1955, He was 22. Baba dictated a cable: \n\"I have physically lost my gem Nozher, and Nozher has gained me spiritually by loving me to \nhis last breath. Let us be brave and not selfish, but rejoice in Nozher's bliss... for such souls \nare instrumental in showing to us how to love and be worthy of the beloved. Baba\" \nGO p137 \nBaba told Nozher's father, \n\"If I had sent Nozher to England, and given him the order never to return to India, and if I \nhad then given you the order never to see him again, you would be happy that Nozher was \nalive and doing what I wanted him to do - isn't that so? ('Yes, Baba.\") I want you to consider \nit that way - that I have sent Nozher somewhere. Think that I have called him to me, and \nthat I am telling you never to see him again. What is this body, after all? Nozher wasn't his \nbody. The difference is that you can't see him now. I gave Nozher the order always to repeat \nmy name before flying, and as soon as he sat in the plane the last time, he came to me. He is \nwith me, and he is so happy!\" \nGO p138 \nLater Baba explained, \n'I am never sorry for anyone who dies. He who dies with my name on his lips, with me in his \nheart, never dies. I never worry about them, for theirs is no loss. If I am ever worried, it is \nfor those that suffer through the death, which they might allow to alienate them from me. \nThat would be their loss indeed. Why suffer unnecessarily? My dead live in me. That should \nmake you happy. So why not rejoice in his happiness? Loving me as you do, knowing me for \nthe one I am, you should be only happy to know Nozher is happy in me. Knowing this, any \nmourning you may do therefore must be for yourselves only, from selfish motives. You don't \nknow how fortunate they are who die with my name on their lips and in their hearts.' \nAL p94 \n'He was a handsome young man, and deeply devoted to me... As I had instructed him, he \nnever failed to take my name each time before flying... Nozher was one of my gems. He died \nwith my name on his lips, and has come to me... In reality, there is nothing such as death or \nbirth. I know this, and I say it with the authority of my conscious knowledge. We are all in \neternity, and we will always be there. Really, none comes or goes, none is born or dies. But \nto experience this truth, we must first free ourselves from the bondage of our ignorance. \nAfter a hundred years or so, you will all have dropped your bodies, and yet you will still \nexist. Do not think about your bodies, but think only about me. Then, before you drop your \nbodies, you will be able to remember me. My miracle will be to make you become me.' \nLH p85-86 \nBaba asked the family for a large photograph of Nozher. He kept it in his Rahuri cabin at \nMeherabad for some years, and then had it brought to Meherazad. \nMITHILESH, the three year old daughter of followers of Baba in  Dehra Dun, died January 3, \n1957 saying Baba's name. Baba said of her, \n'She is the most fortunate of fortunates, as are all who die taking my name.' \nFL p14 \nCURSHET TALATI died in 1958 in  London saying Baba's name. Baba told his mother, Dina \nTalati, \n'Be happy. Curshet is not dead. He lives in me.' \nFL p32 \nBaba said in 1958 that his aunt had taken his name when she died: \n'My name was on her lips when she dropped her body.' \nGM p337 \nAfter GADEKAR, an old devotee of Baba, died in March 1959, Baba's sister Mani wrote, \n'Baba told us only he knew how fortunate Gadekar was, who also with his last breath had \ncalled out Baba's name and had come to him forever.\" \nFL p50 \nSRINIVASAN MUDALIAR died in a fall from a ladder in 1959. Baba had Adi cable his family, \n'Baba wants the Mudaliar family to know that his dear Srinivasan has earned his nivas \n(abode) in his beloved Baba.' \nFL p62 \nMARY BACKETT died in 1962. Baba cabled her husband Will, 'My Archangel Mary has come \nto me after fulfilling her appointed task. Be happy in my love.' WILL BACKETT died about \neight months later. Baba cabled Mollie Eve, 'Both my dear Archangels Will and Mary Backett \nhave come to me for all time.' \nFL p142, 166 \nKODURI KRISHNARAO died in 1965. Baba wrote Krishnarao's wife: \n'Your husband Koduri Krishnarao's love for me and his service in the cause of the Avatar \nhave made him immortal. Krishnarao now lives eternally in me and is blissfully happy. I \nwant you to be brave and to keep happy in Krishnarao's happiness. My love blessing to you \nand your dear children.' \nBaba cabled the Andhra group, \n'Koduri Krishnarao was one of my dearest lovers, and has come to rest eternally in me.' \nFL p238 \nWhen BAPUSAHIB SHINDE died in 1966, Baba sent a message to all his centers: \n'Bapusahib Shinde has come to me to rest in me eternally. One of my dearest lovers and \nworkers, Bapusahib served me wholeheartedly and shared in my suffering.' \nBaba told the Mandali, 'I have lost Bapusahib Shinde, but he has found me.' \nFL p253-254 \nRAMJOO ABDULLA died taking Baba's name in 1967. Baba cabled his family: \n'My very dear Ramjoo has come to me to rest eternally in me.' \nFL p275 \nLiberation Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

The only thing needed is to \ntear open the veil.\" \nMeher Baba, before 7 October 1922 \nto his men Mandali, LM2 p428 \n\"Elizabeth: \nMy dear old friend and silent companion Gustadji Shilst, dropping his body on 30th October, \nrealised me as I really am. Inform all concerned. \nBaba\" \ncable to Elizabeth Patterson \n5 November 1957, India, LA p505 \nFor more on Gustadji, see LA p505, LM1 p260-261, LM2 p427-428 \n\"Masters of the fifth and sixth planes take unto themselves disciples, initiate them into the \nPath, and thereafter leave the whole responsibility for achieving progress in the Path to the \ndisciples themselves. Hence arises the need for papers on different practices and \nmeditation. The gain herein is in direct proportion to the exertion by the disciple - of course, \nunder the guidance and supervision of the master, who is the salik of the particular plane. \nThis rules out the question of the imposition on aspirants of disciplinary exercises and \nesoteric papers by unqualified and unauthorised masters. \nElect and Select Disciples \n\"The Perfect one of the seventh plane of God-realisation - the Qutub - has a different \ntechnique altogether in the matter of dealing with aspirants. Every Qutub has two types of \ndisciples - the Elect and the Select. \n\"The Elect ones are those who have a sort of spiritual relationship with the Master (Qutub), \nborn of services rendered or part played toward him, even antagonistically, in past \nincarnations. Such aspirants are invariably the claimants to the spiritual heritage of the \nMaster. And even if they appear of indifferent caliber in the present life, the Master trains \nand prepares them in his company to become fit and deserving recipients of his divine \ngrace. 'When the disciple is ready, the Master comes,' is said of aspirants belonging to this \ncategory. Their number is always twelve. The twelve apostles of Christ and the twelve \nimams of Hazrat Ali are suggestive of this situation. \n\"Select disciples of a Master have an unlimited scope, qualitatively and quantitatively. These \nare the fortunate ones who earn the grace of the Perfect One (Qutub) by sheer dint of merit \nand services rendered. The spiritual benefit accruing to this category is in proportion to the \nquality of their self-surrender to the will of the Master. It is such aspirants who are in need \nof disciplinary exercises and meditation papers. Visualising these two types - the Elect and \nSelect ones - I gave you the impression in my previous letters that exercises and papers are \nboth necessary and unnecessary. The Elect ones are the inheritors, and the Select ones are \nthe winners of the Master's grace. \n\"Thus, in the domain of Perfection of the seventh plane of God-realisation (the Qutub), the \nquestion of initiation and discipleship doesn't arise. Every atom of the universe is \nequidistant from the center, the Qutub, round which everything and everyone revolves. In \nfact, according to Baba, one is entitled to call himself or herself a disciple only after getting \nIllumination from the Master. Till such time, all - high or low, near or distant - are mere \naspirants, and nothing more. \nSaheb-e-Zaman or Avatar \n\"Baba stands in a different category altogether. Baba is not only a Qutub, but at this cyclic \nperiod in the history of the world, he is the Qutub of all Qutubs, the Saheb-e-Zaman or \nAvatar. Unlike all Qutubs or Sadgurus, whose Circle of intimate disciples consists of twelve, \nin Avataric periods the Avatar has a Circle of 120 disciples, 'all of whom experience \nRealisation and work for the liberation of others.' These 120 are heirs, by right of past \nassociation, to the spiritual treasure of the Avatar; and the beneficiaries thereof, as said \nbefore, are numerous. In fact, Baba has been heard to have remarked that besides his Circle, \nwho all will be as Perfect as himself, more than a lakh of souls will have Illumination at his \nhands before his mission comes to an end.* \n\"You will thus see that a Qutub, or for that matter an Avatar, never goes through the \nformality of accepting and initiating a disciple. The relationship with the Master known as \ndiscipleship has got to be formed and forged by the aspirant himself, the criterion for which \nis the quality of self-surrender. The Master, in due course, requites the aspirant's efforts in \nthis direction by imparting Illumination in proportion to the sincerity of purpose and the \nintensity of longing displayed. \n\"A master of the fifth or sixth plane (still laboring in the domain of duality) teaches an \naspirant to earn Illumination by self-exertion, while the Perfect one, the Qutub, bestows on \nthe aspirant by way of a gift his divine grace, for which the only condition necessary is to \nestablish a link or connection with him by self-surrender. \nAbdul Ghani, 10 September 1948, from \na letter to Ivy Duce, HM p718-719 \n*lakh = 100,000 \nIllumination = the conscious, continual experience of seeing God face-to-face on the sixth \nplane of consciousness \nMandali Book One \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

    "text": "BIRTH CONTROL \n(Shri Meher Baba's Views) \n\"Birth control, in itself, is good, provided the means utilised to practise it are mental, and \nnot physical or unnatural.\" \nShri Meher Baba \nThe birth control movement has been a subject of much controversy and wide discussion in \nthe present day world. the propounders of the movement advocate the use of chemical or \nphysical means for checking or preventing the birth of 'unwanted children.' Much 'religious' \nsentiment is also ushered into the discussion of this subject, both by the advocates and the \nopponents of this movement. \nEach leader or person in the public eye whose opinion has been sought, has considered the \nquestion from his or her own angle of vision or sphere of activity, e.g. social, medical or \nreligious; and as a Spiritual Master and the author of a spiritual movement, Shri Meher \nBaba's views are solicited on this point. His opinion, based as it is on spiritual \nconsiderations, is above everything. He does not consider the question from the point of \nview of any special or limited interest, but from the point of view of the ultimate and \ncomplete well-being of the individual and the society, for, as he has repeatedly said, \n'Spirituality includes everything.' \nThe present day birth control movement can be analysed into two parts: 1) its aim, and 2) \nits means. It aims at regulating the birth of children for a) eugenic, b) economic, or c) \npersonal reasons. \nUncontrolled breeding leads to the birth of diseased and weak issue, intensifies the acute \n'struggle for existence' and all the political and economical problems (e.g. crimes, wars and \npoverty), which are the inevitable outcome of ruthless competition, and often creates for \nparents a responsibility which they cannot adequately discharge. All these considerations \nare humane and rational, and therefore demand and justify serious attempts to regulate \nbreeding. \nThe purely physical means, however, which the enthusiastic supporters of the birth control \nmovement advocate, are found to lead to the following undesirable results: \n1. While the wealthier and the middle classes, who can afford to support many issue in their \nfamilies, have already taken to this mania of using contraceptives, the really poor and the \ndestitute, who cannot at all afford to breed children, either do not know enough about \ncontraceptives, or deliberately neglect to use them. And the result is that the uneducated \nmasses are multiplying as ever, and the educated and the rich classes are becoming thinner; \nand in the actual result of the use of contraceptives, the very purpose of securing children \nonly when and where they would be properly looked after, is defeated by the means. \n2. Further, the contraceptives, which are advocated on humanitarian grounds, are generally \nused by the majority of the people for serving their own selfish ends, and for avoiding the \nresponsibility of bearing and bringing up children. \n3. Since the physical consequences of the sex act can be so successfully avoided through the \nuse of chemical and physical means, those who have not yet begun to be awake to the \nhigher values have no incentive to be moderate in the gratification of passion; and they \ntherefore become victims to excessive indulgence in the satisfaction of sex desire, which has \ndisastrous physical, moral and spiritual consequences. Since the advocates of the birth \ncontrol movement are content to emphasise the need of the use of physical means only, and \nentirely neglect the spiritual side of the question, the younger generation is likely to become \nblind to the need for mental control, and might bring about its on ruin by becoming a slave \nto the animal passion. \nWhat then is the alternative? The easy physical means of avoiding issue are far from being \ncontributory to the awakening of man to his real dignity and freedom as a spiritual being. \nThoughtless and uncontrolled indulgence must inevitably lead to reaction and spiritual \nbondage. Only through the wise exercise of mental control is it possible for man to rise from \npassion to peace, from bondage to freedom, from animality to purity. \nFor spiritual aspirants in particular, and also for all human beings (because they are all \npotentially spiritual aspirants), it is extremely inadvisable to rely upon purely physical \nmeans for the regular breeding. They must rely upon mental control, which will \nautomatically result in the regulation of births. They can thus equally well achieve the \nhumanitarian purposes of the birth control movement, without incurring upon themselves \nthe spiritual disasters which must overtake them if they merely rely on the purely physical \nmeans advocated by the supporters of the movement. \nShri Meher Baba, therefore, throws light upon the much ignored spiritual side of the \nquestion, and advocates mental control, which is not only useful for regulating the number \nof children, but is also indispensible for restoring to man his divine dignity and spiritual \ngood, viz. peace, happiness and freedom. \nThe use of physical means for preventing the birth of children without mental control is \nspiritually disastrous for an aspirant. But is it permissible for an aspirant to use, in \nincreasing degree, mental control along with the physical means, if he considers that he \ncannot undertake the responsibility of children, and if he does not in any way slacken his \nattempts at mental control and sublimation, and if he sincerely uses the physical means \nprovisionally, and intends to give them up as soon as possible? \nBirth control must be, essentially, self-control (mental control) and nothing else. There \nshould be no second aid to it. And physical means, under no circumstances, considerations \nor conditions, would be advisable. \nIf one is not prepared to undertake the responsibility of children, there is only one course \nleft for him. He must remain a bachelor - a true bachelor in the real sense of the word. For \nmental control, although extremely difficult in practise, is not impossible. \nBut in trying to utilise any means other than mental, even with the motive of developing the \nmental through the physical, one does not attain self-control, much as he desires it. On the \ncontrary, being addicted to the physical means, he tries to justify himself all the more in the \nutilising of the physical means, and becomes a victim to the habit, rather than effecting a \ndevelopment in self-control. \nTo explain it still more clearly, what happens in the use of physical means, is that while one \nthinks that he is using them as a preliminary step before the mental control is fully \ndeveloped, he actually gets addicted to them, and becomes a slave of the habit of using \nthem. And though he may remain under the delusion that he is trying to develop mental \ncontrol through the physical means, he is, in reality, all the while, losing gradually. \nIn short, mental power is undermined by reliance on the physical means. Therefore the \nchances of one's developing self-control through physical means are absolutely remote. On \nthe contrary, there is always the risk of being a prey to the animal passion, and hence \nphysical means are under no conditions advisable, even from the best of motives. \nPreventing birth of children through physical means is most disastrous from the spiritual \npoint of view, and is positively detrimental to the development of self-control. \nAs a Spiritual Master, Shri Meher Baba would advise strict celibacy, but it is extremely \ndifficult, though not impossible. Hence, very few practise it. And so, for others who cannot \nobserve strict celibacy, the next best course, he would advise, is to marry, rather than \nremain a bachelor and fly like a bee from flower to flower. \nIf in marriage one learns to control animal passion, well and good. If he cannot control it, he \nmust let nature take its own course (rather than use any unnatural means) and bear the \nconsequences of shouldering the responsibility for upbringing of the children, and even \nsuffer for that. This responsibility must be accepted individually, and should also be shared \ncollectively with others. \nBut while he follows the natural course, he should also try, side by side, to develop Love, so \nthat, in course of time, Love would prevail, and lust would go for good. Thus mental control \ncan be achieved without depending on physical means. \nIf the physical means of birth control are ruled out as spiritually undesirable, the only \nalternative to regulate births of children is to rely on mental control. Complete mental \ncontrol is achieved by very few persons; and failure in mental control seems to affect \nwomen more seriously than men. For any such failures, women may have to undertake the \ntroubles and responsibility of bearing and rearing children, whereas man remains free from \nany such troubles or responsibility. Exclusive reliance upon mental control, therefore, \nseems to be unfair from the woman's point of view; and the use of physical means avoids \nthis injustice. \nThe injustice is not real, but only apparent. It is true that the woman has to undertake the \ntrouble and the responsibility of bearing and rearing children, but she also has the \ncompensating joy of feeding and fondling them. The joy of motherhood is much greater than \nthe joy of fatherhood. Further, the man also has to face and share his responsibility towards \nthe children. \nIn average cases, the general responsibility (economical, educational, etc.) of the father is \nmuch greater than that of the mother. Cases where the mother alone can adequately \ndischarge parental responsibility are extremely rare. Therefore, even in the event of failure \nin mental control, there need not be any injustice in the distribution of parental \nresponsibility, which should be mutually shared by man as well as woman. \nIn some cases, man is likely to be inconsiderate, since his eventual moral responsibility \ntowards the children is capable of being shirked. Woman is not likely to be thus \ninconsiderate, since she cannot avoid the physical consequences and the corresponding \nresponsibility. Why then should woman cooperate with man in this unequal enterprise? \nInconsiderateness is not necessary in this situation; and it can be avoided if the father as \nwell as the mother are both fully conscious of their mutual responsibility. Since they are \njoined together by spiritual links, they should cooperatively endeavour to attain mental \ncontrol; and in the event of any failure in mental control, they should cheerfully and \nwillingly discharge the joint responsibility of parenthood. But reliance on physical means is \ndisastrous to both from the spiritual point of view. \n(end of article) \n\"One day a man from Khorasan and a companion came there to see Baba. He said that for \nfourteen years he had practised asceticism in the Himalayas, and he had eaten the leaves \nand the fruits of the trees, and had meditated there, and he had just come back to the world. \nHe had come to Baba to ask whether he should marry or not. \n\"Baba said, 'If you want to marry, then go ahead and marry.' \n\"Baba told us to look at this man, that after fourteen years of asceticism, he had come back, \nand what does he want? He wants the world and he wants a wife.\" \nShahriar Mehrabanpur, \nRD p584 (1931?) \n\"The topic of celibacy came up again during Baba's private interview with Dick and Audrey \nInce. Meredith Starr had told the Inces that sex was only for procreation of children, and \nthey were not to have any sexual intercourse whatsoever. They followed this advice for \nsome time, but the marriage was breaking up because of it. When they told Baba, he refuted \nMeredith's claim, and told them that when married, one should lead a normal married life.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM5 p1566 \n(April 1932, London) \nQ. Why was Jesus not married? \nBaba: Every Avatar adopts a particular aspect of his time. He adapts and embodies his mode \nof working according to the attitudes of the people. The outstanding weakness that marked \nthe attitude of people in the time of Jesus was pomp, cruelty and pride. And to do away with \nthat and set an example, he based his working or mode of life on simplicity, humility and \nsuffering. And so there was no necessity for him to marry.* \n\"In the time of Muhammad, lust dominated in the minds of men, so much so that nearly \nevery man used to have sex with several women. Muhammad, marking this point, made it \nlawful for every follower of his to have only a certain number of wives, and himself married \nseven. Had he, like Jesus, not married, then it would have been deemed essential to make it \nlawful for his followers to remain unmarried. But nobody, in that case, would have followed \nhim. It would have been even worse than useless to come to nil from numerous, so he fixed \nthe number to seven from scores. \n\"The people were too much steeped in materialism in the age of Buddha. Therefore, \nstressing the nothingness of maya, he set an example of true renunciation, and left his wife \nand children. He founded his system on renunciation and sanyas. \n\"Dry atmosphere marked the age of Krishna. The predominating elements then were \ninternal strife, jealousy, greed. So he preached and founded his teachings on the gospel of \nlove and gaiety, so that people began learning lessons in and developing love and \nmerriment. \n\"The hopelessness of the situation in Zoroaster's time, when people progressed neither \nmaterially nor spiritually, made him base his system so as to make them live the life of the \nworld, yet be spiritually inclined, in search of God and Truth. He enacted certain laws, and \nmade it incumbent on his every follower not to marry more than one woman, and not to \nregard any other with a lustful eye. He founded his religion on the tenets of good thoughts, \ngood words, good deeds. \n\"In reality, all these Avatars were the manifestations of the same one divinity, void of \ndesires and above lust, greed, anger.\" \n29 June 1934, London, A p22-23 \nOther versions: Tr 174-175, \nMJ 2:6 p354-355, HM p443, \nQM p34-36, LM6 p1882 \n*Another version \n\"At the time of Jesus, arrogance, imperiousness, pride, cruelty were the characteristics of \nthe people. Nevertheless they possessed a conception of justice regarding women and \nmarriage, and it was not necessary, as it was in Arabia, to make marriage an example. Jesus \nlived the life of humility, simplicity and poverty, and he endured suffering in order to direct \nhumanity towards the purest ideal - God.\" \nQM p36 \n\"The original human form was never formed to beget children. This tendency among people \nto cohabit is nothing but animal instinct inherited from all the previous lives of evolution \nfrom the stone to the animal to the human form.\" \nMeher Baba, 18 October 1935, \nTiger Valley, LM6 p1977 \nAt the celebration of Meher Baba's 43rd birthday, on the second day, after everyone had \ntaken darshan and garlanded Baba with flowers, Baba's mother Shireen talked with him. \nBaba spoke with her via the alphabet board. \nShireen: Merwan, now you are worshiped as God on Earth. Since I am your mother, I should \nalso be respected. And I tell you now that there is only one thing left I want in this world: \nyou must get married. \nBaba: (laughing) \"What you say is perfectly true, mother. You are on the same level with \nMary the mother of Jesus, with Yeshoda the mother of Krishna. You must be respected, and \nyou too will one day be worshiped, as it was through your womb that God has taken birth. \n\"As your son, I would never disobey you. Of course I respect your wishes. However, in order \nto get married, there must be a man and a woman. What am I to do? God has put me into \nsuch a state that I do not find anyone else in the world but me. I experience myself to be in \nall. \n\"When a man goes to a cinema and watches a movie of a beautiful actress on the screen, can \nhe marry her? No, because she is only a a two-dimensional image on the screen. Likewise, I \nsee you all on the screen of Maya. How then can I get married?\" \nShireen wept. \n18 February 1937, Nasik, \nLM6 p2110-2111 \nA number of people had come to see Meher Baba, and were standing in line. One young man \nin the line was weeping. When he came before Baba, Baba looked into his eyes and asked, \n\"Did you carry out all my orders?' The man did not answer. Baba spelled out on the board, \n\"An order is much more important than any amount of spiritual longing, or gifts of \nthousands of rupees. \n\"There are seven colors of sanskaras. Red is the worst and the deepest. It is the most lasting \nimpression, and takes the longest to be wiped out. These red sanskaras are caused by the \nsex act, hence they are a great check on the progress and advancement. The sex act is \nconsidered a grave sin on the Path, and prohibited to spiritual aspirants. \n\"Thoughts of sexual desire may come, and even a rush of impulses, but one should not \ncommit any action with another person. Even masturbation is better, though it is harmful to \nthe physique. Sexual intercourse has the worst consequences. It attracts to oneself the \nworst sanskaras of ages past of one's partner, hence it is most difficult to wipe out. It incurs \nimmense ineradicable damage to one's spiritual progress.\" \nMeher Baba, 21 December 1937, \nBombay, LM7 p2249 \n\"When I had first joined Baba at the ashram in  Bangalore, I was not physically at my best, \nand I was emotionally drained from working with the children at school. I knew that being \nwith Baba and staying in the ashram would again lift me - just being with him was enough. \nThen, two days after I arrived, he called me for our first private talk. Baba communicated \nwith gestures for his general needs, but when he wanted to have a conversation or say \nsomething specific, he used an alphabet board. Although many of his gestures were easy to \nunderstand, I could read the board only very slowly. \n\"Being alone with Baba was unusual in itself, but I was completely unprepared for what he \nspelled out on the board: 'Would you like to marry?' \n\"I replied, 'No, Baba, I don't want to marry, because I want to love and serve only you!' \n\"Baba then said, 'To love me and serve me is great, but to obey me is the greatest. So will \nyou obey me and do what I tell you?' \n\"I replied, 'Yes, Baba.' \n\"He asked, 'If I tell you to, will you marry?' \n\"Growing uneasy, but having no choice, I again said yes to Baba. \n\"He then asked me, 'Do you know the story of Mira?' \nI told Baba I knew a little about her. \n\"Baba said, 'Mira did not wish to marry because she wanted only to love Krishna and to \nrenounce the world. But because Krishna told her to marry, she did. So likewise, will you \nmarry if I want you to?' \n\"With downcast eyes, I said, 'Yes, Baba.' \n\"Baba then said to me, 'Will you marry the man I tell you to marry? Suppose I tell you to \nmarry Nariman. Will you marry him?' \n\"In obedience, I said, 'Yes, Baba,' even though in my heart of hearts I wanted to live a single \nlife devoted only to him. \n\"Then, to comfort me, because he knew what anguish his questions were putting me \nthrough, Baba ended our conversation, saying, 'I'm not going to tell you to marry. I was just \nasking you.' \n\"... In this way beloved Baba eased my heart, as he knew I wasn't yet ready to accept the idea \nof being married; he gave me the time I needed to adjust to that possibility.\" \nArnavaz Dadachanji, \nGO p60-61 (May 1939?) \n(Arnavaz and Nariman Dadachanji were married December 21, 1944. Baba came to \nAhmednagar and gave darshan to all the wedding guests. They were together for about \nthirty years, until Nariman's death in 1974. It was apparently a very happy marriage.) \nBaba: When Nilu first came to me, I inquired about him getting married. He wanted to \nmarry, and if I had prevented him, it would not have been taken so well. So I made a plan \nand sent him, accordingly, with Kaku and my mother Shireen to Poona to see a nice girl. \nThere, in fact, Shireen and Kaku showed Nilu several girls, and so it happened that the girls \nhe liked did not like him, and those he did not like, liked him. Thus after his rambles he \nreturned to Meherabad and told me, 'Baba, I don't want to marry.' I wanted him to say this, \nand it happened according to my plan, as I turned my key. But if I had objected at the \nbeginning, although he would have obeyed me, the desire to marry would still have been \nburning there. (to Nilu) Is this true or false? \nNilu: Quite true. No one else in the world could have played such a perfect game. \nJuly? 1945, Hyderabad, LM8 p3051 \n\"The physical body is nothing but the Gross form of impressions. The Mental impression in \nthe mind of the male parent first takes a Subtle form, which then is released in the Gross \nform of mating. The mass of sanskaras or impressions thus released ultimately reaches the \nmind of the female parent, and it is from the mind of the female parent that the process of \nphysical incarnation starts. The soul which is awaiting reincarnation in the Gross body can \ndescend only if, during the process of sanskaric or impressional exchange between the male \nand female, their minds have come as near to stopping as possible. \n\"The physical body is produced by the working of many impressions, and it is the result of \ntheir very embodiment. It is therefore no wonder that it has a tendency to bind the soul \nwhich inhabits it. Love for the physical body is only a form of deep ignorance. The swine \ndelight in the refuse - so do the ignorant ones take delight in the body... \n\"Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because \ntherein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more \nsusceptible to lust and anger. Sometimes innumerable strong impressions are transmitted \nthrough the mere touch of the physical body of another person. A Gross body, even a corpse, \ncan quickly impart numberless impressions to the person who touches it. Sex contact \noutside wedlock is the worst form of exposure to heavy and binding impressions of lust. In \nwedlock the impressions exchanged are much lighter and less binding.\" \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, \nbefore 1948, ST p23-27 \nIn 1945 Nana Kher asked Meher Baba whether he should marry or remain single. Baba told \nhim he would instruct him after two years. \nIn Madras in April, 1947, Baba brought up the subject and told Nana Kher, \n\"If you want to marry, then marry. I give you my permission and blessings.\" \nNana told Baba, \"Never.\" \nBaba replied, \"Then why don't you marry me? If you have sexual thoughts, don't worry. But \ndo not put these thoughts into action.\" \nApril 1945, Madras. LM9 p3160 \nIn 1948 a young woman from  Poona wrote to Meher Baba and asked him to free her from \nthe fetters that bound her to the mayavic world. She also asked to meet him. He invited her \nto visit him in Ahmednagar in May, 1948. Afterwards she read all she could about Baba and \nhis teachings, her favorite being the reading meditation 'The Divine Theme.' She began to \nfeel sometimes a divine brilliance that enveloped objects around her. She wrote Baba, \n'Father, I feel the presence of God, but how will I see him?' When this was read out to Baba, \nhe looked pleased and gestured, 'A lucky one.' \nLater she wrote, 'Is it necessary for a girl to marry when she finds the marriage is based \nmore on money than on pure love? Can she not live alone and lead a pure life, relying on the \ngrace of the Master? Can a girl get Self-realisation?' \nIn another letter, the girl wrote, 'Dear Baba, sometimes I get such a strong feeling that I \nshould leave my home and go to some quiet place for meditation. Would that be good? But \nat the same time I remember your words, \"Be in the world, but not of it,\" and I stay back.' \nBaba replied to her letters through Adi K. Irani: \n\"Baba says that a married life strictly in adherence to one's partner is not bad; but a single \nlife, with the grace of the Master, replete with aspirations Godward, is infinitely better... \nBaba told me to inform you that constant remembrance of the one whom you consider to be \nyour Master will go a long way toward lessening the mental tension and bringing about \npeace of mind.

It is only by living in the world, and trying to develop as \ndetached an outlook on life as possible, that you will gain equipoise and make real \nprogress... \n\"Baba desires you to remember him always, in good times and in bad times, and thereby \nincrease your faith in him, which alone will make you impervious to the ups and downs of \nlife...

Much 'religious' \nsentiment is also ushered into the discussion of this subject, both by the advocates and the \nopponents of this movement. \nEach leader or person in the public eye whose opinion has been sought, has considered the \nquestion from his or her own angle of vision or sphere of activity, e.g. social, medical or \nreligious; and as a Spiritual Master and the author of a spiritual movement, Shri Meher \nBaba's views are solicited on this point. His opinion, based as it is on spiritual \nconsiderations, is above everything. He does not consider the question from the point of \nview of any special or limited interest, but from the point of view of the ultimate and \ncomplete well-being of the individual and the society, for, as he has repeatedly said, \n'Spirituality includes everything.' \nThe present day birth control movement can be analysed into two parts: 1) its aim, and 2) \nits means. It aims at regulating the birth of children for a) eugenic, b) economic, or c) \npersonal reasons. \nUncontrolled breeding leads to the birth of diseased and weak issue, intensifies the acute \n'struggle for existence' and all the political and economical problems (e.g. crimes, wars and \npoverty), which are the inevitable outcome of ruthless competition, and often creates for \nparents a responsibility which they cannot adequately discharge. All these considerations \nare humane and rational, and therefore demand and justify serious attempts to regulate \nbreeding. \nThe purely physical means, however, which the enthusiastic supporters of the birth control \nmovement advocate, are found to lead to the following undesirable results: \n1. While the wealthier and the middle classes, who can afford to support many issue in their \nfamilies, have already taken to this mania of using contraceptives, the really poor and the \ndestitute, who cannot at all afford to breed children, either do not know enough about \ncontraceptives, or deliberately neglect to use them. And the result is that the uneducated \nmasses are multiplying as ever, and the educated and the rich classes are becoming thinner; \nand in the actual result of the use of contraceptives, the very purpose of securing children \nonly when and where they would be properly looked after, is defeated by the means. \n2. Further, the contraceptives, which are advocated on humanitarian grounds, are generally \nused by the majority of the people for serving their own selfish ends, and for avoiding the \nresponsibility of bearing and bringing up children. \n3. Since the physical consequences of the sex act can be so successfully avoided through the \nuse of chemical and physical means, those who have not yet begun to be awake to the \nhigher values have no incentive to be moderate in the gratification of passion; and they \ntherefore become victims to excessive indulgence in the satisfaction of sex desire, which has \ndisastrous physical, moral and spiritual consequences. Since the advocates of the birth \ncontrol movement are content to emphasise the need of the use of physical means only, and \nentirely neglect the spiritual side of the question, the younger generation is likely to become \nblind to the need for mental control, and might bring about its on ruin by becoming a slave \nto the animal passion. \nWhat then is the alternative? The easy physical means of avoiding issue are far from being \ncontributory to the awakening of man to his real dignity and freedom as a spiritual being. \nThoughtless and uncontrolled indulgence must inevitably lead to reaction and spiritual \nbondage. Only through the wise exercise of mental control is it possible for man to rise from \npassion to peace, from bondage to freedom, from animality to purity. \nFor spiritual aspirants in particular, and also for all human beings (because they are all \npotentially spiritual aspirants), it is extremely inadvisable to rely upon purely physical \nmeans for the regular breeding. They must rely upon mental control, which will \nautomatically result in the regulation of births. They can thus equally well achieve the \nhumanitarian purposes of the birth control movement, without incurring upon themselves \nthe spiritual disasters which must overtake them if they merely rely on the purely physical \nmeans advocated by the supporters of the movement. \nShri Meher Baba, therefore, throws light upon the much ignored spiritual side of the \nquestion, and advocates mental control, which is not only useful for regulating the number \nof children, but is also indispensible for restoring to man his divine dignity and spiritual \ngood, viz. peace, happiness and freedom. \nThe use of physical means for preventing the birth of children without mental control is \nspiritually disastrous for an aspirant. But is it permissible for an aspirant to use, in \nincreasing degree, mental control along with the physical means, if he considers that he \ncannot undertake the responsibility of children, and if he does not in any way slacken his \nattempts at mental control and sublimation, and if he sincerely uses the physical means \nprovisionally, and intends to give them up as soon as possible? \nBirth control must be, essentially, self-control (mental control) and nothing else. There \nshould be no second aid to it. And physical means, under no circumstances, considerations \nor conditions, would be advisable. \nIf one is not prepared to undertake the responsibility of children, there is only one course \nleft for him. He must remain a bachelor - a true bachelor in the real sense of the word. For \nmental control, although extremely difficult in practise, is not impossible. \nBut in trying to utilise any means other than mental, even with the motive of developing the \nmental through the physical, one does not attain self-control, much as he desires it. On the \ncontrary, being addicted to the physical means, he tries to justify himself all the more in the \nutilising of the physical means, and becomes a victim to the habit, rather than effecting a \ndevelopment in self-control. \nTo explain it still more clearly, what happens in the use of physical means, is that while one \nthinks that he is using them as a preliminary step before the mental control is fully \ndeveloped, he actually gets addicted to them, and becomes a slave of the habit of using \nthem. And though he may remain under the delusion that he is trying to develop mental \ncontrol through the physical means, he is, in reality, all the while, losing gradually. \nIn short, mental power is undermined by reliance on the physical means. Therefore the \nchances of one's developing self-control through physical means are absolutely remote. On \nthe contrary, there is always the risk of being a prey to the animal passion, and hence \nphysical means are under no conditions advisable, even from the best of motives. \nPreventing birth of children through physical means is most disastrous from the spiritual \npoint of view, and is positively detrimental to the development of self-control. \nAs a Spiritual Master, Shri Meher Baba would advise strict celibacy, but it is extremely \ndifficult, though not impossible. Hence, very few practise it. And so, for others who cannot \nobserve strict celibacy, the next best course, he would advise, is to marry, rather than \nremain a bachelor and fly like a bee from flower to flower. If in marriage one learns to \ncontrol animal passion, well and good. If he cannot control it, he must let nature take its \nown course (rather than use any unnatural means) and bear the consequences of \nshouldering the responsibility for upbringing of the children, and even suffer for that. This \nresponsibility must be accepted individually, and should also be shared collectively with \nothers. But while he follows the natural course, he should also try, side by side, to develop \nLove, so that, in course of time, Love would prevail, and lust would go for good. Thus mental \ncontrol can be achieved without depending on physical means. \nIf the physical means of birth control are ruled out as spiritually undesirable, the only \nalternative to regulate births of children is to rely on mental control. Complete mental \ncontrol is achieved by very few persons; and failure in mental control seems to affect \nwomen more seriously than men. For any such failures, women may have to undertake the \ntroubles and responsibility of bearing and rearing children, whereas man remains free from \nany such troubles or responsibility. Exclusive reliance upon mental control, therefore, \nseems to be unfair from the woman's point of view; and the use of physical means avoids \nthis injustice. \nThe injustice is not real, but only apparent. It is true that the woman has to undertake the \ntrouble and the responsibility of bearing and rearing children, but she also has the \ncompensating joy of feeding and fondling them. The joy of motherhood is much greater than \nthe joy of fatherhood. Further, the man also has to face and share his responsibility towards \nthe children. \nIn average cases, the general responsibility (economical, educational, etc.) of the father is \nmuch greater than that of the mother. Cases where the mother alone can adequately \ndischarge parental responsibility are extremely rare. Therefore, even in the event of failure \nin mental control, there need not be any injustice in the distribution of parental \nresponsibility, which should be mutually shared by man as well as woman. \nIn some cases, man is likely to be inconsiderate, since his eventual moral responsibility \ntowards the children is capable of being shirked. Woman is not likely to be thus \ninconsiderate, since she cannot avoid the physical consequences and the corresponding \nresponsibility. Why then should woman cooperate with man in this unequal enterprise? \nInconsiderateness is not necessary in this situation; and it can be avoided if the father as \nwell as the mother are both fully conscious of their mutual responsibility. Since they are \njoined together by spiritual links, they should cooperatively endeavour to attain mental \ncontrol; and in the event of any failure in mental control, they should cheerfully and \nwillingly discharge the joint responsibility of parenthood. But reliance on physical means is \ndisastrous to both from the spiritual point of view. \n(end of article) \n(No author named) \nQ. They say that woman is a drag on man in his attainment of divine grace. All the saints you \nsee... \nBaba: No, woman can play an important part in the development of divine grace. She is \nman's equal. So long as she is true to herself, all will be well. But when once she surrenders \nto her surroundings, you understand, the function of marriage fails. It is then you have \ndivorces. \nQ. Then the vow of celibacy which the saints undertook... \nBaba: It is unimportant. Some men marry, others may remain single, but a man is not \nspiritually more backward because he has married. A woman by her love can inspire him to \nknow the truth. But she must develop love and not lust. This is the key to happiness. \nApril 1932, London, to a reporter for the \nLondon Daily Sketch, BG p128-129 \nAnother version: LM5 p1565 \n\"Even the love which expresses through physical desire is good to the extent that it frees \none from the thralldom of personal likes and dislikes, and makes one want to serve the \nbeloved above all other things. \n\"Every human relationship is based on love in one form or another, and endures or \ndissolves as that love is eternal or temporal in character. Marriage, for example, is happy or \nunhappy, exalting or degrading, lasting or fleeting, according to the love which inspires and \nsustains it. \n\"Marriages based on sex-attraction alone cannot endure. They lead inevitably to divorce or \nworse. Marriages, on the other hand, which are based on a mutual desire to serve and \ninspire, grow continually in richness and beauty, and are a benediction to all who know of \nthem.\" \nMeher Baba, 1 June 1932 \nBeverly Hills, California, Me p100 \nQ. When a young aspirant meets young women he is susceptible to thoughts of lust. On the \nother hand, if he avoids them entirely, he is likely to withhold a great deal of love. Is there \nany way out of this difficulty? \nBaba:  Free mixing of the sexes, as in the West, is on the whole good. But if the aspirant feels \nwithin his mind the slightest flutter of impure thoughts, he should stand aside. But he must \nlove, and in order to avoid the arising of impure thoughts, he should keep in mind the \nthought that in the other person he is loving the Master. \nQ. The aspirant must, undoubtedly, eliminate lust and release love. But lust as well as love \nare facts of inner life, that is, modes of consciousness, and cannot be taken as being identical \nwith any specific acts of the physical body. Will the aspirant be wrong if he tries to express \nand develop love, instead of lust, through sex union? \nBaba: If the aspirant thinks that through the sex-act he is expressing love, he is, sadly, \nmistaken. It is lust which prompts him to it. It is not possible to express pure love through \nthe sex-act, because of the clash of impressions involved therein. \nQ. What is your teaching concerning marriage? \nBaba: For an aspirant, celibacy is better than marriage. But if he cannot control himself, he \nshould marry. To pursue a spiritual life, it is much better to marry than to go from flower to \nflower. \nQ. How can the aspirant use marriage for spiritual progress? \nBaba: In the beginning, the aspirant will, in relation to the partner, feel lust as well as love. \nBut he can, with conscious and deliberate cooperation with the partner, gradually lessen the \nelement of lust and increase the element of love, until love becomes utterly pure and free \nfrom lust. But in order to achieve this purpose, he must strictly limit himself to his partner \nin matters of sex. \n1930s, A p50-51 \n\"The topic of celibacy came up again during Baba's private interview with Dick and Audrey \nInce. Meredith Starr had told the Inces that sex was only for procreation of children, and \nthey were not to have any sexual intercourse whatsoever. They followed this advice for \nsome time, but the marriage was breaking up because of it. When they told Baba, he refuted \nMeredith's claim, and told them that when married, one should lead a normal married life.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, LM5 p1566 (April 1932, London) \nA woman told Baba that, because of her desire to see God, she wanted to stop having sex \nwith her husband. Her husband did not agree. Baba told her, \n\"It is better to treat your husband with love and affection, even if you dislike and do not \nwish to indulge in intercourse because of your spiritual aspiration and desire to love God. \n\"It is good to have no sexual desires, but when it comes to a question of duty, you must \nsacrifice a little of your interest to please your husband. \n\"Keep your mind focused toward God, and give your body to your husband. Remember \nSaint Mira's sacrifice and how she suffered. Be like her.\" \nMeher Baba, 28 October 1934 \nMeherabad, LM6 p1919 \n\"The original human form was never formed to beget children. This tendency among people \nto cohabit is nothing but animal instinct inherited from all the previous lives of evolution \nfrom the stone to the animal to the human form.\" \nMeher Baba, 18 October 1935 \nTiger Valley, LM6 p1977 \n\"One evening Norina awakened to find Baba outside her window. 'Tell me your dream,' he \nasked. Norina hesitated, embarassed because it had been a vivid sexual dream. At last, she \ndid. Baba indicated to her not to worry about it, and remarked, 'Even on the sixth plane, one \nstill has lust.'\" \nJanuary 1937? Nasik, LM6 p2080 \n\"Self has no sex. But when self treats itself as the body, the illusion of sex appears, and \ntherefore, duality. The self in each of us is sexless, but the self in a person thinks itself as a \nwoman, and in another thinks itself as a man. This is delusion... It all comes from thinking of \nourselves as the body.\" \nMeher Baba, 9 February 1937 \nNakik, LM6 p2093 \nIn August, 1937, at  Cannes, France, Meher Baba told some of his Western followers about \n\"the work I wish to do for the world involving the minimizing of lust, and especially to \ndestroy that lust of homosexuals which is now prevailing to an alarming extent all over the \nworld.\" \nLM6 p2213 \nA number of people had come to see Meher Baba, and were standing in line. One young man \nin the line was weeping. When he came before Baba, Baba looked into his eyes and asked, \n\"Did you carry out all my orders?' \nThe man did not answer. Baba spelled out on the board, \n\"An order is much more important than any amount of spiritual longing, or gifts of \nthousands of rupees. \n\"There are seven colors of sanskaras. Red is the worst and the deepest. It is the most lasting \nimpression, and takes the longest to be wiped out. These red sanskaras are caused by the \nsex act, hence they are a great check on the progress and advancement. The sex act is \nconsidered a grave sin on the Path, and prohibited to spiritual aspirants. \n\"Thoughts of sexual desire may come, and even a rush of impulses, but one should not \ncommit any action with another person. Even masturbation is better, though it is harmful to \nthe physique. Sexual intercourse has the worst consequences. It attracts to oneself the \nworst sanskaras of ages past of one's partner, hence it is most difficult to wipe out. It incurs \nimmense ineradicable damage to one's spiritual progress.\" \nMeher Baba, 21 December 1937 \nBombay, LM7 p2249 \n\"The world is accustomed to think in terms of opposites. Thus, we often try to fit life into a \nscheme of alternatives, such as joy or pain, attachment or repulsion, good or bad, solitude or \ncompany, indulgence or repression. And in the same way the mind has a tendency to think \nof marriage and celibacy as alternatives from which there is no escape. \n\"It seems as if man must accept one alternative or the other. And yet he cannot \nwholeheartedly accept either alternative, because when he is celibate, he is dissatisfied with \nhis lot, and longingly thinks of the advantages of marriage. And when he is married, he is \nequally dissatisfied with his lot, and longingly thinks of the advantages of celibacy. Thus, in \noscillating from one idea to the other, mind finds no rest. \n\"In order to be freed from the clutches of the opposites, the mind must first try to \nunderstand how they are both equally the creation of imagination working under the \ndeluding influence of craving. In celibacy as well as in marriage, craving is present. Celibacy \nas opposed to marriage means the mechanical restraint or the repression of sex, whereas \nmarriage means the release or the indulgence of sex. But both presuppose the crowding of \nthe mind by the sanskaras of lust, or the craving for sensation. Craving is therefore the \ncommon root of both the opposites of celibacy and marriage. \n\"The mind which is restless with desire creates an illusory idea of happiness in the \ngratification of desire, and then, knowing that the soul remains dissatisfied even after \ngratification, it creates an illusory idea of happiness in the mechanical restraint of desire. In \nsearch of freedom and happiness, the mind gets caught up within these opposites, which it \nfinds equally disappointing. And since it does not try to go beyond the opposites, its \nmovement is always from one opposite to the other, and consequently from one \ndisappointment to another disappointment. \n\"Craving thus falsifies the operation of the imagination, and presents the mind with the \noption between two opposites which prove to be equally deceptive in their promise of \nhappiness. However, in spite of alternate and repeated experience of disappointment in \nboth the opposites, the mind usually does not renounce craving. Because while experiencing \ndisappointment in mechanical restraint, it is easily susceptible to the false promise of \ngratification. And while experiencing disappointment in indulgence, it is easily susceptible \nto the false promise of mechanical restraint. \n\"It is only when the mind is awakened by the grace of a Master that it begins internal and \nspontaneous renunciation of craving, which in the course of time leads to abiding peace and \nhappiness. Internal and spontaneous renunciation of craving is as different from mechanical \nrestraint as it is from indulgence. Mind turns to mechanical restraint because of \ndisappointment. But it turns to internal and spontaneous renunciation because of \ndisillusionment or awakening, which comes when it experiences in the Master the quality of \nlife which is free from craving, and which, therefore, is not bound by the deceptive \nopposites. \n\"When the mind, through awakening, once begins to tread the path of internal and \nspontaneous renunciation of craving, it ceases to think in terms of the opposites of \nmechanical restraint and indulgence, celibacy and marriage. It is no longer moved by the \nfalse promises of the opposites, but is drawn by the longing for the Truth which increasingly \ncomes within its ken as it disburdens itself of craving. Then the aspirant does not worry \nabout celibacy or marriage. Hankering for neither, he cheerfully accepts the conditions \nwhich life has brought to him; and whether in celibacy or marriage, he begins internal and \nspontaneous renunciation of craving, until he is freed from the opposites and lives a life in \nwhich the value of both are mysteriously combined. \n\"The life of Perfection may be described as the life of celibacy in marriage, or marriage in \ncelibacy, according to the differences in the starting point of the aspirant and the external \nconditions of his life. The path of Perfection is open to the aspirant whether in celibacy or in \nmarriage; and whether he begins from celibacy or from marriage will depend upon the \nsanskaras and the karmic ties of the aspirant. But the path as well as the goal are the same \nas far as the inner life is concerned. The paradoxical expression 'celibacy in marriage' or \n'marriage in celibacy' is appropriate for the final stage of Perfection or the attainment of the \ngoal, and not for the state when the aspirant is on the Path. \n\"This state (celibacy in marriage, or marriage in celibacy) must be sharply distinguished \nfrom any haphazard and cheap compromise between celibacy and marriage. It is utterly \ndifferent from such a compromise, which inevitably must land the aspirant in the most \npitiful and dangerous chaos of promiscuity, where the values of celibacy as well as marriage \ncome to be destroyed; for the path of inner and spontaneous renunciation is, in such \ncompromise, necessarily beset with insuperable difficulties. \n\"Promiscuity (which is an attempt to find a compromise between celibacy and marriage) is \na case of dissipating and rapid alternation between the opposites. But celibacy in marriage, \nor marriage in celibacy, is a state of freedom from the opposites; and this state combines the \nvalues of celibacy as well as marriage. \n\"The value of celibacy lies, not in the mechanical restraint, but in the sense of independence \nwhich it gives. But as long as the mind is not altogether free from craving, there is no true \nfreedom. In the same way, the value of marriage lies not in indulgence, but in the sense of \nunity with the other which it gives. But true union, or the dissolution of duality, is possible \nonly through divine love, which can never dawn as long as there is in the mind the slightest \nshadow of lust or craving. \n\"Only by treading the path of inner and spontaneous renunciation of craving is it possible to \nattain true freedom and union with life, where the duality of the I and you is swallowed up \nin the all-embracing divine love, and where there is neither the mechanical restraint of \ncelibacy, nor the indulgence of marriage, but complete detachment and perfect love. \n\"This state of Perfection, in which the Master continuously dwells, may be aptly described \nas celibacy in marriage or marriage in celibacy. For while he is freed from ignorance, he is \nunited with God, and while he knows himself to be the single one, he also knows himself to \nbe the one with all. And while he may be said to be a celibate in relation to Maya, he may be \nsaid to have been married to Truth. \nMeher Baba, 1930s? NW p74-78 \nNote: There is some overlap between this discourse (above) and the one printed in \nDiscourses under the title 'The Problem of Sex,' part of which is reprinted immediately \nbelow. The one above seems to be the  earlier of the two. \n\"The question of indulgence or repression arises only when there is craving. The need for \nboth vanishes along with the complete disappearance of craving. When the mind is free \nfrom craving, the mind can no more be moved by the false promises of indulgence or \nmechanical repression. However, it should be borne in mind that the life of freedom is \nnearer to the life of restraint than to the life of indulgence, though in quality is is essentially \ndifferent from both. Hence, for the aspirant, a life of strict celibacy is preferable to the \nmarried life, if restraint comes to him easily, without any undue sense of self-repression. \nBut such restraint is, for most persons, difficult, and sometimes impossible, and for them the \nmarried life is decidedly more helpful than a life of celibacy. For ordinary persons, married \nlife is undoubtably advisable unless they have a special aptitude for celibacy... \n\"Most persons enter into married life as a matter of course. But marriage will turn into a \nhelp or a hindrance according to the manner in which it is handled. There is no doubt that \nsome of the immense spiritual possibilities are accessible through a married life, but all this \ndepends upon having the right attitude. From the spiritual point of view, married life will be \na success only if it is thoroughly determined by the vision of Truth. It cannot offer much if it \nis based upon nothing more than the limited motives of mere sex, or if it is inspired by \nconsiderations which usually obtain in the partnership of business. It has to be taken as a \nreal spiritual enterprise which is intended to discover what life can be at its best. When the \ntwo partners together launch upon the spiritual adventure of exploring the higher \npossibilities of the spirit, they cannot at the outset limit their experiment by any nice \ncalculations concerning the nature and amount of individual gain... \n\"For the celibate as well as for the married person, the path of inner life is the same. When \nthe aspirant is drawn by the Truth, he longs for nothing else. And as the Truth increasingly \ncomes within his ken, he gradually disburdens himself of craving. Whether in celibacy or in \nmarriage, he is no longer swayed by the deceptive promises of indulgence or mechanical \nrepression, and he practises internal and spontaneous renunciation of craving until he is \nfreed from the deceptive opposites. \n\"The path of Perfection is open to the aspirant whether in celibacy or in marriage. And \nwhether he begins from celibacy or from marriage will depend upon the sanskaras and the \nkarmic ties of the aspirant. He cheerfully accepts the conditions which his past life has \ndetermined for him, and utilises them towards his spiritual advancement in the light of the \nideal which he has come to perceive... \n\"If a person is not prepared to undertake the responsibilities of children, there is only one \ncourse which is left for him. He must remain a celibate, and practise strict mental control. \nFor though such mental control is extremely difficult to attain, it is not impossible. From the \npurely spiritual point of view, strict celibacy is best. But since it is so difficult, few can \npractise it. And for those who cannot practise it, the next best course is to marry, rather \nthan fall a prey to promiscuity. \"Within married life one can learn to control animal passion. \nBut it is bound to be a gradual process, and in cases of failure in practising control, parents \nmust allow nature to take its own course, rather than interfere with it through artificial \nmeans. They must cheerfully welcome the consequences, and be prepared to shoulder the \nresponsibility for the upbringing of children... \n\"In the beginning of married life, the partners are drawn to each other by lust as well as \nlove. But they can, with conscious and deliberate cooperation, gradually lessen the element \nof lust and increase the element of love. Through this process of sublimation, lust ultimately \ngives place to deep love. By the mutual sharing of joys and sorrows, the partners march on \nfrom one spiritual triumph to another spiritual triumph, from deep love to ever deeper love, \ntill the possessive and jealous love of the initial period is entirely replaced by a self-giving \nand expansive love. In fact, through the intelligent handling of marriage, a person may \ntraverse so much of the spiritual Path that it needs only a touch by a Master to raise him \ninto the sanctuary of eternal life.\" \nMeher Baba, c.1940, Di v2 p3-13 \n\"If one is lustful, he has a tendency to fasten his lust upon several persons of the opposite \nsex. The ideal of brahmacharya (celibacy, sexlessness) does not allow even the touch of the \nperson of the opposite sex. \n\"Now if the Master, who is entirely free from lust, wants to help a strongly lustful person, he \nknows that the aspirant is incapable of brahmacharya. Therefore, he allows him to legally \nmarry, but he asks him to limit his lust only to one woman. \n\"Then gradually, as lust diminishes, he may be asked to give up all acts of lust, even with his \nwedded wife, although he can maintain and continue the married life. \n\"In this manner, lust is gradually eliminated, and the goal of brahmacharya is finally \nobtained.\" \nMeher Baba, 9 April 1942, Dehra Dun, LM8 p2788 \n\"The physical body is nothing but the Gross form of impressions. The Mental impression in \nthe mind of the male parent first takes a Subtle form, which then is released in the Gross \nform of mating. The mass of sanskaras or impressions thus released ultimately reaches the \nmind of the female parent, and it is from the mind of the female parent that the process of \nphysical incarnation starts. The soul which is awaiting reincarnation in the Gross body can \ndescend only if, during the process of sanskaric or impressional exchange between the male \nand female, their minds have come as near to stopping as possible. \n\"The physical body is produced by the working of many impressions, and it is the result of \ntheir very embodiment. It is therefore no wonder that it has a tendency to bind the soul \nwhich inhabits it. Love for the physical body is only a form of deep ignorance. The swine \ndelight in the refuse - so do the ignorant ones take delight in the body... \n\"Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because \ntherein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more \nsusceptible to lust and anger. Sometimes innumerable strong impressions are transmitted \nthrough the mere touch of the physical body of another person. A Gross body, even a corpse, \ncan quickly impart numberless impressions to the person who touches it. Sex contact \noutside wedlock is the worst form of exposure to heavy and binding impressions of lust. In \nwedlock the impressions exchanged are much lighter and less binding.\" \nfrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, before 1948, ST p23-27 \n\"To have one eye glued on the enchanting pleasures of the flesh, and with the other expect \nto see a spark of eternal bliss, is not only impossible, but the height of hypocrisy. \n\"I cannot expect you to understand all at once what I want you to know. It is for me to \nawaken you from time to time throughout the ages, sowing the seed in your limited minds, \nwhich must in due course and with proper heed and care on your part, germinate, flourish, \nand bear the fruit of that true knowledge which is inherently yours to gain. \n\"If, on the other hand, led by your ignorance, you persist in going your own way, none can \nstop you in your choice of progress. For that too is progress, which, however slow and \npainful, eventually, and after innumerable incarnations, is bound to make you realise that \nwhich I want you to know now. \n\"To save yourself from further entanglement in the maze of delusion and self-created \nsuffering, which owes its magnitude to the extent of your ignorance of the true goal, awake \nnow.  Pay heed and strive for freedom by experiencing ignorance in its true perspective. Be \nhonest with yourself and God. One may fool the world and one's neighbors, but one can \nnever escape from the knowledge of the omniscient - such is the divine law.\" \nMeher Baba, 7 September 1954 \nDehra Dun, Aw 2:1 p5 \n\"In the Beyond state of God, sex does not exist. There only one indivisible existence prevails. \nIt is in the realm of illusionary phenomena called the universe that sex asserts itself.\" \nMeher Baba, 3 March 1954, Kakinada, \nAndhra, AD p134-135 \n\"... Male and female human forms are rightly described as opposite sexes. Progressive \nrealisation of the adequate forms, the continuation of the species, and the onward march of \nthe incarnated lifestream are dependent upon the opposition and interplay of the sexes, \nparticularly at the higher phases of biological evolution. This is especially true of \npsychological and spiritual evolution as long as it is held up in the domain of illusion. The \nopposition of the sexes and the alternative attempts to overcome or reconcile this \nopposition are admittedly a source of inspiration, sublimation and exasperation, which \nhaunt the interplay of sex opposites at the psychic level until they are withstood or \nunderstood fully and adequately. \n\"One special feature of the sex opposites is that while remaining in counterbalancing \nopposition to each other, they are more patently and firmly tethered to each other than \nmany other opposites. A man who is conscious of himself as a male is at the same time \nconscious of woman as a female; and the tension of the felt duality is on him a constant \nburden, which he often invisibly passes on to a member of the opposite sex. The same is \ntrue of a woman who is particularly conscious of herself as a female. The opposites create \nand sustain a burdensome illusion which is transferred to each other. And if this illusion is \nshared by both, it goes on increasing in geometrical proportion instead of being mitigated in \nany way. \n\"On the other hand, the disburdening of the illusory and oppositional duality of sex is also a \nself-communicative understanding. Then love is gradually freed from the tinge of \ndifferentiative sex-consciousness, and understanding is lifted out of the obsessiveness of \none of the most oppressive forms of duality.\" \nMeher Baba, 1956? Be p62-64 \n\"... The oppressiveness of the sex-tinged relationship is more subtle than all the rest. It \npierces into the very being of the separatist soul, exploding it from within like a time bomb. \nBut it always flies off at a tangent to the other soul, and is stamped with a patent failure in \nsoul alchemy. \n\"Though sex-consciousness clasps its opposite with an outgoing fervor, it augments duality \ninstead of sublating it, and the soul continues to be arrested within the spell of the felt \n'other.' The invincible other is a constant companion of sex-driven consciousness, and is felt \nas the 'other.' \n\"In deepest fulfillment, the sex-tinged opposition suddenly brings to the surface an equally \ndeep frustration which is latent in itself. Even in its most refined and directed form, it does \nnot succeed in sublating duality. In fact, despite appearances to the contrary, it is perhaps \nthe most trenchant of the separatories which obtain in the confused psyche. At all psychic \nlevels, sex consciousness creates the sex opposites and their game of hide and seek, gain \nand loss, conquest and surrender, love and hate, frustration and fulfillment. At its best, it \nmay pierce the assertive separatism of the soul, but it is never able to relieve it. Its rare \nmoments of evanescent vanishment of separatism are always followed by its accentuation \nin a more formidable form. \n\"What sublates all forms of duality is untethered love. Untethered love neither allows you to \nfall back into a subjective vacuity, nor does it throw you at the mercy of the felt 'other.' It \nrelieves you from the harassing interplay of the felt duality of 'I' and 'you.' \n\"Among the psychic separatories which create and sustain the multicolored duality of 'I' and \n'you,' none is more formidable than that of the sex drive. The sex opposites, which are its \ncreations, find themselves helplessly caught up in the game of illusion, being unable to \nseparate from each other or really unite with each other. \n\"The multicolored interplay of souls and the variegated opposition of 'I' and 'you' persist \nuntil, through the grace of some enlightened one, the soul gets initiated into the untethered \nlove which is free from every tinge of duality. Prior to this relieving fulfillment, every soul \nhas to suffer the juxtaposition of 'I' and 'you' for countless lives. By the logic of the situation, \nevery soul is driven to gather experiences of both sexes, sometimes incarnating in the male \nform and sometimes in the female form. \n\"Sometimes tethered at one end of the trans-subjective opposition, and sometimes at the \nother end, the soul dramatises within its own psyche the interplay of soul opposites by \nwhom it is confronted until it gets established in the relief of non-differentiating and \nuntethered love. Such love alone can understand the 'I' as well as 'you' as being its own \nillusory creations, rising from itself and disappearing within itself to find the ineffable \nfulfillment of the eternal beyond.\" \nMeher Baba, 1956? Be p69-72 \n\"Lust means a craze. Some have the lust for power, some lust of the senses, etc. \n\"The whole creation came out of lust. The first whim was lustful. God had intercourse with \nhimself through the Om point, and the creation was the result of this act.\" \nMeher Baba, 1960, Poona, Aw 22:1 p40 \nFrom a talk by Eruch Jessawala: \n\"All that you have read in Meher Baba's books about sex is so clear and firm, indeed. We \nhave to strive to rise above sex and begin to love - love in the real sense. People have come \nhere from the West, and many, many times put questions to us about sex and love. And each \ntime I have responded by stating that Baba wants us to rise above sex, to transcend our sex \nimpulses and begin really to love. Yet so often, the question comes back, 'What are you \ntalking about? How can there be love without sex?' \n\"I can only reply, well, this is what I have gathered from all that Meher Baba has said on the \nsubject. We human beings are so often entrenched in our animality, however, so enmeshed \nin our carnal passions, that it has become quite natural to encounter and struggle with this \nproblem of sex. \n\"It is not that there is anything inherently wrong in our having sex impulses. It is simply \nthat, as sentient human beings, it behooves us to strive to live as ones who are blessed with \nthe capacity to recognise what love really is. \n\"Baba has explained to us that not only is the sex play of physical lovemaking the polar \nopposite of love in the truest sense, but that even the most exalted form of human love - the \nlove which an adoring mother feels for her child - is not really love at all, but only a high \ndegree of affection. Why? Because, Baba said, where there is any trace of satisfaction or \nexpectation, there is not love, but only one level or another of affection. \n\"With love, according to Baba, there can never be satisfaction, only the dissatisfaction of \nfeeling that one has not loved enough - only the longing to love more and more, with no \nconcern whatever for the reciprocation of love. Even with a mother's love, there is \nsatisfaction and expectation - satisfaction derived from both showing affection, and, in turn, \nreceiving it in response - and expectation that the 'love' which is showered upon the child \nwill be reciprocated. So it is that Baba has pointed out to us, and made us aware, that what \nwe commonly take to be love is not really love, in its true sense, at all. \n\"Baba once told me something sublime in relation to this subject of love. He explained that it \nis completely natural for a human being to fall in love. Why? Because as a human being, you \nhave been given a human form to enable you to love, to be loved, and to share love. \n\"It is for love itself, he said, that the whole creation sprang into existence. It was because I, \nBaba declared, being love, needed to be loved. Being the only one, the only being, the very \nis-ness of all existence, I had no other way to share love. \n\"Love, being love, needs to be shared. It must be shared! It needs to flow. It needs, in short, \nto love and be loved. This trait of give and take is innate in love. It is the very nature of love. \n\"Because God is love, Baba explained, there is nothing for love to do but to placate itself by \nplaying a game, a game of solitaire, so to speak. Everyone knows about the card game of \nsolitaire. When you are alone and you want to play cards, you can play a particular sort of \ncard game in which you establish an imaginary partnership to play the game. \n\"Describing how creation came into being, Baba said, I started playing the game called \nsolitaire. Being existence infinite, eternally and unendingly myself, I imagined a partner \nwith which I could share my love. Because that imagining emanated from existence infinite \neternal, it projected itself into being, into creation. Because I am existence, that imagination \nexisted. \n\"This then is the explanation which Baba gave for creation: to share his love. He also went \non to explain how, after passing through each of the evolutionary stages, the soul then \nfinally comes to inherit this human form. And he often emphasised how sublime this form is. \nIt is through this form alone that each soul one day recognises its true identity with the \nTruth; that it is, in fact omnipotent... in fact, omniscient.. in fact, all-bliss. In short, it is solely \nthrough this incredible human form that the soul realises its own infinitude, and ultimately \nrecognises and claims its birthright of its true identity as God himself. \n\"How does Baba characterise your experience at the moment when you realise your true \nself? Very simply, he says that the experience makes you realise what you already are. What \nis the point, then, of wasting this opportunity of a human lifetime on crazy notions of \nspirituality and spiritual advancement, which boil down to nothing more than seeking ways \nto realise what you already are? It is ridiculous, Baba says, absurd! You are that infinite one, \nand it is your birthright to realise who you already are. \n\"We are not meant to waste this precious, fleeting moment of life in pursuit of intellectual or \neven spiritual gymnastics. What this moment is meant for is that which even the Angels \nenvy: love. The human heart is imbued with the unique capacity for loving - it yearns to \nlove. It wants to share love, and it wants to be loved. So now, while we can, we must do \neverything possible to derive the charm of love, for it is only as human beings that we can \nactually begin to love. \n\"What is the source of that love which you can begin to experience as human beings? Baba \nwould ask. It is none other than myself. I have given that love - shared it with you - so that \nyou can return it to me, and in the process, derive the charm of loving. In the course of its \nreturn, however, Baba pointed out that love gets dissipated in loving shadows, rather than \nloving the source of love itself. \n\"Baba explained that, in the process of the return of love to love itself, a man will inevitably \nfall in love with a woman, and vice versa. It is natural, and there is nothing wrong in that. \nThere comes a time in this process of love seeking love, in the process of God's divine game \nof loving and being loved, that a man sees a woman, or a woman sees a man, and something \nflares up deep within them. According to Baba, this experience occurs only once in a great \nwhile, and it is indescribable. All of the heart goes out to that person, and the experience is \nan agonisingly happy one. \n\"The result is that the person who has such an experience wants to do anything and \neverything for that person to whom his heart has gone out. You want to go all out for that \nperson, thinking and caring endlessly for nothing but that person. You go truly mad with \nlove, in short. This is a beautiful moment, the rarest moment for which this human form has \nbeen created. We have inherited this form for this particular moment. \n\"When such a moment dawns, Baba says, we should try our utmost not to lose it. We must \ntry to nurture it, and do everything possible to preserve it. For when we allow the feeling of \nthat sublime moment to grow, it bursts into a flame, and then a fire. That fire is the \nbeginning of real love, a burning experience of being consumed. \n\"If at this point, Baba says, instead of allowing that feeling to be consummated, you get \nyourself consumed in it, then you are no more. You become lost in it and are yourself \nconsumed. Unfortunately, however, what tends to happen - through our human frailties - is \nthat we waste the opportunity. And again we get another such opportunity, and then again \nwe waste it. And on and on it goes. How do we waste the opportunity? We waste it by \nconsummating the feeling through sex play culminating in intercourse. We waste this divine \nopportunity by consummating that love, rather than being consumed in it. \n\"In giving us this explanation, Baba then demonstrated what happens as a result of \nconsummating this divine impulse to love. You are now enmeshed in a dilemma. You put \nyour hands over your head and you sit there, not knowing what to do. The world now \nimpresses itself upon you in full force as you become surrounded by children and all the \nconcerns of family life. And this experience, in contrast to that divine urge to love which \npreceded the consummation, creates within you an enormous conflict and struggle. \n\"If, on the other hand, instead of allowing yourself to consummate that feeling of love, you \nallow yourself to be consumed by it, the result is most beautiful and sublime. Then there is \nno such thing as individuality left. Every thing and every being seem to be one. In this \nexperience consists the meaning of rising above sex. In such a state you begin to love so \nintensely, Baba said, that you eventually begin to love him - the divine beloved from whom \nyou have received that feeling of love. \n\"The time comes, he says, in your process of loving me, when I myself become your lover. I, \nthe beloved, become your lover. And you, who began as my lover, become transformed into \nmy beloved. In this transformation lies the union that is the end of it all. That union is called \nRealisation, and when that occurs, nothing else remains. In that ultimate experience, Baba \nsays, I and you become one. \n\"Sex, then, has to play its role in order to give us that experience which can ultimately help \nus to lose ourselves, and find our real self. Time and again we play with sex, but sex is there \nso that we can rise above it, and find our way to the ultimate goal: to be consumed in divine \nlove. Only by beloved Baba's grace - or that of the Perfect Master - is it possible to reach the \ngoal of being completely consumed in love divine. \n\"Along the way, it inevitably happens that we engage in various interplays, which we call \nlittle love affairs, in our unconscious attempts to find true love in the divine love affair. With \nrespect to such interludes, Baba was always very clear and firm: if anyone wants to \nconsummate that feeling of love for another person, then one must do everything within \none's power to remain with that partner for a lifetime, to remain constant and true to that \npartner. We must not flitter around from one flower to another, like birds and bees. As \nhuman beings we are expected to be steadfast. \n\"In so many words, this is what Baba has said. Man tries again and again to learn through \nhis experiences, and again and again he falters and fails. Countless times I have heard and \nseen people come to beloved Baba with all their woes, with all their failures. And every \ntime, without fail, he forgives and comforts them, saying, don't worry - it's all right. Learn \nfrom it. Don't fall again.\" \nEruch Jessawala, Meherazad, from a tape-recording \n'The Way and The Goal' 2:8 (May 1984) p1-4 \nIn the 1960s Alain Youell visited Meher Baba in India. Alain was a young man from England, \nand a friend of Don Stevens. Baba told Alain, during their daily walks in the garden, to ask \nhim anything he wanted to know. One of things Alain asked him about was homosexuality. \nBaba told him that homosexuality was generally the result of the soul having taken a series \nof incarnations in one sex, and then switching to the other sex. \nA soul may have incarnated a number of times in female form, and then takes a male form. \nIn that male form, the mind still feels sexually attracted to men, as it has for many lifetimes, \neven though one is oneself now in a male form. \nA soul who had incarnated many times in male forms, when it first takes a female form, \nmight, in that new form, still feel sexually attracted to women rather than men. \nBaba said that, for homosexuals, the one thing to avoid is promiscuity. He said it was best to \ntry and find one partner and stay with that person, rather than have sex with many people. \nThis is what Baba generally told heterosexuals as well. He only recommended celibacy for \nadvanced aspirants, and then, only in certain cases. \nOL \n\"The soul is eternally and absolutely sexless. However, during the process of reincarnation, \nwith the counterbalancing of opposite impressions (eunuch, man, woman), the embodied \nsoul's human consciousness accumulates, and therefore contains, sanskaras of both \nopposite sexes. Both male and female sex sanskaras exist in the human mind and human \nform. \n\"However, the state of human consciousness is that the homosexual is in male form, but is \nworking out or spending his female sanskaras, whereas he is meant to be spending his male \nsanskaras, since the soul has reincarnated as a man. A lesbian is working out or spending \nher male sanskaras, whereas she is meant to be spending her female sanskaras, since the \nsoul has reincarnated as a woman.\" \nBhau Kalchuri, 1994, repeating from memory something \nMeher Baba explained to him in 1967 or 1968, LM6 p2213 fn \nFor more on sex, see the chapter 'Marriage' in Book One and Book Two of this book.

LM2 p719 \nBaba told the Mandali, \n\"Why do you get angry so often? You frequently break my orders. Then if I have anything to \nsay about it, you get annoyed. Thereby your attitude adds to my burden. \n\"One's degree of connection with a Perfect Master in past lives makes one eligible for a \nMaster's Circle, whether he is willing or unwilling to obey. But to ease the Master's burden, \none should follow his orders. By your wrong attitude, you add to the Master's troubles. \n\"Suppose I want two of you to journey with me. One is unwilling and does not budge an \ninch. The other willingly goes. Both must be taken at the same time to the same place. \nWhereas one can be taken easily, the other must be taken with difficulty. At times it comes \nto this: for my work, the  one resisting has to be shouldered and taken forcibly by me. \n\"While shaving you, the barber moves your head from side to side, which you permit \nbecause you need a good shave. Similarly, if you want God, you should surrender body and \nmind to the Perfect Master and act as he says. \n\"The waters of a river are for the use of the populace. The containers the people bring to fill \nwith water are large or small according to their needs. In the same way, the Sadgurus are \nthere only to give. They are the storehouses of knowledge and unlimited blessings. Those \nwho have merit can take as much as their containers can contain. \nMeher Baba, 30 April 1926, Meherabad, LM3 p791 \n\"... Self-surrender implies obedience of all the orders of the Master. When all your desires \nand actions are guided by him, and are the result of your obeying his orders, he becomes \ndirectly responsible for them. Thus when self-surrender is thorough, the responsibility for \nyour release from sanskaras is devolved upon the Master, and under this new condition the \nMaster annihilates all your sanskaras in no time. \n\"Obedience to the Master, as implied in full self-surrender, is of two kinds: \n1. Intellectual, and \n2. Literal. \n\"Of these two types of obedience, intellectual obedience comes first, and is a preliminary to \nliteral obedience, which is more fruitful. When you are intellectually convinced about the \ngreatness and Perfection of the Master, you have love and respect for him, but are unable to \nfollow his orders literally. Reason being the basis of your conviction, you find it difficult to \ndivorce it from your understanding of the Master and his orders. And as the two are \ninextricably intertwined with each other, your reasoned faith holds you within the limits of \nintelligible obedience. This phase of the pupil is left undisturbed by the Master, and all the \npills of obedience offered by him are intellectualised in order to suit his taste and caliber. \nThrough intellectual obedience of the Master, you can annihilate all your sanskaras, \nprovided you are sincere in your logical interpretation of his orders, and in their execution. \n\"But the result comes much quicker if your obedience is literal. Literal obedience is the \neffect of the rock-like faith and deep love which the Master inspires in the pupil through his \nhuman appeal. The overflowing radiance of the halo of the Master, and the effulgence of \npurity and compassion, are mainly responsible for creating in the pupil an unswerving faith, \nwhich prepares him to follow the orders of the Master implicitly, irrespective of their \nsatisfying his critical spirit. Such literal obedience is not even bound by the requirement \nthat the real significance of orders should be within the intellectual comprehension of the \npupil, and it is the best type of obedience which you can aspire for. \n\"Through such implicit and unquestioning obedience, all the crooked knots of your desires \nand sanskaras are set straight; and it is through such obedience that a deep link is created \nbetween the Master and the pupil, with the result that there is an unhindered and perennial \nflow of spiritual wisdom and power into the pupil. At this stage the pupil becomes the \nspiritual son of the Master; and in due time, he is freed from all individualistic and sanskaric \nties, and he himself becomes a Master.\" \nMeher Baba, Di v.1 p70-72 \n\"If your obedience is as spontaneous, complete and natural as light is to the eye or smell to \nthe nose, then you will come to me.\" \nMeher Baba, 1940s? Di (7th ed.) p405 \nBaba: What are you reading? \nFeram Workingboxwala: Nothing in particular. \nBaba: Do you know anything about spirituality? \nFeram: I understand a little. \nBaba: What is that little? \nFeram: (pause) To do as Baba says. \nBaba: It is the only thing to be learned on the spiritual Path. This is spirituality from A to Z. \nYou have put it in a nutshell. That is everything. \n24 December 1947, Meherabad, LM9 p3210-3211 \n\"The giving up of life in an emotional outburst of the moment is quite cheap compared with \nthe day-to-day carrying out of the Master's instructions through the thick and thin of one's \nlife. \n\"Sometimes soldiers of very ordinary calibre can also perform acts of sacrifice and heroism \nunder particular circumstances and impulses of the moment.\" \nMeher Baba, 23 June 1951, Jubilee Hills, \nHyderabad, LM10 p3700 \nA man loves a woman who is living in a distant place. His love causes him to be thinking of \nher all the time, and he cannot eat, and he cannot sleep. His thoughts are only on his \nseparation from her, and he continually longs for her. \nWhen this longing becomes too great, he either goes to her, or he compels her to come to \nhim. This is called Ishk-e-Mijazi, or physical love. \nTo love God, one should think of God, long for God, and suffer the fire of separation, until \none's longing reaches its utmost limits, and God the beloved comes to the lover, and his \nthirst is quenched in union with God. This love is called Ishk-e-Haqqiqi, and is a gift from \nGod. \nBut one who obeys the Master who is one with God need not suffer these things, for in \nobedience is the grace of the Master. \nMeher Baba, c.1960?

    "text": "THE ANGER OF A PERFECT MASTER \nTHE ANGER OF A PERFECT MASTER \n\"While discussing the temperamental makeup of a certain disciple of Baba, I happened to \ninquire whether the human nature of a man undergoes any radical transformation after \nGod-realisation, or whether the said characteristics in him do persist even afterwards. Baba \nsaid, \n\"'The nature or Tabiyat of a person after becoming one with God remains the same, but it is \nexpressed in a different light. Formerly in the ordinary state a man's anger, greed, curses, \nabuses, were for himself only, and besides being harmful to the surroundings, they usually \nrecoiled on himself, because they were the outcome of his self-egoism. Where there is ego, \nthere is no God, and where there is God, there is no room for egoism. But the actions and \nwords of a God-realised man are deviod of all egoistic tendencies, and although the original \ncharacteristics of his mind and nature do persist in him after God-realisation, they do \nnothing but good to the surroundings whenever expressed. \n\"'Hafez has said, \nKhatiram waqti havas kardi ke binam chiz ha \nTa tora didam na daram juz badidarat havas. \n\"'The couplet explains very clearly that \"it was ingrained in his nature to see different and \nvarious objects. But on seeing Him, he does not want to see anything but Him.\" It only \nmeans that the desire of his nature is to see things and objects, and and now he wants to see \nGod only. The desire of seeing remains the same, but it is now shorn of its egoism. Likewise \nthe habits of anger, abuses, beatings, etc. remain ingrained in a person even after his \nbecoming a saint, but a colossal change takes place in its expression. Whenever and on \nwhomsoever it is expressed or expended, it results in nothing but good to the recipients \nthereof, since there is no personal motive behind it. \n\"'When a saint is in the most perfect and peaceful internal state, or some internal work of \nhis is nearing completion and success, there sometimes occurs automatically an overflow of \nthe internal state externally. The external outburst by a saint is the shadow of the internal \nperfect state, and is radically contraindicatory of the bliss within, and consequently in its \nouter manifestation it takes the form of abusive language, beatings, etc. But whosoever \nreceives these ego-shattering blessings from a Master in the form of abuses and physical \nchastisement is very lucky indeed, and undoubtably a good deal of benefit accrues to him, \nespecially in external affairs. \n\"'Now you people, since your connection with me is settled and determined from Roz-e-Azal \n(the first day of creation), and which connection no power on earth can alter or modify, you \nhave no need of these outbursts in the form of abuses and beatings. Even when it occurs you \nshould not mind. During the course of my spiritual working, very often the cup of my bliss \noverflows, and I share it with the fortunate one nearest at hand.'\" \nAbdul Ghani, TY p81-83 \n(31 January  1923, Bombay) \nAlso RD p145 and LM2 p473 \nAnother version of the last paragraph: \n\"Now you people, since your matter is settled, and your connection with me is of the day of \nbeginning, that no power can alter, you have no need of these abuses and beatings, which I \nhave completely put a stop to. And now if you cannot even bear my words, then it will be \ntroublesome to both you and me. In that case, I shall have to give up mixing with people \naltogether, and then it will go very hard with you all.\" \nMeher Baba, RD p145 \nYet another version: \n\"When a Master is in the most perfect and peaceful internal state, or when some internal \nwork is nearing successful completion, there sometimes automatically occurs an overflow of \nthis internal state in an outward manner. The external outburst by a Master is the shadow \nof his internal perfect state, and is radically contradictory to the bliss within. Consequently, \nin its outer manifestation, it takes the form of abusive language, shouting and beatings. But \nwhosoever receives these ego-shattering blessings from a Perfect Master is very lucky \nindeed, since these tongue-lashings and physical beatings work miracles for him, and bring \nhim unimaginable benefit, especially in his external affairs.\" \nMeher Baba, 31 January 1923, \nBombay, LM2 p473 \n\"The anger of a Sadguru is beneficial to those connected with him and to others, but the \nanger of an ordinary man is harmful.\" \nMeher Baba, LM3 p769 \n\"Baba once explained that when the Master showed emotions such as annoyance, \ndisappointment, anger, etc., it meant that he was using a special form of energy for certain \ndeep-seated sanskaras with which he was dealing for the spiritual benefit of the devotee or \nperson. It did not imply that his inner serenity was disturbed at all, as when an ordinary \nperson shows any of these emotions.\" \nKitty Davy, LA p 114 \nBack to top",

It is an \nautomatic reflex action of which he is unconscious, like the sound of snoring is to the fast-\nasleep man emitting it. Like the sleep-walker, who is unconscious of his actions, however \nnormal or varied they may be, the Majzoob is oblivious to his body and surroundings, and is \nconscious only of his divine state of 'I am God.'\" \nMeher Baba, GS p150 \n\"The Mental-conscious soul... keeps waiting till it merges with God or Truth in the seventh \nplane. After merger, the soul may remain immersed in the bliss of God-realisation and \nbecome a Majzoob, or come down to the lower planes of duality for work (without losing its \nrealisation of the unitary Truth) and become a Perfect Master. Whether a particular God-\nrealised soul becomes a Majzoob or a Perfect Master is a matter decided by the initial urge \nin creation. These varieties of terminal states are not subject to sanskaric or impressional \ndetermination. In both terminal states there is no trace of any binding impressions. \nHowever, the entire fabric of the universe serves but one purpose: the realisation of God.\" \nMeher Baba, Be p17 \n\"The Avatar can do all that a Sadguru does. He has and prepares a Circle as a Sadguru does, \nbut he does one special thing also. The Avatar can make a person who is not even in the \nCircle, or turned to God, a God-realised Salik with special duty... \nKrishna was an Avatar, and he Realised and brought down seventeen people who were \noutside his Circle. These seventeen were extra God-realised souls.\" \nMeher Baba, 29 December 1927, \nMeherabad, LM3 p1002 \n\"If we study the teachings of Meher Baba we find that Realised beings may be divided, for all \npractical purposes, into three types: the Majzoob, the Jivanmukta, and the Perfect Master. \nThe Majzoob is merged - completely and utterly so - in God. Sufis call this state the final \nfana, and it is a state in which the soul experiences, but does not use, infinite power, infinite \nknowledge and infinite bliss. This means that although the Majzoob is conscious of himself \nas God, he is quite oblivious of the three spheres - Gross, Subtle and Mental... \n\"Meher Baba tells us that the Perfect Master experiences and uses infinite power, infinite \nknowledge and infinite bliss, and, on top of this, that he is conscious also of the three \nspheres. Most important of all, he has the authority to use his infinite powers, and so can \nhelp all living things towards their ultimate goal, and can also make certain souls spiritually \nperfect... \n\"The state of consciousness of the Jivanmukta... varies from time to time, and is sometimes a \nconsciousness of himself as God (exactly like the Majzoob, in fact), and sometimes a \nconsciousness of one or other of the spheres - Gross, Subtle or Mental (not at all like the \nMajzoob, in fact). It is also necessary to explain that when the Jivanmukta is conscious of \nhimself as God, He is not conscious of any of the spheres, and that, vice versa, when he is \nconscious of any particular sphere, he is not conscious of himself as God. Nevertheless, \nwhatever his state of consciousness, i.e., whether of himself as God or of some sphere or \nother, he always is, and always will be, one with God. I should mention finally that Meher \nBaba told us that the Perfect Master always has 'duty' while in the body, but that the \nMajzoob and the Jivanmukta do not.\" \nWilliam Donkin, Wo-a (1948-1949) p27-28 \nDonkin's description of the Jivanmukta above may (by mistake) actually describe the state \nof the Paramhansa.

    "text": "FOLLOWERS OF PERFECT MASTERS \nFOLLOWERS OF PERFECT MASTERS \n\"Masters of the fifth and sixth planes take unto themselves disciples, initiate them into the \nPath, and thereafter leave the whole responsibility for achieving progress in the Path to the \ndisciples themselves. Hence arises the need for papers on different practices and \nmeditation. The gain herein is in direct proportion to the exertion by the disciple - of course, \nunder the guidance and supervision of the master, who is the salik of the particular plane. \nThis rules out the question of the imposition on aspirants of disciplinary exercises and \nesoteric papers by unqualified and unauthorised masters. \n? \nElect and Select Disciples \nThe Perfect one of the seventh plane of God-realisation - the Qutub - has a different \ntechnique altogether in the matter of dealing with aspirants. Every Qutub has two types of \ndisciples - the Elect and the Select. \n\"The Elect ones are those who have a sort of spiritual relationship with the Master (Qutub), \nborn of services rendered or part played toward him, even antagonistically, in past \nincarnations. Such aspirants are invariably the claimants to the spiritual heritage of the \nMaster. And even if they appear of indifferent caliber in the present life, the Master trains \nand prepares them in his company to become fit and deserving recipients of his divine \ngrace. 'When the disciple is ready, the Master comes,' is said of aspirants belonging to this \ncategory. Their number is always twelve. The twelve apostles of Christ and the twelve \nimams of Hazrat Ali are suggestive of this situation. \n\"Select disciples of a Master have an unlimited scope, qualitatively and quantitatively. These \nare the fortunate ones who earn the grace of the Perfect One (Qutub) by sheer dint of merit \nand services rendered. The spiritual benefit accruing to this category is in proportion to the \nquality of their self-surrender to the will of the Master. It is such aspirants who are in need \nof disciplinary exercises and meditation papers. Visualising these two types - the Elect and \nSelect ones - I gave you the impression in my previous letters that exercises and papers are \nboth necessary and unnecessary. The Elect ones are the inheritors, and the Select ones are \nthe winners of the Master's grace. \n\"Thus, in the domain of Perfection of the seventh plane of God-realisation (the Qutub), the \nquestion of initiation and discipleship doesn't arise. Every atom of the universe is \nequidistant from the center, the Qutub, round which everything and everyone revolves. In \nfact, according to Baba, one is entitled to call himself or herself a disciple only after getting \nIllumination from the Master. Till such time, all - high or low, near or distant - are mere \naspirants, and nothing more. \n\"Saheb-e-Zaman or Avatar \nBaba stands in a different category altogether. Baba is not only a Qutub, but at this cyclic \nperiod in the history of the world, he is the Qutub of all Qutubs, the Saheb-e-Zaman or \nAvatar. Unlike all Qutubs or Sadgurus, whose Circle of intimate disciples consists of twelve, \nin Avataric periods the Avatar has a Circle of 120 disciples, 'all of whom experience \nRealisation and work for the liberation of others.' These 120 are heirs, by right of past \nassociation, to the spiritual treasure of the Avatar; and the beneficiaries thereof, as said \nbefore, are numerous. In fact, Baba has been heard to have remarked that besides his Circle, \nwho all will be as Perfect as himself, more than a lakh of souls will have Illumination at his \nhands before his mission comes to an end.* \n\"You will thus see that a Qutub, or for that matter an Avatar, never goes through the \nformality of accepting and initiating a disciple. The relationship with the Master known as \ndiscipleship has got to be formed and forged by the aspirant himself, the criterion for which \nis the quality of self-surrender. The Master, in due course, requites the aspirant's efforts in \nthis direction by imparting Illumination in proportion to the sincerity of purpose and the \nintensity of longing displayed. \n\"A master of the fifth or sixth plane (still laboring in the domain of duality) teaches an \naspirant to earn Illumination by self-exertion, while the Perfect one, the Qutub, bestows on \nthe aspirant by way of a gift his divine grace, for which the only condition necessary is to \nestablish a link or connection with him by self-surrender. \nAbdul Ghani, 10 September 1948, from \na letter to Ivy Duce, HM p718-719 \n*lakh = 100,000 \nIllumination = the conscious, continual experience of seeing God face-to-face on the sixth \nplane of consciousness \nBack to top",

Irani told of one occasion when Meher Baba explained that for every 'rule' \nthere is an exception. For example, he said, Perfect Masters never incarnate again -- but the \nfive Perfect Masters who bring down the Avatar do incarnate again. Adi said Baba did not \nexplain how or when they incarnate again, or whether they always, or just occasionally, take \nanother human form. Adi also commented, If you ask the other Mandali about this, they will \ndeny it -- but I was there, and they were not. \nOn March 20, 1954, at Sakori, Meher Baba explained, referring to his Master Upasani \nMaharaj, \n'I will come back after 700 years, when Maharaj will have to come back to bestow on me my \nAncient state.' \n(LM12 p4389) \nBack to top \nTHREE TYPES OF FANA \n\"Fana is of three types: \nFana-Fillah \nFana-fi-Sheikh \nFana-fi-Rasool \n\"In Fana-Fillah, a person becomes one with God. There are 56 persons existing in this state \nalways. \n\"In Fana-fi-Sheikh, a person becomes one with the consciousness of a Qutub. He is one with \nthe infinite consciousness of the Qutub, but he is not one with the office of the Qutub. In the \nFana-fi-Sheikh state he does use, sometimes, and to a very limited extent, the infinite \npower-knowledge-bliss. The person in the Fana-fi-Sheikh state drops his body immediately \nafter the Qutub, who has brought him to the state of Fana-fi-Sheikh, drops his body. There \nare five Qutubs (Perfect Masters) existing always. \n\"In Fana-fi-Rasool, which is a very rare state, and occurs very rarely, a person becomes one \nwith the Avatar (Rasool). When it does happen, it is during the Avatar's physical presence \non Earth, and just before the unique worldwide manifestation of the Avatar. It is a rare \noccurrence. It has happened in the past. None from the Fana-Fillah state can become one of \nthe Fana-fi-Rasool state. An ordinary man, who is only Gross-conscious, is chosen by the \nAvatar himself, and on him is bestowed the state of Fana-fi-Rasool. In Fana-fi-Rasool the \nperson becomes like the Avatar, but does not hold the Avatar's office, and he drops his body \nimmediately after the Avatar drops his body... \n\"In the Fana-Fillah state there are 56 souls. The state of Baqa means to be established in \nGod, and being able to use infinite power, infinite knowledge and infinite bliss. A Qutub is \nthe one who leads the life of God and uses infinite power, infinite knowledge and infinite \nbliss. \n\"Some Sufis believe that Fana-Fillah is the highest state.

    "text": "POLITICS \nBook Two \n\"Politics, social welfare, economics, et cetera, are but different facets of the same one \nsubstance - spirituality - because each of these are included in the Knowledge of the One. \nSpirituality includes everything - politics, economics, ethics, social welfare, civics, and all \nother kinds of service. Just as the rays of the sun are not different from the sun, so also, each \nof these divisions is but a different branch of the Same Eternal One. \n\"Thus indirectly, from the point of spirituality, I always play my part in all these things, and I \nsay so, and I always make others do so. The difference is only this: that whereas the \nignorant one experiences Maya, and wants 'this and that' in Maya, the Dnyani (one who has \nrealized God) views even Maya as an expression of God and experiences it as such.\" \nMeher Baba, 1 November 1932, \nin a letter to Mahatma Gandhi, \ntranslated from Gujerati, \nLM5 p1735-1736 \n\"... He gave the following explicit instructions to all his disciples: '1. They should be above \nparty politics and should bear malice and ill-will towards none...'\" \nNaosherwan Anzar, \"The Beloved\" p54, c. 1940 \n\"Although I am in everyone and in everything, and my work is for the spiritual awakening of \nall mankind, I am always aloof from politics of any kind. My disciples and devotees should \ncontinue as before to abstain from taking part in political activities or discussion.\" \nMeher Baba, circular letter, \n1 January 1949 \n\"Practical Spirituality with Meher Baba\" \nby John Grant, p 3 \n\"The Fiery Free Life which, as God ordained, has commenced from November 15th [1952], \nmakes me plunge into my Divine Mission of bringing the Life in the Truth to everyone, \nwithout allowing it to be limited or colored by the illusions of duality. As the Divine Life \nembraces in its Being one and all, including even the members of the animal and vegetable \nkingdoms, and since from the moment of the attainment of Manonash (annihilation of the \nlimited, finite mind), I have attained complete unity with that immeasurable and illimitable \nDivine Life, I cannot and will not identify myself with any caste, creed, religion or political \nparty. \nFrom my point of view, all religions are great; but God is greater. In the same way, all \npolitical parties are, in their own way, noble, at least in their consciously accepted \nobjectives. But the claims of the Undivided and Indivisible Life are irresistibly supreme, and, \nas such, greater than those of any party, howsoever noble. Therefore, I love and adore all \nreligions; but I am of no religion. Nor do I seek to establish another religion or add to the \nnumberless illusions that divide man against man. No religion was ever intended to be \nanything more than the gateway to God as Truth; but every religion, in the course of time, \nhas been converted into a veil, obstructing the undimmed perception of the One Truth. \nAs soon as the Truth of direct inner Realization is intellectualized and formulated, it gets \nenmeshed in creeds and dogmas. These creeds and dogmas have a tendency to bind the soul \nin the very attempt to emancipate it. They cover the Truth in the very act of seeking to \nexpress it. This comic tragedy reveals itself in the retrospective analysis of all the world \nreligions bestowed on man. But it is not inevitable, if man is invariably vigilant and remains \nunwaveringly loyal to the inner perception of the inexpressible but unchangeable spiritual \nTruth, which ever affirms itself as the One, All-Embracing Life Divine, at once indivisible and \nillimitable.\" \nMeher Baba, message entitled \"Religion and Politics\" \nNovember? 1952, LM 11-12 p3980 \nIndex - Book Two \nCopyright 2005 Patra Chosnyid Skybamedpa, The Eastern School of Broad Buddhism. \nAll rights reserved.

Every sound \nyou make, every thought you think, good or bad, stays.

But you all must \nsing the song of God's names together with rhythm and timing to produce an effect. \n\"When the name of God is sung with feeling and rhythm, it even has the effect of \ntemporarily bringing down the Majzoobs from their superconscious state. Abdul Baba of \nBombay was a known Majzoob. He was always unconscious, did not eat or drink anything, \nsimply lay unconscious. But when one singer would come to his door every day singing \n'Allah Hu, Allah Hu' in rhythm, within half an hour Abdul Baba would come down to \nconsciousness, begin to look about, talk, eat, and then again merge into his former state.\" \nMeher Baba, ll October 1940 \nMeherabad, LM7 p2622 \nBack to top",

Purdom's \nGod-Man \n(1964) p. 238, and Bal Natu's \nGlimpses of the God Man \n, \nVolume III, 1952Part VIII \n, p. 180, and \nVolume V, 1954Part VIII \n, p. 157. \nThe webmaster \nPreface to THE PRAYER OF REPENTANCE \nWhen Baba had the Prayer of Repentance recited in his presence, he had this preface read \nout: \n\"O eternally merciful Paramatma, \nAllah, \nMost merciful benevolent God, \nMost merciful God almighty, \nYezdan, the bestower, \nyou are absolutely independent. \nO infinitely merciful Paramatma, \nknowing that you are so absolutely independent \nI have taken hold of your independence \nand I am approaching you. \nI, Baba, with absolute humility, \non my behalf and on behalf of all who love me, \nand on behalf of all worthy penitents, \nI wish to express my repentance. \nPlease accept what I now say on behalf of all:\" \n(Then the Prayer of Repentance was read out) \nMeher Baba \n2 May 1953, Aw 19:2 p12 \nEruch Jessawala commented: \"So at that moment we thought and felt that we all were \nabsolutely absolved from all our sins.\" \n(Aw 19:2 p12) \nBack to top \nTHE MASTER'S PRAYER \nO Parvardigar \nthe preserver \nand protector \nof all: \nYou are \nwithout beginning \nand without end \nnon-dual \nbeyond comparison \nand none \ncan measure you. \nYou are without color \nwithout expression \nwithout form \nand without attributes. \nYou are unlimited \nand unfathomable \nbeyond imagination \nand conception \neternal \nand imperishable. \nYou are indivisible \nand none can see you \nbut with eyes divine. \nYou always were \nyou always are \nand you always will be. \nYou are everywhere \nyou are in everything \nand you are also \nbeyond everywhere \nand beyond everything. \nYou are in the firmament \nand in the depths, \nYou are manifest \nand unmanifest, \non all planes \nand beyond all planes. \nYou are in the three worlds \nand also beyond \nthe three worlds. \nYou are imperceptible \nand independent. \nYou are the Creator, \nthe lord of lords, \nthe knower of \nall minds and hearts. \nYou are omnipotent \nand omnipresent. \nYou are knowledge infinite \npower infinite \nand bliss infinite. \nYou are the ocean \nof knowledge, \nall-knowing, \ninfinitely knowing, \nthe knower of the past, \nthe present, \nand the future, \nand you are \nknowledge itself. \nYou are all-merciful \nand eternally benevolent. \nYou are the soul of souls, \nthe one with infinite attributes. \nYou are the trinity \nof truth, knowledge, and bliss. \nYou are the source of truth \nthe ocean of love. \nYou are the Ancient One \nthe highest of the high. \nYou are Prabhu \nand Parameshwar. \nYou are the Beyond God \nand the Beyond Beyond God also. \nYou are Parabrahma \nAllah \nElahi \nYezdan \nAhuramazda \nand God the Beloved. \nYou are named Ezad, \nthe only one worthy of worship. \nMeher Baba, \n20? August 1953 \nDehra Dun (original in Gujerati) \nLC p33-34 \nBack to top \nSAT-CHIT-ANAND PARAMANAND \nKeshav Nigam asked Baba to send one of his Mandali to the laying of the cornerstone of a \ntemple to be built at Nauranga, Hamipur. The temple was called Meher Mandir; later the \nname was changed to Meher Dham, which means 'Meher's abode.' Baba sent Bhau Kalchuri, \nand gave him a 'message' for Baba's lovers: \nSat-Chit-Anand \nParamanand \nMeher Baba \nVidnyanand \nR. S. Singh Baghel of Ichhaura put the words of the 'message' to music, and it has been sung \never since. \nJanuary 1955, GG6 p218 \nBack to top \nPRAYERS FOR BABA'S LOVERS AND MANDALI \nBeloved God \nhelp us all to love you \nmore and more \nand more and more \nand still yet more \nuntil we become worthy of union with you \nand help us all \nto hold fast to Baba's daaman \ntill the very end. \nMeher Baba \n25 August 1959, Meherazad \nAw 19:2 p12 \nI have been told that the original version of this prayer read, \nBeloved God \nhelp us all to love you \nmore and more \nand more and more \nand still yet more \nuntil we become worthy of union with you \nand help us all \nto hold fast to Baba's daaman \ntill the very end. \nThe story was that one of the Mandali had suggested that some of Baba's followers would \nnot be happy with the words, 'until we are no more.' So Baba substituted the words 'until \nwe become worthy of union with you.' Anyone who knows if this is true, please \ncommunicate with me. \nThe Editor",

The men would be on one side, and the women on \nthe other. \n\"Baba would come to the men, and then Eruch would recite the prayers. All the men stood \nup, and Baba stood up every time with joined hands. \n\"And then he would come to the women Mandali. They would all stand up, I would recite \nthe prayers, and again Baba would stand with hands joined. \n\"Even then it didn't strike us, because this was the first time he did that. And Baba said that \nsuch a prayer had never been before, and never will be, and that his 'reciting,' his \nparticipating in the prayer while we said it (he stood only because he would not utter the \nwords; it was him praying, really), his joining in the prayer with us would mean benefit for \neach one who recited this prayer. And after he dropped his body, the benefit would be great \nfor them.\" \nMani Irani, Poona, 14 April 1969, HM p 609-610 \n\"When a prayer was given by him... some words were in Gujerati, Urdu, some in Hindi or \nPersian, most in English. Then we'd do a little dressing-up in English, and read it out to \nBaba, and he'd approve what he'd dictated. He also inspired the ones who were doing the \ndressing-up. The whole thing was 'rattled out' in the first place, given quite spontaneously... \n\"Then there were the traditional 'orthodox' prayers Baba wanted us to recite. I still \nremember them: a Christian prayer, a Zoroastrian prayer, a Sikh prayer. These were sorted \nout for special occasions. A Christian woud be asked to read a Christian prayer, a Hindu a \nHindu prayer, a Muslim a Muslim prayer, a Buddhist a Buddhist prayer. Followers of Guru \nNanak would be asked to read a Sikh prayer... \n\"We were asked to recite the '101 Names of God' according to the Zoroastrian prayer book. \nWe used to recite them without knowing the meaning behind them, for they are in a dead \nlanguage of ten thousand years ago. Baba translated each one of the 101 names of God, what \neach name meant. For example, Ezad means 'the one worthy of worship.' \n\"... Whenever Baba expressed his desire, his pleasure that we should collect ourselves and \ngather for prayers, it was a serious and solemn affair. It was not as we now are, in good \nhumor, talking in a lighter vein about this solemn and serious matter. \n\"We still have that water pot and that blue basin here in Mandali Hall which he used to wash \nhis hands and face before the prayers. He would not only participate with us in the prayers, \nbut prepare himself for such prayers. He didn't say anything to us, that we should keep \nprepared for prayers. But knowing his ways, and how he would want us to keep clean and \ntidy for prayers, we also remained prepared, not knowing when he would ask us to recite \nthe prayers. We would keep our feet ready, washed and clean, for who knows when he \nwould want us to put our foot forward for him to bow down to. With the God-man putting \nhis head on our feet, we couldn't stand around dirty or with wet feet. We had to keep \nourselves clean and prepared for all such occasions. But many times we were caught \nunawares. Then he would say, 'It's all right, it doesn't matter.' \n\"He would be the first one who kept himself prepared for the prayers. After having washed \nhis hands and splashed water on his face, and after properly drying his face and hands with \na napkin, he would call the rest of the Mandali in his presence. He wouldn't want anybody to \nmiss the occasion. He wanted all his Mandali around him at the time of prayers. Then he'd \nstart. He would stand up and gesture, 'Say the prayer.' \n\"Naturally, in the beginning, we had to read it out, the Master's Prayer. It came to my lot to \nread the prayer aloud while all would remain silent. All present had to be silent, while any \none person would recite or read the prayer. Baba would stand up, and remain standing, \nduring the whole prayer, and all of us would be standing around him in a circle. He \nremained the central figure, either here or at Guruprasad or anywhere in the country, \nwherever he chose to pray. \n\"At the time of reading aloud the Master's Prayer, I once felt that Baba would want me to \nrecite it instead of reading it out. So I tried to learn it by heart. Also just in case no prayer \nbook was available. I felt confident that I could now do away with the book. When Baba \ncalled as usual for the prayer book printed by Warren Healy. Remember him? A beautiful \nsoul. He lived a dedicated life printing so many Baba booklets. \n\"I replied, 'Baba, I have learnt it by heart.' \n'So you learned the prayer?' \n'Yes, Baba.' \n'Good. Recite.' \n'O Parvardigar, the preserver and protector of...' \n\"I couldn't even remember a word beyond this. So Baba waited for awhile, and I tried again? \nEventually he gestured 'Go get the book.' \n\"Never again did I attempt to recite it by heart. I always read the prayer in front of him. To \nthis day, I don't know any of the prayers by heart. \n\"So I had to read them out from the prayer book every time he asked for the prayers. All \nwould be there. Baba would join his hands and stand as one of us in our midst, and his look \nand his gaze woudl be of one deep in the act of adoration, totally absorbed, participating in \nthe prayers... After the prayer ended with 'You are named Ezad - the only one worthy of \nworship,' he would bow down, like this, in the act of worship. After a minute of this, Baba \nwould want the prayer to be followed by the Prayer of Repentance. Everyone would be in \nreadiness as I would begin to read out 'We repent, O God most merciful...' \nHis gesture for the Repentance Prayer was that he would begin to softly slap his cheeks with \nboth hands. Now this is the gesture denoting repentance (Eruch slapped his cheeks). It's not \njust this... patting your cheeks. Among the worshippers, may they be Muslims, Hindus, \nZoroastrians, while they pray for repentance, it is customary for the one to slap one's cheeks \nwith both hands while saying, 'I repent, I repent.' \n\"The Mandali were there with Baba for the prayer, but he didn't want the Mandali to slap \ntheir cheeks as a mark of repentance, because it was he who did it on our behalf. We could \nhear him constantly slapping his cheeks during the entire prayer, but this was not at all \ndisturbing, as he slapped softly but audibly. \n\"Once Baba guided me to say at the end of this prayer, 'Amen.' So I do it every time I end the \nprayer...\" \n\"The sequel to the Prayer of Repentance in presence of Baba was very thought-provoking. \nThis is how it was: he would sit down in Mandali Hall after the prayer on his sofa chair, and \nsome sort of high footstool would be improvised in front of Baba, so that he could easily \nbend down while sitting and place his forehead on the foot of the Mandali. He would \ngesture, \n'Put your right foot here. At the moment of contact, when my forehead touches you, you call \naloud one name of God that's dear to you, as many times as my forehead touches your foot.' \n\"So Zoroastrians used to call out 'Ahuramazda' at the moment of contact... 'Ahuramazda' \nwould be heard by the rest of the Mandali each time Baba made contact. It might be six or \nseven times - we wouldn't know the number of times he'd want to do it. The Muslims say \n'Allah' at the moment of contact. Christians called out 'God the Beyond.' And some called out \n'Parvardigar.' The Iranis called out 'Yezdan.' The Sikhs were heard saying 'Wahi-Guru,' \nwhich means God in the Beyond Beyond state. \n\"We were a cosmopolitan group around Baba. It would not be a crowd, but just a few \nMandali, about ten, eleven or twelve of us around him, that's all, but we were a \ncosmopolitan group. \n\"So this would happen day after day. Sometimes for months together, there would not be \nsuch prayers, and sometimes it would be a daily affair. There was no set schedule, no such \nthing as a daily repetition. Yet, if it was his pleasure, you had to present yourself at the time \nof the prayer call, when you had to leave everything and be in attendance.... \n\"But in later years, in 1968, when his health was visibly deteriorating, going from bad to \nworse, he ordered for the prayers to be read out daily... At the time of the prayer, Baba \nwould ask someone to help him stand up, because one must stand up for prayers, and he \nsaid he had to participate in the prayers. So he started with one person helping him stand \nup. Then I would begin to read the prayers. Often he would gesture, 'Let's finish it off soon.' \n\"Now the prayer he had dictated for humanity is meant for human beings to say with all \ntheir heart and soul, so you can't rush through any prayer, much less the Master's Prayer. \nYet the author, while he participates as one of humanity, says 'Finish it off soon.' So \nnaturally I say it out a little bit more rapidly, knowing that his health condition does not \npermit him to stand up for a longer time. \n\"Then, with the passage of time, as months passed by, it wasn't possible for him to stand \nalone; someone had to hold him. And all the time he remained standing with hands folded \nand joined like this (Eruch demonstrated). The time did come when each day he gestured, \n'Read it faster.' So I read the prayer faster and more rapidly each day. \n\"Then a time came when two people had to hold him, and he looked as if he wasn't there \nwith us - far away, somewhere else...  but he continued to participate solemnly as ever \nbefore. Then he'd say, snap-snapping his fingers, 'Hurry up, hurry up, read it faster.'  Later \non, at the very end of this period, I'd read it very, very rapidly, skipping periods, commas, \nand so on.One day it came to such a pitch, when he gestured 'Do it (snap) - fast! I can't stand \nup longer.' \n\"I rattled off the prayer at such high speed that it echoed in my mind as if I were an express \ntrain going through a station without any stops. I'm in the midst of reading like this, and all \nof a sudden I burst out laughing, because it was so ridiculous to me to pray like that. I could \nhear my own voice echoing as if I were rattling through all the stations. The picture came to \nme of a speeding express train, and I laughed loudly halfway through the prayer. Then I \ncontrolled myself and resumed my reading of the prayer. \n\"Baba didn't say anything. He just stood there. Everyone around me was serious. After the \nprayer ended, he sat down in his chair. Everything was finished and we settled down. After \nawhile, he asked, 'What made you laugh? What made you do that in that prayer? \n\"So I said, 'It happened uncontrollably, because I could hear my own voice rushing through \nthe whole prayer. It appeared to me I'm a railroad train rattling through all the stations \nwithout stopping, without caring for passengers. Something happened in my mind and gave \nme that picture. The situation was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing. \n\"He gestured, 'You're mad. You have no idea what is happening here. To you it seems \nridiculous. For me it is no joke, in this state of my health, to participate in this prayer. I have \ngiven it to humanity, to posterity, to say it. And whenever anyone recites it after I pass away, \nbecause of my participation now, it will help the one who repeats this prayer. \n\"'So that's why I want the prayer said. It has nothing to do with your speed or how you read \nit out, or anything of this sort. All that matters is my having participated in the prayer. So \nevery time anybody repeats the prayer, I am there with him. My presence is there.\" \nEruch Jessawala, 1980, Meherazad, \nAw 19:2 p8, 13-17 \nAnother version of part of this talk is in IT p84-85 \n\"We had a wonderful talk with Eruch yesterday on the other side of the garden wall \n(mandali quarters), and he told us many things. One was that at a certain time Baba would \nhave him read the Master's Prayer and the Prayer of Repentance to the mandali. \n\"Each day Baba would say, 'Read them faster and faster,' until Eruch realised that Baba \nwould always stand for the prayers, and that his hip must be paining him to stand. \n\"Eruch said, 'Baba, why don't you sit? After all, they are your prayers, and there is no need \nto stand.' \n\"Baba replied, 'I must stand. I want to put life into these prayers so they will go on forever.' \nElizabeth Patterson, in a letter to \nJane Haynes, 11 February 1970 \nLL p463-464 \nAn interesting story told by Eruch about Dr. Deshmukh and his reaction to Baba's prayers \ncan be found in Aw 19:2 p14-16, and another version in IT p85-87 \nBack to top",

But the prayer that reaches \nme is not a long list of your wants.That will never reach me. But just say my name. Even if it \nbe just my name, it will reach me. \n'But then, man's heart is such, when it pours out, it pours out in many words. So let those \nwords help you to glorify me. And even if there is a long, long list of all the glories that you \nattribute to me, that will reach me. \n'But when you pray asking me for something, that prayer does not reach me. But if you ask \nme and don't expect an answer, then that reaches me too. \n'Sometimes we follow him the way he wants us to, and sometimes we make him follow us, \nand that's where the trap is... Religions crop up, dogmas form, churches, temples and \nmosques are built, trying to edify him. But we forget him and adore the mansion of the Lord. \n'As Baba himself has put it, very humorously, you pray, you pray with great devotion, but \nyou pour your devotion into the prayer, and you forget the Lord to whom you pray.

One day Baba said to Naja, big Khorshed and myself, 'Come, girls, bring a pad and pencil \nand sit down.' \n\"We sat in front of Baba with our pads and pencils, and Baba asked, 'What prayers do you \nsay? \n\"We told him, 'Our sacred thread prayers, Baba.' Baba knew this prayer only took five \nminutes to say. \n\"What,' Baba said, 'you only give five minutes to God? All day long you are eating and talking \nand washing and sweeping and enjoying yourselves. All day you're tending to yourselves, \nand you can spare just five minutes to remember God and to praise him?

It took Baba about five minutes to dictate the prayer. \n\"When he had finished, Baba took big Khorshed's pad to see if she had taken the prayer \ndown properly. He corrected it, and gave it back to her. He then took Naja's pad, corrected \nthat, and gave it back to her. It was my turn, and I was still struggling with the first line. \n\"Baba looked at my pad and said, 'You've written only one line. Why is that?' \n\"I replied, 'Baba, I have had very little practice in writing Gujerati. I went to a convent, and \nnot a Parsi school, and before that I studied Gujerati for a very short time. All these years \nI've had no practice writing it.' \n\"Baba was all smiles, and he said, 'All right, give me your pencil.' He took my pencil and \nwrote down the whole prayer for me. I was very glad that I did not know how to write \nGujerati, because now I had the prayer in Baba's own handwriting. \n\"The prayer is a very beautiful one called 'Monajat.'

For my spiritual work, it is the best \npossible place. It will always be the center of my work.\" \nMeher Baba, 31 January 1930, LM4 p1266 \n\"In 1938, while strolling on Meherabad Hill, Baba made a sweeping gesture and stated, \n'The whole universe is mine, but this place is especially mine.'\" \nBal Natu, The Samadhi: Star of Infinity, p.39 \n... This hill is very sacred. The major portion of my universal work was done here. I have \nselected this spot for my last resting place. When I drop the body, it shall rest here, in my \ntomb... \nhave fasted here for six months. I used to lie down here in the crypt, taking only water and \ncoffee, not tea. I would take my bath also in the crypt. Those who have not seen the future \ntomb may now go and pay respects by bowing down. Those who have already seen it need \nnot go. \nAfter I drop my body, the physical remains will rest here, and this hill will become an \nimportant place of pilgrimage of the world. You all do not realise the importance of this day. \nAfter seventy years, this place will be a place of great privilege and pilgrimage. A big town \nwill grow up here. \nBaba, the living figure, has led you up this hill, his resting place. You can have no idea of the \nunique privilege you are having today... \nWhile bowing down at the tomb, I want you all to remember two things: \na. To love me wholeheartedly. Love does not mean the outward expression. You should love \nin such a way that you forget yourself in me, the beloved. If you cannot love me, I will love \nyou, and you will be my beloved. \nb. To give happiness to others at the cost of your happiness or comfort. \n26 February 1958, Meherabad \nAw 7:3 p29-31 \nBack to top",

The Spiritual Academy: This academy will prepare men and women who will \nauthoritatively ask the world to be selfless and God-loving. They will use intellectual \nunderstanding as their medium for secular, social and international harmony. \n2. The House of Advanced Souls: This section will prepare real mystics of the practical type. \nThese mystics will inspire others to live a life in which there will be complete detachment \nside-by-side with intense creative action. They will also help all to feel divinity in every \nphase of life. \n3. The Abode of the Saints: This section will consist of saints who will bestow true \nknowledge on souls who are ignorant. They will teach through the medium of experience \nthat the only real existence is God, and all else is illusion. \n4. The Mad (Mast) Institute: This department will be devoted to the care of such God-\nintoxicated souls as have lost their balance while cavorting the inner planes. These souls \nwill be given a further spiritual push, or brought back to normality, according to the \nrequirements of the universal plan behind the working of the universal ashram. \n5. The Solitary Quarters for Meditation: Provision shall be made for those who will most \nbenefit through meditation, with suitable quarters and such instructions as are necessary in \nparticular cases. \n6. The Resting Place for the Afflicted: This section will devote attention to the removal of \nsuffering and ailment in all its forms. It is meant to be the training ground for a group of \nselfless workers who will learn how to render real and effective service.

Avila was the birthplace of St. \nTeresa, who Baba said was a genuine saint. \n\"... At 6 pm we reached Avila. This was to be our last meal for 24 hours. Baba had a very \nspecial work to do here, and during our fast we were not to touch him, though we went \ntogether for a walk over the hills with him. \n\"Shortly before noon the next day, we crossed the square and entered the cathedral. Tall \ngrey walls, straight columns of stone supported a high, vaulted roof decorated with gold. \nThe side aisles were like dark tunnels owing to the absence of windows. The nave was \narched by a stone rib supporting on high a superb crucifix which was illuminated by shafts \nof light descending from clerestory windows. \n\"Together with Baba we saw the many treasures of the cathedral. We were very exalted. \nThe spiritual atmosphere was not unlike that of Saint Mark's at Venice, or at Assisi. As we \nleft, Baba directed that four silver coins should be given to the sacristan. \n\"We then walked through the city, to visit the shrine of Saint Teresa, built on the side of her \nformer home. The city is small and soon we were outside the crenelated walls. The terrace \non which we stood commanded the plain and exposed the hills to our view. \n\"Baba pointed to a hill behind the town and said we should walk there. Climbing up a dusty \ndonkey track, we looked back at Avila. The brilliant sun shone on its encircling walls, while \nmany bastions threw dark shadows. Steep cobbled streets led up to the cathedral-crowned \nsummit. \n\"Long ago, before the cathedral was built, Baba had been there, and we were now looking \nfor a place on the hill where he used to sit quietly, rest and meditate. \n\"The soil was dry and sandy. At last we came to a small plain that lay between two rocky \nsummits and strangely-shaped boulders. Running from left to right was a long valley six \nmiles wide, few trees and no buildings intruded on the brown plain, behind rose a line of \nblue downs  which to the right extended into a range of mountains (the Sierra Gredos). \nTheir snow-topped peaks must have been fifteen or twenty miles away. The foreground was \na sandy, rock-strewn moor, our feet crushed thyme, basil, and herbs whose names were \nunknown to us. This was the memorable place. \n\"Nature and the snow-clad mountains were surely the same. Time seemed to roll away, it \nwas wonderful to be with Baba there. As a remembrance we picked some of the fragrant \nherbs. On our return, we broke the fast and enjoyed a feast of fruits, tea and wine. \n\"Baba was so happy at Avila. There are in Europe, he explained, as in other countries, holy \nplaces, particularly connected with great spiritual working. The four centres are Saint \nMark's at Venice, a place on the Ligurian coast in Italy, Assisi and Avila. We had now visited \nthem all. They were holy ground from which sprang the saints - we naturally thought of \nSaint Francis, Saint Teresa, and her confessor Saint John of the Cross.

    "text": "THE MEMORIAL TOWER \nTHE MEMORIAL TOWER \nIn December 1944 Baba laid the foundation for a memorial tower at lower Meherabad. He \nexplained, \n\"You are today witnessing a solemn occasion of supreme importance. While the world is \nfeverishly occupied with the vanishing things of the moment, there always are those who \ngain a true perspective of life through the grace of the Master. These lucky few are ever \nwilling to make their whole life an ever-renewed and ceaseless dedication to the universal \nand ageless truth of the imperishable and undivided life divine. \n\"The spiritual grandeur of those who set aside all thoughts of the self, and make their life an \noffering to the divine and imperative cause of the Master, is in itself ineffable. But while it \nsurpasses all description, it is something much more than an ornament of crowning glory \nfor those souls themselves. A visible memorial such as a tower, which symbolises their life \nof unfailing loyalty and love, can itself become a medium for inspiring the generations to \ncome. \n\"The memorial tower of my departed devotees - which is being erected on this spot - will be \na reservoir of inspiration and power for posterity. Their memory is not being perpetuated \nfor their sake; they had absolutely no desire for fame or name. But their memory is being \nperpetuated because it will be an example for those who are living, as well as for those who \nare to come. A life of sacrifice based on love is never lost. It is not only beautiful and fruitful \nin itself, but also in the creative inspiration which it leaves behind itself. \n\"The foundation of this tower is being laid on the tomb of my loved Masaji, with the bedding \nof one of my loved disciples, F. H. Dadachanji, whose selfless service to my cause was \nwholehearted in its devotion, and singular in its attainments. There are also others, such as \nBuasaheb, Munshiji, Sampath Aiyangar, and so forth, who served my cause with \nunimpeachable integrity of character before dropping their physical body. For each one of \nthem, a separate flower is placed in the foundation of the tower; and the names of all of \nthem will be inscribed on the Tower of Glory which will be erected on this foundation. \n\"The symbolic representation of these departed souls through flowers dispenses with the \nseparative burial or cremation ceremonies which are prevalent in different societies. The \nplacing of all these flowers in the same foundation is intended to emphasise the truth that, \nthough the bodies of these devotees were different, they were all parts of one eternal and \nindivisible soul. The memorial tower has completely dispensed with the physical bodies of \ndeparted souls; for the physical body is only the illusory shadow of the soul. Those devotees \nwhose names are likely to be inscribed on this tower after their demise, will have free \nchoice in respect of disposal of their bodies after their demise. Their bodies may be buried \nor cremated, or disposed of at the Tower of Silence according to the rites of their respective \nreligions, or according to any desire expressed by them during their lifetime; and they shall \nbe represented on this memorial tower only by their names. \n\"The tower will be in memory of men belonging to different religions, and will, in fact, \nrepresent the fundamental unity of all the great world religions. All the great world \nreligions have, in their own way, revealed the same one truth, which I bring anew. This \nunity of all religions will be clearly emphasised by placing on the tower the emblems of all \nthe important religions of the world. The tower shall thus be a silent proclamation of the \nunity of all religions. The unshakeable peace of the life in eternity and the unfading glory of \nconscious divinity shall crown the souls which are represented by this memorial tower. \nThey are all eternally mine. I bless them all.\" \nMeher Baba, 23 December 1944, \nMeherabad, LM8 p2999-3001 \nBhau Kalchuri wrote: \n\"Then, according to Baba's wish, Adi read out the names of all the departed ones which \nBaba had listed a few days before. Sitting, Baba placed one rose after another in the \nfoundation as each name was called... While this was occurring, Baba's face radiated bliss...\" \n(LM8 p3001) \nBack to top",

When Jesus was \ncrucified, he did not die. He entered the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. On the third day, he \nagain became conscious of his body, and he traveled secretly in disguise eastward (with \nsome apostles) to India. This was called Jesus' resurrection.

His \nbody is buried in a cave near here.\" \n7 August 1929, Harvan, Kashmir, LM4 p1193 \nBaba and some of his followers visited St. Mark's Square at 11:30 am. Outside the church, \nBaba explained the church's architecture and its spiritual significance. He had them count \nand write down the number of pillars, domes and arches, which came out to exactly 120. \nBaba said, \n\"This church is one of the four great spiritual centers of Europe. The whole structure \ncorresponds to the Avatar's twelve disciples of the inner circle and 108 disciples of the \nouter circles. I was here as Jesus with two of my apostles one month before my crucifixion, \nand sat on the exact spot where St. Mark's was later built.\" \nBaba went into the church with the men, but the church rules barred the women from \nentering. \n18 August 1932, Venice, Italy, LM5 p1699 \nOn August 24, 1932, in Cairo, Egypt, Baba told Kaka and Chanji, \n\"The Coptic Church contains a cave where Mary and Joseph stayed after fleeing Herod. The \nreason why I came to Egypt is to visit this church.\" \nThey visited the Coptic Church the next day. Baba's face was radiant with joy as he walked \nthrough the church. He said, \"This is my dear old place,\" and explained that Jesus had come \nand stayed there with his apostles. Baba climbed down into the small, dark room of the \ncave. The church warden did not want to open it, but Baba insisted and he finally agreed. \nThey were told that the church had been erected over the cave 930 years after Christ. \nLM5 p1705 \nOn April 20, 1933, Baba took a group of his followers to Harvan village in two buses and a \ncar. Dressed in disguise so as not to be recognised by the villagers, Baba showed them \nwhere he stayed in seclusion and fasted in 1929. Pointing to a hill, Baba said, \n\"There is the place where two of Christ's apostles, Bartholomew and Thaddeus, buried his \nbody. They had accompanied him from Palestine.\" \nLM5 p1770 \n\"An indescribable peace hung about Harvan. One felt like speaking only in whispers. Why \nhad Baba made a point of taking us to this spot? It was here, on the slope of the mountain, \nthat he had once been in seclusion and on fast for several months. The very same mountain \nwhere, Baba told us, Christ's body was buried. 'Although there is a tradition that he was \nburied at Harvan,' Elizabeth recorded in her journal, 'no one knows the exact spot except \nBaba.

    "text": "SATAN \nBook Two \n\"Love is God. Lust is Satan.\" \nMeher Baba, 1920s? T p56, also ST p.113 \nQ. Will Shri Meher Baba explain Christ's words concerning the Second Coming? \n\"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or, lo, he is there, believe him not... \nBut in those days, after that tribulation... then shall they see the Son of man coming in the \nclouds with great power and glory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather \ntogether his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost \npart of heaven.\" (Gospel of St. Mark 13: 21, 26, 27) \nBaba: The gathering of the elect refers to the reincarnation and final assembling of his close \ndisciples and followers at the time of his second coming. \nIt is wrong to associate the second coming with the imprisonment of the devil and a \nthousand years' peace, or with a literal interpretation of the last day of judgment. \nAll the great mystics have understood the word 'clouds' as a symbolic expression for states \nof consciousness or spiritual planes. When the Christ descends from the infinite, the seventh \nplane, he brings with him to earth the infinite goodness, wisdom, power and love, and also \nthe powers, signs and experiences of the six lower planes. \nIn the words of a great Sufi saint, \nAsman o Abro dunya basta been \nAvvalin Haq bad manzil pus zamin \n\"Behold the sky, the clouds and the world. \nFirst is God, then the planes, the last is earth, \nbut all three are linked.\" \nWe read in St. Mark 9:2 and 7, that the transfiguration of Jesus occurred when he ascended \ninto a mountain: \n\"And there was a cloud that overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying \n'This is my beloved son, hear him.'\" \nBrother Leo relates of the vision of St. Francis in Mount Alvernia that he \"saw coming down \nfrom heaven a torch of flame exceeding beautiful and light, which, descending, rested on the \nhead of St. Francis; and out of the flame there came a voice...\" \nSt. Francis explains to Brother Leo, \"Then I was in a light of contemplation, in which I saw \nthe abyss of the infinite goodness and wisdom and power of God... And in the flame that \nthou sawest was God, who also spake in such a manner unto me, even as in old time he had \nappeared unto Moses.\" \nOn Mount Sinai God appeared in a thick cloud and with fire. \nTherefore we see that clouds, the house of clouds (manzil), is a symbolic expression among \nmystics for the six planes. \nbefore 1933? QA p10-11 \n\"The truth is that Jesus was not tempted by Satan, but that Jesus got himself tempted, and he \novercame the temptations. There was a great purpose behind this. He had to get himself \ntempted. Thereby he shouldered the burden of the forces of temptations that predominated \nin the world. Jesus then overcame all the temptations, and in that way created a tremendous \nforce which acted as a great setback to the forces of universal temptations. \n\"The same was true in the case of Buddha, and it is the same every time in Avataric periods. \nWhenever God manifests on Earth as Avatar, his Godhood gives a universal push, and the \nresult is universal, i.e., not only the humanity reaps the benefit, but everything in the whole \ncreation reaps the benefit of the universal push.\" \nMeher Baba, 1955? GS p68 \n\"Good as well as evil are impressional products of the evolutionary momentum. They come \ninto conflict with each other, and as such are to be recognised as separate groups of forces. \nSatan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, each in his own way symbolises the forces of evil. However, it is a \nmistake to think that evil is an irreducible active force by itself. Both good and evil are \nabstractions, and have to be seen in their true perspective as inevitable phases in the \nsubhuman and human evolution. \n\"Evil is the lingering relic of earlier good. Some impressional tendencies, which were \nnecessary and inevitable at a particular phase, are carried over to the higher phase of \nevolution, and they persist in their existence due to inertia. They hinder harmonious \nfunctioning in the new context, and appear as evil. \n\"Good as well as evil have an undeniable relationship with the circumstances. No judgement \ncan be passed on the goodness or other aspect of any action without considering the \nconcrete context in which the judgement is called for. An act which is normally undeniably \nevil may, under special circumstances, be not only defensible but praiseworthy. \n\"Take for example the following exceptional case. Suppose a mother has given birth to a \nbaby and has not her own milk to feed it. The baby has to be fed on cow's milk, which is very \ndifficult to obtain. A neighbor may have some cow's milk, but the mother knows that he will \nnot part with it for money or for any philanthropic consideration, even though he does not \nneed it himself. Under such circumstances, if a person steals the cow's milk and feeds it to \nthe newborn baby in order to keep it alive, the act of stealing is in this case not only \njustifiable but definitely good. \n\"Of course an exception of this type does not make stealing a good act under all \ncircumstances. Normally stealing continues to be evil, but in the exceptional case above it \nhas become good. The illustration proves how considerations of good or evil must, in their \nvery nature, be dependent upon circumstances in all the variety of detail which obtains in \nconcrete situations. Good is relative to a concrete context of actual circumstances, and so is \nevil. But for many practical purposes certain trends of action have to be classified as good, \nwhile other trends of action have to be classified as evil. \n\"Everything happens according to divine will, and it is a mistake to think that God has a rival \nin the form of a devil. Accentuation of the forces for good is necessary for releasing divine \nlife in its fulness. But evil itself often plays an important part in accentuating the forces for \ngood, and it becomes an inevitable shadow or counterpart of the good. Like other opposites \nof experience, good and evil are also, in a sense, opposites which have to be withstood and \ntranscended. One has to rise above the duality of good and evil, and accept life in its totality, \nin which they appear as abstractions. Life is to be seen and lived in its indivisible integrity. \n\"Nevertheless, there is an important factor in the opposites of good and evil. Evil is to all \nappearance the converse of good, yet at the same time it is capable of being converted into \ngood. Thus, generally speaking, the path lies from evil to good, and then from good to God, \nwho is beyond both good and evil. \n\"If any suffering comes to a Perfect Master or Avatar, it should not be interpreted as a \ntemporary victory of evil. It happens by divine will, and is a form of divine compassion. He \nvoluntarily takes upon himself the suffering of others in order to redeem those who are \nengulfed in gnawing cravings, unrelieved hatred and unabated jealousies.\" \n1956? Be p55-58 \n\"In the story of Adam and Eve, the creative relationship between Infinite Unconsciousness \nand the Nothing is... portrayed... \n\"Adam and Eve were created by God in the very beginning, and they lived together naked in \nParadise, Eden. \n\"In Paradise their life was harmonious, beautiful and blissful, and God, whom they had \nnever seen, cared for them in every way. \n\"But in turn, Adam and Eve had to obey one command: God forbade them to eat from a \ncertain tree in the garden. \n\"One day a snake came to Eve and convinced her to offer the forbidden fruit to Adam, which \nshe did. Adam hesitated, but Eve convinced him to eat the fruit. \n\"Adam ate the fruit, ate it all, and God, angry with them for disobeying,  for breaking his only \ncommand, threw them out of Paradise. \n\"Although it is claimed in Genesis that God threw Adam and Eve out of Paradise, the fact of \nthe matter is they came into creation out of sleep. Adam entered creation from the state of \nsleep because of his ignorance of his own nature. Because Adam was ignorant, the forbidden \nfruit from the Tree of Knowledge very much attracted him, though he hesitated at first. The \nforbidden fruit contained the knowledge of good and evil, the opposites. It contained \nconsciousness, the knowledge of consciousness and unconsciousness. \n\"The snake represents illusion, and illusion, though it is not real, is convincing. Illusion, \nwhich has no substance of its own, but to which the Nothing is very susceptible, is the snake \nwhich convinced Eve to tempt Adam... \n\"The fruit from the Tree of Knowledge represents the object that creates desire through \ntemptation, Eve's powers of seduction. \n\"Eden is the Beyond-Beyond state of God, the original state of everything (Adam, Eve and \nthe snake) latent before the beginning. \n\"Adam entered creation because of the desire created by tasting the fruit. The more he ate, \nthe more he desired to know himself. The taste of the fruit gave Adam knowledge of good \nand evil, meaning he knew the difference between being conscious and being unconscious. \nHe desired to be conscious, to know. \n\"In Meher Baba's book 'God Speaks' this desire in Adam to know himself is referred to as \nthe Original Whim (Lahar), 'Who am I?' God Speaks is dedicated to the snake, illusion, since \nwithout that snake Adam would not have become conscious. (That same snake is called by \nthe Hindus 'Shesh Nag.' \n\"Adam's being thrown out of Paradise indicates the force of the Whim, the force of the \nmovement of the whole creation. That force is called pasara - expansion - and it is \ncontinually spreading out, moving. \n\"Adam's purpose of coming into creation was to realise who he was, but he could not \nwithout desire  - and that desire is called sanskara. From that original desire to know came \ninnumerable desires, sanskaras, which make up the illusory consciousness of everyone and \neverything in creation. \n\"In the beginning Adam and Eve were naked, meaning they had no sanskaras. But without \nsanskaras there is no development of consciousness. Eve desired Adam, and Adam desired \nthe Fruit of Knowledge. Adam could not realise himself without the desire to know. The \nfruit was the cause of his desire for knowledge. As he ate and felt the grip of the sanskaras, \nhe desired more. It takes time to know the self in the long process of evolution, \nreincarnation and involution. The hesitation on Adam's part was the stirring in the ocean of \nthe Whim of desire before any manifestation occurred. \n\"In the Hebrew and Christian tradition, this story is told, that Adam was thrown out of \nParadise by a wrathful God after eating the fruit. But the meaning has been lost. Actually \ninfinite unconsciousness came out of the Beyond-Beyond and into creation because of its \nown desire - the desire to be conscious... In Islamic tradition the same story is told, but \nSatan enticed Adam (instead of Eve) to eat forbidden wheat, and so God threw Adam out of \nParadise. \n\"Adam is the first one, and it is he who realised himself as God first... Eve followed Adam out \nof the garden, she followed him because she was his shadow... When Eve said to Adam, 'Eat \nthis,' ... Adam... (was) deceived. But this deception is necessary to know knowledge as \nknowledge and ignorance as ignorance. \n\"... Christhood means occupying the throne of God the Father. Adam became Christ when he, \nthe first soul, ended his journey from unconsciousness in the Garden of Eden to infinite \nconsciousness in Paradise.\" \nFrom notes dictated by Meher Baba, 1967 \nMeherazad, NE p128-130, 138 \n\"The text of all four Gospels in modern language is rather corrupt, but less so than might be \nexpected. The text was undoubtably corrupted in transcription in the early centuries and \nlater, during our times, in translation. The original authentic text has not been preserved, \nbut if we compare the present translations with the existing older texts, Greek, Latin, and \nChurch-Slavonic, we notice a difference of quite a different character. \n\"The alterations and distortions are all similar to one another. Their psychological nature is \nalways identical, that is, in every case in which an alteration is noticed, it can be seen that \nthe translator or scribe did not understand the text; something was too difficult, too \nabstract for him. So he corrected it very slightly, adding one little word, and in this way \ngiving to the text in question a clear and logical meaning on the level of his own \nunderstanding.  This fact does not allow of the slightest doubt, and can be verified in the \nlater translations. \n\"The most interesting transformation of this kind has occurred with the devil. In many \npassages in the Gospels, where we are accustomed to meet him, he is entirely absent from \nthe early texts. In the Lord's Prayer, for instance, which has entered profoundly into the \nhabitual thought of the ordinary man, the words 'deliver us from evil' in the English and \nGerman translations correspond to the Greek and Latin texts; but in Church-Slavonic and \nRussian it is 'deliver us from the sly one.' In French (in some translations) it is 'mais dlivre \nnous du Malin,' and in Italian: 'ma liberaci dal maligno.' \n\"The difference between the first early Latin translation and the later translation edited by \nTheodore Beza (16th century) is very characteristic in this respect. In the first translation \nthe phrase reads, 'sed libera nos a malo,' but in the second, 'sed libera nos ab illo improbo'  \n('from the wicked one'). \n\"Speaking generally, the whole Gospel mythology has been very greatly altered. 'The Devil,' \nthat is, the slanderer or tempter, was in the original text simply a name or description which \ncould be applied to any 'slanderer' or 'tempter.' And it is possible to suppose that these \nnames were often used to designate the visible, deceptive, illusory, phenomenal world, \n'Maya.' But we are too much under the influence of mediaeval demonology. And it is difficult \nfor us to understand that in the New Testament there is no general idea of the devil. There is \nthe idea of evil, the idea of temptation, the idea of demons, the idea of the unclean spirit, the \nidea of the prince of demons; there is Satan who tempted Jesus; but all these ideas are \nseparate and distinct from one another, always allegorical and very far from the mediaeval \nconception of the Devil. \n\"In the fourth chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel, in the scene of the temptation in the \nwilderness, Christ says to the devil according to the Greek text, upane opisw mou, 'go after \nme,' and according to the Church-Slavonic text, 'follow me.' But in the Russian, English, \nFrench and Italian texts this is translated: 'Get thee hence, Satan.' \n\"In the ninth verse after this (Matt. 4.19) Christ says to the fishermen whom he found by the \nlake casting their nets, almost the same words: 'Go after me,' or 'follow me'; in Greek, deute \nopisw mou. \n\"This similarity in addressing the 'devil' who tempted Jesus, and the fishermen whom Jesus \ntook as his disciples and promised to make 'fishers of men,' must have a definite meaning. \nBut to the translator it of course looked an absurdity. Why should Christ wish the devil to \nfollow him? The result was the famous phrase, 'get thee hence, Satan.' Satan in this case \nsimply represented the visible, phenomenal world, which must not 'get hence' by any \nmeans, but must only serve the inner world, follow it, go behind it.\" \nP. D. Ouspensky, 'A New Model of the Universe' \n(1943 edition) p135-136 \n\"In the Christian world, Satan became a figure of monstrous evil, but in the Qu'ran - as in the \nJewish scriptures - he is a much more manageable character. In its account of his fall from \ngrace, the Qu'ran says that when God had created mankind, he commanded all the angels to \nbow before Adam, but the Shaitan (or Iblis, as he is often called, in an Arabisation of the \nGreek 'diabolos') refused and was cast out from the divine presence. The Qu'ran does not \nsee this as the primal, absolute sin, but indicates instead that Satan will be forgiven on the \nLast Day. Some Sufis even came to claim that Satan had loved God more than the other \nangels, because he had refused to honour a mere creature with an obeisance that was due to \nGod alone... \n\"Islam does not subscribe to the doctrine of the Fall in the Christian sense. It tells us that \nAdam did succumb to Satan's temptation, but this exercise of free will was seen by Muslims, \nas by most Jews, as a necessary stage of human development. Despite his sin, Adam became \nthe first of the great prophets, even though he was guilty of a 'satanic' slip, and the Shaitan \nnever became the destroyer of mankind.\" \nKaren Armstrong, 'Muhammad: A Biography \nof the Prophet,' 1992, p114 \nMeher Baba used the name Shaitan for the 'Mischievous Chicken' in 'The Nothing and the \nEverything.' This Mischievous Chicken Shaitan represents the first soul to enter creation, \nthe first human, and the first soul to realise God, who comes as the Avatar again and again, \nage after age. \nSatan, the Devil, Beelzebub, Lucifer, Shaitan, are all personifications of maya, the principle of \nignorance.

When once \nrealised, this bliss is felt and enjoyed every second forever. \n\"From this comparison you can imagine the hollowness of the world and its pleasures.\" \nMeher Baba, 12 October 1922, \nBombay, LM2 p439. Also RD p104-105 \n\"At the Thursday afternoon tea-party at Kaka Shahane's, which was being continued every \nweek, Baba brought up the subject of 'vital forces' or 'vital fluid.' He said that the loss of this \n- excepting in the relations of man and wife which are based upon mutual love and respect - \nwas a serious matter. Indulgence for its own sake, whether natural or unnatural or in \ndreams, simply increased one's sanskaric load. \n\"'There are people,' he said, 'who say it is natural for the energies of the body to be spent. \nSpent, yes - but in service, not in lust. So the best remedy is to keep the mind engaged in \nlove for God and in service for others. \n'Without the rains, people would not get food or drink, but they must come at the right time, \nat the right place, in the right quantity; otherwise they may destroy the crops and flood the \ncountryside.'\" \nFrancis Brabazon, SW p269 \n(January 1926, Ahmednagar?) \n\"Desires are harmful both ways, when fulfilled and when not fulfilled. For instance, a person \nhas a desire for sex. Overcome with intense longing, he fornicates with someone of the \nopposite sex and fulfills his desire. What then? After the fornication, he feels dejected. Why \nis this, when his desire has been fulfilled? At first it seems so strange, but there is nothing \nstrange about it. For that is the eventual result of expression of his desire, which brings on \ndisappointment and dejection. \n\"Once a desire is fulfilled, there is another desire that arises ready to be satisfied. When that \ndesire is satisfied, another is there, and so on. It is not easy to escape the clutches of one's \ndesires. Only Perfect Masters can destroy the desires of their devotees, disciples, and those \non whom their grace descends.\" \nMeher Baba, 12 June 1929, Arangaon, LM4 p1165 \n\"fornication: voluntary sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons or two persons \nnot married to each other.\" (Random House Dictionary of the English Language) \n\"I must ask all aspirants to remember once and for all, that if they are desirous of rapid \nprogress and quick enlightenment, they should live up to the following four laws: \n1. If possible, observe celibacy. If already married, keep as little sexual intercourse with \nyour partner as possible. Consider, if you are a man, all other women as your sisters; if you \nare a woman, all other men as your brothers. \n2. Avoid all animal food, except milk and the products of milk. Don't partake of even eggs. \n3. Avoid all intoxicating drugs and drinks. Tea is not an intoxicant, provided it is weak. But \nbe moderate in your habit of tea drinking. \n4. Curb yourself, and never give way to anger. Whenever you fly into a passion, you contract \nred sanskaras, which are the worst of all.\" \nMeher Baba, Ms 2:2 p8 (February 1930) \n\"Wine is good for both health and the spiritual life. It is an intoxicant and tonic for both. If \nafter drinking wine, thoughts are diverted to spiritual advancement, it is a great push \ntoward the goal. Otherwise it can lead to hell. Wine is such that either it raises you to the \nhighest pinnacle, or makes you fall into the deepest ditch. \n\"The main object of intoxicants in the ancient past was spiritual. Seekers then used not only \nwine, but also hemp, heroin, hashish and opium; so much so that even Qutubs would \nindulge in them (You have heard stories that Sai Baba used to smoke a chillum pipe, and \nUpasani Maharaj smoked beedis). But eventually during those times, ordinary people \nindulged in these intoxicants for the wrong reasons. They could not understand their \nproper use, and the effects of the intoxication diverted their thoughts to carnal desires - \nworst of all to lust, the greatest obstacle in the Way. \n\"In the spiritual Path, lust is the greatest obstacle. Even the thought of fornication should \nnot enter the mind. That is why I tell you, 'Keep your langoti tight,' which means to have no \nlustful thoughts, do no lustful actions, and do not touch or even look at a woman. \n\"Lust is so forceful that even looking at a woman can start a man thinking about sex; and \nthinking leads to action. Compare the love between a child and his mother. The child plays \nin her arms and touches her without creating the least thought of lust. But the slightest \ntouch between the father and mother may arouse lustful thoughts in them.\" \nMeher Baba, September 1929, Isfahan, Persia \nto his men Mandali, LM4 p1227 \nlangoti = loincloth \n\"The intensity of lust has broken the penance and austerities of even rishis and munis.\" \nMeher Baba, 19 October 1929 \nIsfahan, Persia, LM4 p1231 \nBaba asked each of the unmarried men Mandali to promise never to touch any woman \nlustfully. He asked the married men Mandali to promise not to touch any woman other than \ntheir wives lustfully. Then he explained, \n\"Lust is not bad. Because of this lust, you have been born as human beings. It is due to this \nvery lust that you will turn from men into God. But even if lust is there in you, don't put it \ninto action. From the spiritual point of view, lust is the worst possible weakness. The real \nhero is he who successfully fights it. \n\"Fornicating with a woman who isn't your wife is one of the worst possible sins. What had \nto happen has happened; but from now on, beware of carnality. Follow my orders and stay \naway from lust. What lasting pleasure can one derive from such stinking parts? It can \ndestroy your spirit and character, as well as infect the body. \n\"I know each and every thing, but knowing everything, I keep on watching. Perhaps you \nmight think, 'Why doesn't Baba save us from committing sins, despite knowing everything?' \nBefore you do any wrong action, I already know that you are going to do it. Then why do I \nnot prevent you? It is my secret. \n\"The secret of my work is, though I know everything, I do not interfere. The fact is, you \nshould have this lust, but you should do your utmost not to fall prey to it. You should put up \na fierce fight, and though defeated a thousand times, you should again be ready to continue \nto fight the lust. \n\"Were I to wish it, I could destroy the lust in you in no time. But what would be the use of \ndestroying it? Inevitably I will destroy it. In the meantime, continue on with the battle inside \nyourselves. This is the law. It is necessary. Then joy will come in defeating lust. \n\"Without a struggle, there is no pleasure in fighting. The real pleasure lies in success after so \nmany defeats. Wars won without obstacles, without sacrifices and untiring effort afford no \npleasure. This should be a life and death fight. Lust is there to be fought. It is a lifelong \nstruggle. It will be a conflict in you till the end of your days. It should be there to fight you, \nand you should always be alert and ready for battle, to kill. \n\"He who has love for and faith in me will try doubly hard to obey me. If you touch any \nwoman, tell me immediately; this is one remedy. Another is to think that in your last birth \nyou were a woman and had connections with a man; now you are a man and you want \nconnections with a woman. You have had enough satisfaction in previous births. What is to \nbe had by more lust? \n\"Foremost you should try to get rid of lust, as all other vices are on account of it. For \ninstance, if a parrot's throat is cut, it dies. But if its wings are clipped, it does not die; after \nsome time the feathers of the wings grow back. Lust can be compared to the parrot's head. \nTherefore when lust is still present and we conquer other evils, such as anger, the evils \nagain revive - everything rises out of the head. But if lust is killed once and for all, every \nother evil is also destroyed. You have to cut off its head. \n\"Yet in truth, lust is necessary for evolution. It starts developing in the vegetable forms. \nWith the increase in lust, there is advancement in evolution, since lust means energy. And \nwith the increase in energy, consciousness expands. \n\"But these are points on this path which you will never understand. There are thousands of \npoints thinner than hair. Remember, it is no easy thing to eradicate sanskaras gathered \nduring birth after birth, and lust is the hardest of all sanskaras. But be heroes and fight lust; \nyou will defeat it. The real pleasure is to fight it and not succumb to it. Knowing this, I let it \nremain, but I will destroy it in you when the right time comes. Until then, go on fighting, and \nnever give up. \nMeher Baba, 19 October 1929, Isfahan, Persia \nto his men Mandali, LM4 p1232-1233 \n\"Sexual intercourse is the highest type of sensual pleasure in the world.

How ludicrous. Do any of you know why Muslims practice \ncircumcision? Muhammad told them to cut down and annihilate their minds, meaning to cut \nthrough maya and cut away their sanskaras. This means keeping one's own mind under \ncontrol and away from worldly thoughts. But failing to understand the true meaning of the \nProphet's teaching, some theologians concentrate upon the custom of circumcising children \n- a custom which people, without thinking, accepted and started to follow.\" \nMeher Baba, 22 June 1926, Meherabad, LM3 p817-818 \n\"Prophet Muhammad once told his chief apostle, Ali, 'If you want to know me, try your \nutmost to control your anger and transform it into love.' \n\"The very next day someone challenged Ali to a fight. Ali fought him and won. He brought \nthe man down and sat on his chest. \n\"The man spat right in Ali's face (the worst insult to a Muslim), and Ali got so angry he \nraised his dagger to kill him. But then Ali remembered what Muhammad had said, and so \ninstead he kissed him, and let him go. \n\"Now if he had not gotten angry, he would not have had the opportunity to control himself. \n\"That does not mean that you should go on kissing each other when you are angry. \nMeher Baba, 5 September 1940, Meherabad, LM7 p2607 \n\"Muhammad said, 'Keep engrossed in action alone. If you act well, you will go to heaven. If \nyou act evil, you will go to hell.'\" \nMeher Baba, 17 May 1943 \nMeherabad, LM8 p2887 \nFor a more complete version of this \nquote, see the chapter 'The Avatar' \n\"It is said that once Rasool-e-Khuda (the Messenger of God) felt indisposed, and someone \nsuggested that that was due to an evil eye, and that he should sleep on a pillow with an open \nknife underneath it. He did so, and thereafter declared himself to be all right. Call it ordinary \nor call it divine, it was Mohammad's sense of humor.\" \nMeher Baba, 4 November 1952, Meherabad, GGM3 p156 \n\"Let us take for example the stern discipline and fasts associated with Ramadan.* No doubt \nthey serve some spiritual purpose. But one way of looking upon it is to regard them as a sort \nof compulsory rationing of food and water in those areas where they were rare, and where \nsuch control was necessary in the interest of society. It is not necessary to convert the \ninstructions of the Prophet into inflexible and eternal rules of discipline. In the context in \nwhich they were given, they served both material and spiritual purpose. They cannot be \nregarded as inescapable or necessary in all times and climes. The same thing applies to any \nother disciplines given by other seers or Masters. \nThe Masters have sometimes followed external disciplines, including prayers, and have set \nan example of humility and readiness to learn from others. Thus Muhammad played the role \nof being taught by Gabriel. He thereby achieved two things. Firstly, he gave to the world an \nexample of readiness to learn from others. And secondly, he awakened the teacher in \nGabriel. \nMeher Baba, 1957? Be p73-74 \n*Ramadan = the ninth month in the Muslim calendar, when the faithful abstain from all \nfood, drink, tobacco and sexual intercourse from sunrise to sunset (alcohol is always \nforbidden in Islam). \nEDITOR'S NOTE: The Prophet Muhammad's full name was Muhammad ibn Abdulla. His \nfather was ABDULLA, his mother AMINA. He was brought up first by his grandfather ABD \nAL-MUTTALIB and later by his uncle ABU TALIB.  Muhammad was nicknamed AL-AMIN, \n'the Trustworthy.' At the age of 25 he married KHADIJA, who was fifteen years his senior. \nThey had four daughters, and two sons who died in infancy. Muhammad went into seclusion \nin a cave on Mount Hira, where, when he was 40, the Archangel JIBRIL (GABRIEL) appeared \nto him. Soon after he began his spiritual mission. Khadija died when Muhammad was 50. \nMuhammad married SAWDA BINT ZAMAH, AISHA, HAFSA, ZAYNAB BINT KHUZAIMA, \nZAYNAB BINT JAHSH, UMM SALAMA, MAIMUNA, JUWAQIRYA, and UMM HABIBA. His \nconcubines were SAFIYA, RAIHANA, and MARIYA THE COPT.* His daughters were ZAYNAB, \nRUQAYYA, UMM KULTHUM, and FATIMA. His sons QASIM, TAHIR, and IBRAHIM all died in \ntheir youth. The Archangel Jibril dictated the KORAN to Muhammad over a period of about \n22 years (610-622). WARAQA, ALI IBN ABU TALIB, ABU BAKR, ZAYD IBN HARITHA, UMAR, \nZAYD IBN TABIT and UTHMAN were among his disciple - companions. Muhammad is \nknown as RASOOL-E-KHUDA, the Messenger of God. \n*Safiya and Raihana, both Jews, may have been wives rather than concubines. \nBack to top",

    "text": "MANSUR AL HALLAJ \nGANJAY SHAKKAR (BABA FARID) \nMANSUR AL HALLAJ \n858-922 \n\"Although Baka is a Muhammadan term, and Muslim mystics or Sufis do interpret it as \nbecoming united with God, or as God seeing himself as he was in the beginning, as the stage \nof Anal Haq, i.e. 'I am God,' Baka is considered by the Muslims in general to be entering into \nGodly life, acquiring divine attributes and escaping from all that is worldly. \n\"It was because of this difference in the viewpoints of the masses and the Masters that when \nShah Mansur Bin Hallaj achieved Baka in the true sense of the word, and declared himself to \nbe God, he was put to death by the people in a very cruel way, on the ground that thereby \nMansur had violated the law or shariat. Mansur did trespass against the law of the masses \nby declaring himself God, but since Truth is beyond all the laws, Mansur was quite within \nhis rights to declare the fact that he has realised fully and completely. Needless to say that \nMansur submitted himself to the tortures of a horrible death, as many Masters have done, \nfor the sake of the masses themselves. \n\"Mansur could have convinced the people about the truth of his assertion, but in that case \nhe would have been compelled to divulge many spiritual secrets for which the time was not \nyet ripe. And yet in order to establish the fact among spiritually-minded Mussalmans that \nman could be God, he underwent physical death claiming Godhood to his last breath. \n\"Even at that time there were many spiritually advanced Muslim saints who knew through \npersonal experience that Mansur was speaking the truth, and some of whom had \nconsiderable influence over the masses. But still, in the interests of the people themselves, \nthey thought it proper to maintain silence, and some gave their tacit consent very \nreluctantly to the divine tragedy. \n\"More harm than good might have been the consequence of divulging great esoteric \nspiritual truths in the then condition of Arabia. It is probable that had they been divulged, \nArabia would again have become the home of debauchery, murder and atheism, which the \ngreat Prophet had taken pains to destroy. True, even long after Mansur's great sacrifice, \nsome notable Muslim Masters like Pirane Pir of Baghdad, maintained reticence over this \nquestion, but it was all, more or less, for similar reasons. But on the other hand, there is no \nlack of explicit confirmation of Mansur's claim by many eminent Qutubs. \n\"For instance, Ghous Ali Shah Qalandar, who was one of the Perfect Masters of his age, when \nquestioned by a disciple whether it was a fact that some Masters had said that, had they \nbeen present when Mansur was in the state of 'I am God,' they would have got him out of \nthis state, replied, \n\"Yes, but whoever said it never meant it... The state reached by Mansur was such that it had \ncompletely annihilated (the limited) Mansur, and as such there was nothing left for anybody \nto take out from this all-in-all state.\" \nMeher Baba, 1931? Ms 3:3 p7-8 \nBack to top \nGANJAY SHAKKAR (BABA FARID) \n1200-1280 \n\"The spiritual Path is not a bed of roses. After fourteen years of fasting, the great yogi Farid  \nShakkar Ganje had reached the fourth plane, but only knew how to kill sparrows. Once a \nSadguru was sitting in the shade of a tree observing him. Seeing the birds, Farid said, 'Let all \nthe sparrows drop dead.' Instantly all the sparrows were dead. Then Farid, by his command, \nmade them come alive again. The Sadguru taunted him: 'That is nothing. Learn Fakiri - \ncontrol over yourself.' \n\"Once Farid found an old woman lowering a bucket into a well, and drawing it back up again \nempty. This happened several times, and he expressed his surprise. The old woman, who \nwas a saint on the fifth plane, replied, 'It is better than your commands of die and come \nalive.' Hearing this, Farid Ganje was awakened to the reality of his powers, and began \nsearching for a Master. He found one, and by the Master's grace, became a Perfect Master \nhimself.\" \n10 December 1928, Meherabad, LM3 p1126 \n\"Even those in the fifth plane find it difficult to keep away from Illumination. It is called the \nstate of Hairat in Sufism. When the soul sees the Infinite, it has Illumination. Now, to work in \nthe world for others, this soul must at times keep away from Illumination, but finds it very, \nvery difficult. \n\"One famous Wali (in the fifth plane) named Ganjay Shakkar found it very difficult to obey \nhis Master, the Khwaja of Ajmer. Then the Master turned the key. Five thieves who had \nstolen a lot came to where that Wali was staying. That Wali could not close his eyes. They \nwere always open, dazed, glassy. He would not eat. These thieves stood five paces away \nfrom the Wali. They sat down and began sharing their loot, and soon were quarreling \namong themselves. Then two of them killed the other three. Then these two took all the loot \nand were going away with it. They passed by where the Wali was sitting, and as soon as they \ncame near he regained normal consciousness. \n\"The moment he opened his eyes, he saw sparrows. He wanted to try his powers, and said, \n'O sparrows, die,' and the sparrows fell down dead. Then he said, 'O sparrows, rise up,' and \nthey rose. \n\"This is a very famous story in India. At Ajmer there is a very big tomb, and every year \nhundreds and thousands go there on pilgrimage. \n\"The two thieves were amazed, and asked the Wali to raise the other three. The Wali said, \n'Rise up,' and they wouldn't. Then he went, crying and repentant, to his Master. When he \nwent there, he saw the three thieves massaging the feet of the Master. \n\"The Wali went back to his original place. For ten years he did not eat or drink, and became \nvery lean, and white ants were eating his body up. People came every day and placed sugar \naround his body, and the ants used to eat the sugar. From that time on, the Wali was named \nGanjay Shakkar, the Treasury of Sugar, and whenever people go to his tomb, they take sugar \nwith them. \n\"So even in the fifth plane, one finds it difficult, and the Master has to bring it around in this \nway. And the fun of it all is that till one attains the seventh plane of consciousness, it is all \nillusion. Just as all this appears real, in the same way, up to the sixth plane it appears real, \nbut it is not real.\" \n26 December 1936, Nasik, Aw 16:2 p16-17 \nAnother version: Di (7th ed.) p 198-199 \nBack to top",

Such a one's heart and soul are \ndedicated to the service and thoughts of God alone... \n\"Hafez was spiritually inclined from an early age, and became the disciple of a Perfect \nMaster, Attar, who himself was a great Persian poet. \n\"Hafez visited Attar every day for many, many years. He wrote ghazals and recited them to \nhis Master. Attar enjoyed these ghazals and gave them to his other disciples to study and \nbenefit by them, saying that Hafez's ghazals would be of the utmost importance to the future \ngenerations. \n\"Hafez himself did not bother to preserve his poems, and it was only after his death that \nthey were collected and put together as a Diwan (treasury or collection). \n\"One day, while he was still a youth, Hafez saw a very beautiful woman who came from a \nwealthy family. He instantly fell in love with her - not in the lustful way, but he fell in love \nwith her beauty, as it were. Because of the difference in their positions, he could not \napproach her. Yet he remained intensely in love with this woman for thirty years. He loved \nhis Master, Attar, greatly too, and hoped that Attar would help him in attaining the \ncompanionship of the woman. \n\"One day Attar asked Hafez, 'Tell my what you desire.' Hafez said he wanted the woman. \nAttar replied, 'Have patience. You will get her.' \n\"But almost ten years more passed by, and Hafez was no nearer having his longing fulfilled. \nHe became utterly disheartened. When alone with Attar one day, he began to weep. When \nthe Master asked him why he was crying, Hafez in his desperation blazed out, 'What have I \ngained after being with you for nearly forty years?' \n(I think Hafez meant that he had obtained neither God nor the woman he loved.) \n\"Attar answered, 'Have patience. You will know one day.' \n\"Hafez retorted, 'I knew I would get this answer from you.' And exactly forty days before the \nend of his forty years association with Attar, Hafez entered into self-imposed Chehel-a-\nNashini. \n\"Chehel-a-Nashini means drawing a circle on the ground and sitting within it continually for \nforty days. (One who succeeds in going through the Chehel-a-Nashini is supposed to attain \nwhatever he desires). \n\"It is almost impossible to to stay for forty days within the limits of a circle without once \nstepping outside it. But Hafez's love was so great that it made it possible for him to go \nthrough this Chehel-a-Nashini without faltering. \n\"On the fortieth day his Master appeared to him in the form of an Angel. On seeing such \nbeauty, Hafez realised that the beauty of the woman he desired was as nothing in \ncomparison with this heavenly beauty. And when the Angel asked him what it was he \ndesired most, Hafez replied instantly that his only desire was to wait on the pleasure of his \nMaster's wish. \n\"Just before dawn broke on the last day, Hafez came out of his Chehel-a-Nashini and went to \nhis Master. His Master embraced him, and Hafez became God-realised... \n\"Now for a Perfect Master to write poetry, what is this, when the whole world is in his \nhands? But as Tukaram, a Hindu Perfect Master who was also a great poet, explained, one's \noriginal nature (i.e. one's original tendencies, likes and dislikes) persist even after God-\nrealisation. So since Hafez was a poet before he attained God-realisation, he continued \nwriting poetry even afterwards.\" \nMeher Baba, 1960s? \n'Hafez' by Adi S. Irani \n'Happy Birthday' record sleeve, 1970s \nMeher Baba asked one of the Mandali to recite certain verses of Hafez in Persian. Baba said, \n\"These verses represent the foundation of Sufism.\" \nBaba translated the verses into English: \nO ignorant one, try, so that one day you become Master of wisdom. \nUnless you yourself have traversed the Path, how can you guide others? \nIn the divine school, in the presence of the Perfect Master, O son, try, try, try to obey, so that \none day you may also become the Father. \nLike the brave men on the Path, wash off from your hands this copper-like existence, so that \none day you gain the alchemy of love and become gold. \nWants of the body - sleep and food - have kept you away from the threshold of love. You will \nattain union with the beloved whe you become free from all wants. \nBaba commented: \n\"It is very difficult to be without wants. I want to sleep, I want to eat - these are wants. I do \nnot want to sleep or to eat - this also is a want. It is therefore rather impossible to be \nwithout wants. What then is the solution? Hafez provides one. Hafez says: \nOnly the grace of the Perfect Master can make you free from all wants. \nEven if a wee bit of the effulgent glory of God were to be revealed to you, you will become \nmillions of times brighter than the Earth's Sun. \nOne slight moment, if you have the fortune to drown yourself in the ocean of love, do not \nhesitate. That moment does not come frequently. \nAs soon as the Master says 'Drown,`' do not hesitate. Drown the moment the Master \ncommands you to drown. \nDon't worry about what the world will think of you. The world will call you mad, but you \nshould not hesitate. \nEven if one hair of yours is dipped in the ocean of love, you become wet eternally. \nIn that bliss of union with the beloved that you enjoy, there is no break - it is continuous. \nFrom head to foot you become God, if you, in this Path, become footless and headless. \nBaba continued, \n\"How to become footless and headless? Do whatever I tell you. Do not use your mind. When \nthe will of the beloved Master becomes your will, then you are footless and headless. \n\"Yet all this is impossible. Even the very desire for union with the beloved God is madness. \nSo there remains only one solution, and that is to become the very dust at the feet of the \nPerfect Master.\" \n14 April 1960, Poona, Gl Nov. 1973 p15 \nAnother version: Da p7-10 \nBack to top",

    "text": "JIDDU KRISHNAMURTI \nPaul Brunton met Meher Baba in November 1929 in India. He wrote that he asked Baba \n\"There are other claimants to messiahship?\" and that Baba answered: \"Yes. There is \nKrishnamurti, Mrs. Besant's  protege. The Theosophists deceive themselves. Their chief \nwire-pullers are supposed to be somewhere on the Himalayas in  Tibet. You will find \nnothing but dust and stones in their supposed abodes. Besides, no real teacher ever \nrequired someone else's body to be prepared and trained for his use.\" \nPaul Brunton, A SEARCH IN \nSECRET INDIA, 1935, p60 \nPaul Brunton (Raphael Hurst) wrote an account of his meetings with Baba, apparently with \nthe intent to defame him. The quote above appears to have been made up from Baba's \nearlier (1925) statement (SW p262-263), which Brunton may have read in the diaries Baba \nhad given him to look through. \nBrunton had come under the influence of K.J. Dastur, a disciple of Meher Baba who had left \nand denounced him. Brunton's quotations of Baba (including the quote above) are at best \nuntrustworthy. Baba did not allow him to take notes when they spoke. \nBrunton was also, apparently, the author of several articles about Baba published in the \nEnglish magazine John Bull in 1932. Margaret Craske asked Baba who had written in John \nBull. He replied, \n\"Since you want to know, I will tell you. It is Raphael Hurst (Paul Brunton). He is creating \nopposition against me in London. The poor chap is to be pitied; we should pity him rather \nthan blame him. Unknowingly, he has been made an instrument of K.J. Dastur's in India. He \nis unaware of the real situation, inner details and aim. Dastur is the cause of all this \nanimosity... \n\"That ignorant man, Paul Brunton, has been made a fool and a tool by Dastur. Brunton has \nbeen to India, stayed in Nasik, and has observed things with his own eyes. When he sought \nmy advice, I told him to go on a pilgrimage to certain places in India. He did not do that, and \ncoming under the influence of Dastur, he has commenced spreading lies about me here. This \nis the result...\" \n(May 1932, LM5 p1609-1610) \n(For more about Paul Brunton, see Book Three: Footnotes, and 'My Father's Guru: A Journey \nThrough Spirituality and Disillusion' by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, 1993.) \nMalcom Schloss wrote to Krishnamurti in September 1931, telling him Meher Baba was \nabout to come to  America. Krishnamurti wrote him back from Holland October 1st, \nthanking Malcolm, said he would very much like to meet Baba in  America, and conveyed his \ngreetings to Baba. Later, after Baba left America, Malcolm sent Krishnamurti several press \nclippings about Baba's visit and suggested Krishnamurti write Baba in  India. Krishnamurti \nwrote him March 18, 1932 from  Ojai, California, \n\"It is very good of you to have sent me the newspaper articles regarding Meher Baba. I do \nnot see how I can write to him as I have nothing to say to him, but I hope I shall meet him \nsome time, either in India or Europe. I hope you understand that it is not rudeness on my \npart not to correspond with him, but I really have nothing to say. After meeting in person, \nperhaps we can correspond together.\" \n(LM4 p1469) \nNorina Matchabelli told Rom Landau, a writer who met both Meher Baba and Krishnamurti, \nthat Baba said Krishnamurti possessed great possibilities within himself, was on the right \npath, but would not fulfill himself or become truly great until he came to see him. \n(LM4 p1469 and 'God is My Adventure' by Rom Landau) \n\"...While in Santa Barbara, we monitored over to see Krishnamurti at Ojai Valley. Norina \nknew him previously, and had a good talk with him. He said it would be a privilege to meet \nyou.*\" \nElizabeth Patterson, letter to Meher Baba, 1944, LM8 p2954 \n*If Krishnamurti did eventually meet Meher Baba, the meeting has not been recorded. \nFilis Frederick wrote that Meher Baba said Krishnamurti was on the fifth plane. \n\"One can smile at Norina's naivete about whom to bring to Baba, but it is interesting to note, \nfirst, Baba gave in to her whims; and second, how lucky these people were to meet him, \nready or not. Sometimes he refused. For example, in India, she begged Baba to meet \nKrishnamurti, (he once was acclaimed as Avatar of the age by the Theosophists, a position \nhe wisely repudiated). Baba said, 'Leave him alone. He is on the fifth plane, and will stay \nthere until he dies.' \n(Aw 20:2 p17) \nA soul on the fifth plane who acts as a spiritual master is called a Wali. Baba explained, \n\"Walis and Pirs of the fifth and sixth plane can raise you to a higher state with just one look. \nBut that is not the Perfect state, as these advanced souls are not Perfect. At times, even \nPerfect Masters cannot help those caught in these nets. Therefore, except for the Perfect \nOnes, do not even be beguiled by the advanced souls of the fifth and sixth planes. \n\"Stick to the Emperor and don't leave him for any reason. I am in everyone. But if you catch \nhold of me, you will have the root of all creation in your hands. Then you will not need to go \nafter the branches and leaves.

If you get impatient, by \ndigging two feet here and four feet there, you will never strike water. If you only dig a \nshallow well, you will get impure water. Only patient, laborious digging will result in your \nfinding crystal-pure water. And for that, you have to exert energy and dig deep. \n\"This Path is not easy at all, and if you enter it, you will not find joy here. Therefore, I warn, \nthink seven times before entering it. If you are after God, you will have to give up everything \n- your father, your mother, the whole world. You have to renounce each and every thing. \nTherefore, ponder well, and then take your step. If not, leave this Path and attend to your \nworldly duties. \n\"Once you fall for the Path, don't be afraid of anything in the world. 'Who will look after my \nparents? How about my job?

    "text": "VISITING SAINTS AND MASTERS \nBook Two \nMeher Baba often warned those who followed him not to visit saints and masters, whether \nreal or false. He said that the great majority of spiritual teachers were false, and that it was \nvery hard to recognise the few who were real. Contact with even a real master, he said, \ncould be harmful to someone who already followed Meher Baba. Baba did not give the same \nadvice to those who did not follow him. \nOne of Meher Baba's followers, Vibhuti, lived several years with Baba at Meherabad, and \nthen went to Nasik. He began to tell people that he was Meher Baba's chief disciple, and \nwould instruct them to bow down to him. On February 7, 1927 Gopal Swamy came to \nMeherabad and told Baba what Vibhuti was doing. Baba commented, \n\"What earthly use is it misguiding and making others believe a person is a mahatma or \nsaint, when he is not really so? To be a Master, a person has to be one with God. He must be \nRealised. From the spiritual standpoint, it is a great sin and a crime to make people believe \none to be a guru or a Master when one has no experience. This is misleading people, and the \nworst possible fraud. \n\"A person should first be one with God and experience divinity; then it is appropriate to be \ncalled a Master. But to do so without experience is so great a sin that it is unimaginable. By \nsuch acts, a person is never able to realise the Truth, and however intense his desire for \nRealisation, it remains unfulfilled. Such acts isolate a person from his Master's sight and his \ngrace is then never acquired. On the contrary, he invites the Master's wrath upon himself, \nwhich in the end proves terrible for him. Such people should be cut to pieces.\" \nMeher Baba, 2 February 1927, Meherabad, LM3 p904 \nAnother version: \n\"What earthly use is it to make believe that one is a mahatma or guru or saint when one is \nnot? To lay claim to such a state and station one must be one with God. If one isn't, it is a \nvery great sin, a spiritual crime of the worst kind. First become the Dev (God), and then \nbecome a guru.\" \nSW p335 \nBaba told Minoo Pohowala, who was in the habit of visiting saints, \n'\"When you sink a well, you first select a spot before beginning the drilling. But if you stop \ndrilling halfway, and start anew at a different spot, you will never find water, and all your \nlabors will be wasted. \n\"But if you keep drilling at one spot, you will surely find water one day. A spirit of fortitude \nis required. If you are easily disappointed and keep trying at different places, you will never \nsucceed. \n\"Similarly, if you continue running from one saint or Sadguru to another, you will never gain \nanything. Stick firmly to only one Master and carry out his wishes. Dig, dig and keep on \ndigging, and one day you will get the water of Realisation.\" \n2 June 1928, Meherabad, LM3 p1051 \nBaba remarked about a group of sadhus and sanyasis, \n\"Look at them. They wear long hair, apply ash to their bodies, put on robes and give \nspiritual discourses. This is only an outward show; within, they are merged in maya. They \nare hypocrites. It is a sin to pretend that one is away from maya. \n\"These so-called sadhus are full of desires, and have thoughts of eating, drinking and \nwearing fine robes. Outwardly they show themselves to be sadhus, but inwardly they are \nquite the reverse. Only he who has annihilated himself is a real sadhu.\" \n13? May 1929, Rishikesh, LM4 p1157 \nBaba told Kaikhushru Pleader, who was in the habit of visiting saints and sadhus: \n\"Do not be after gatekeepers or watchmen. Catch hold of the Emperor. Never be after his \nservants. No minister or secretary will help. A king is, after all, a king, and his servants only \nservants. Once you have approached the king directly, it is of no benefit to maintain a \nfriendly attitude with his servants. Your friendship with the king might precipitate any \nsituation, but you should stick to him. Even if you were about to die, you should never let go \nof his hand. \n\"The Emperor is perfect knowledge. One should forget everyone and everything in his \ncompany. One should stop one's previous habits. One should not think of meditating or \nrepeating God's name, or any other type of worship. The most that could happen with any of \nthese practises is that you would enter samadhi. Such practises can never make you one \nwith God. \n\"Instead, one should submit oneself to the Emperor's will, having only this thought: 'O God, \nwhen will you meet me?' This longing must be present twenty-four hours a day. If the \nfeeling is intense enough, God will surely fulfill it. \n\"To help people is good, but service done under the guidance and according to the \ninstructions of a Perfect Master is the best. Service to half-baked gurus and false saints will \nthrow you into a gutter. You will be left hanging by those hypocrites. If you are unlucky \nenough to find a false guru, he will accept you and take you into his service. However, he \nwill then give you up, and that will cool down your longing! Instead of losing, you will \naccumulate sanskaras, and become disappointed and disgusted. \n\"These false saints cannot give you anything, while... Walis and Pirs of the fifth and sixth \nplane can raise you to a higher state with just one look. But that is not the Perfect state, as \nthese advanced souls are not Perfect. At times, even Perfect Masters cannot help those \ncaught in these nets. Therefore, except for the Perfect Ones, do not even be beguiled by the \nadvanced souls of the fifth and sixth planes. Stick to the Emperor and don't leave him for \nany reason. \n\"I am in everyone. But if you catch hold of me, you will have the root of all creation in your \nhands. Then you will not need to go after the branches and leaves. If you are lucky enough \nto catch hold of the Emperor, you should never, never leave him. \n\"Go on digging until you find water. Don't keep changing the spot. If you get impatient, by \ndigging two feet here and four feet there, you will never strike water. If you only dig a \nshallow well, you will get impure water.

Stop looking elsewhere, and look only at the ocean. By \nconcentrating on me, you yourself will become the ocean. To look at the ocean means to \ncarry out my wishes at all times.\" \nMeher Baba, 6 September 1929, Bombay \nto Kaikhushru Pleader, LM4 p1215-1216 \nCharles Norwood: What is your opinion of the Theosophists Annie Besant and Charles \nLeadbeater? \nBaba: They have done some good work, but there is still much to be done. They are \nsomewhat advanced souls. But at a certain stage of advancement, without the guidance and \nhelp of a Master, hostile forces are created, resulting in delusion. It all becomes a jumble, \nand there is confusion. \n24 November 1931, New York, LM4 p1488 \nQ. Do you believe that ________ was an initiate? \nBaba: How can I speak against anyone when I find the infinite in everyone? But why bother \nabout names? You can be an initiate yourself. The same infinite is within you as within any \ninitiate. \n1930s, Europe, PM p251 \n\"There are many on the Path who become self-deluded, and think they have reached the \ngoal, and say 'I am God.' They are not charlatans, but self-deluded. They believe it genuinely, \nbut when the time comes, it goes. Then they perceive it was a delusion. This is called \nMukama Fasana, i.e., the Abode of Delusion.\" \nMeher Baba, 9 January 1937, Nasik, Aw 16:2 p19 \n\"The work of the God-man in the universe is fundamentally different from the kind of thing \non which most of the priests set their hearts. \n\"Most of the priests of established religions attach too much importance to external forms, \nrituals and conformity. And since they are not themselves free from selfishness, narrowness \nor ignorance, they exploit the weak and credulous by holding before them the fear of hell or \nthe hope of heaven. \n\"The God-man, on the other hand, has entered forever into the eternal life of love, purity, \nuniversality and understanding. And he is therefore concerned only with the things that \nreally matter, and which eventually bring about the inner unfoldment of the spirit in all \nwhom he helps. \n\"Those who are themselves in ignorance, may, out of self-delusion or deliberate selfishness, \nuse the same language as that of the God-man. And they might try to imitate the God-man in \nmany of the external things associated with the life of the God-man. But they cannot, by the \nvery nature of their spiritual limitations, really imitate the God-man in possessing perfect \nunderstanding, experiencing infinite bliss, or wielding unlimited power. These attributes \nbelong to the God-man by virtue of his having attained unity with God. \n\"Those who are in ignorance lack fundamental traits of The God-man. And if, out of self-\ndelusion or hypocrisy, they try to pose as the God-man, their self-delusion or pretense is \ninvariably exposed at some time. \n\"If a person gets committed to a line of life out of self-delusion, it is an unfortunate case. He \nbelieves himself to be what he is not, and thinks that he knows when he actually does not \nknow. But since he is sincere in all that he thinks or does, he is not to be blamed, though he \ncan become a source of danger to others to a limited extent. \n\"The hypocrite knows that he does not know, and pretends to be what he is not for selfish \nreasons. But in doing so he creates a serious karmic binding for himself. And though he is a \nsource of considerable danger to the weak and the credulous, he cannot go on indefinitely \nwith his willfull deceit. For in the course of time he gets automatically exposed for a claim \nwhich he is unable to substantiate.\" \nMeher Baba, 1941? India, Di v4 p20-21 \nAnother version: Aw 2:1 p29-30 \n\"Most masts and saints do not know me as the Avatar, but only recognise me according to \ntheir station. They do not see beyond where they are - beyond their state of advancement.\" \nMeher Baba, November 1944, Ajanta, LM8 p2982 \n\"At present, in the East and West, there are about seventy people who claim to be the \nAvatar. But I tell you, Bal, I am the real one.\" \nMeher Baba, to Bal Natu, 10 May 1954 \nMahabaleshwar, GG6 p43 \n\"I have to come again and again in flesh and blood to bear the sufferings of humanity... \n\"I want to tell you one important thing which each of you must remember well. It is a fact \nthat I am the Lord of the universe. I am omnipresent... \n\"I have come to make the whole world mad after love and truth. Only the Avatar, whenever \nhe lives amidst mankind, has to undergo humiliation. When there are five Perfect Masters \nwho are God personified and who control and look after the affairs of the universe, what \nneed is there for them to precipitate the incarnation of God on earth? They bring him down \nto shoulder the sufferings of humanity. The five Perfect Masters are not as much vilified or \nhumiliated as the Avatar is. I have been made to take this human form by the five Perfect \nMasters of this age to bear the cross and to undergo humiliation... \n\"I will start with the topic of saints... To say whether a saint is real or an imitation one is my \nright alone and not yours.\" \nQ. Baba, we go to saints because we have a feeling that you are in everyone. \nBaba: I am also in a thief and a murderer. Then what is it that prevents you from respecting \nand worshipping them? If you were really to see me everywhere as I am, there would not \narise any need for you to go to saints, or even to come to me to pay your respects. \nI have been saying all the time, age after age, that when I, the Ancient One, assume this \nhuman form, there are many false prophets who claim themselves as Avatars. For instance, \na week ago I received a letter from Uttar Pradesh, from a devotee who writes that there are \ntwo persons in his town, and each proclaims himself as the Avatar of the age. This created a \ngreat deal of confusion in his mind. Also, in one of the towns of northern India, there is one \nsocial worker who claims, and has a genuine feeling for his claim, that he is the Avatar. I am \ntelling you these things in detail for it is my right alone to say so, as all of them are my \nchildren. \nAs far as you are concerned, you should neither criticise nor indulge in backbiting. If you \nspeak ill of a real saint, it will be harmful to you. You will create dreadful (sanskaric) \nblunders. You should avoid vilifying even the so-called 'mahatmas' who call themselves \nsaints, because it is not possible for you to be certain whether they are real or not. The \npresumptuous saints outwardly act like real saints. You will not be able to differentiate \nbetween them, just in the same way as you would not be able to differentiate between the \nmasts and mad persons. Yet what a world of difference lies in their inner states! \n... I would like you to know that to become a saint is not child's play. The very word saint, \nwhen commonly used or made applicable to anyone, creates a lot of misunderstanding. I \nwill tell you something that will clarify the misunderstandings regarding saints. There are \ntwo types of saints: real saints, and imitation saints. Just as an ordinary person cannot \ndistinguish between a real and an imitation pearl, you cannot distinguish between a real \nsaint and an imitation saint. I alone, like a jeweller, can make out the difference. \nParticularly in India, we find a lot of imitation saints, and this is due to the superficial study \nof Vedanta. By studying Vedanta, one can say 'I am God.' Sadgurus also say 'I am God.' \nImitation saints say the same thing, but with the help of Vedanta. Real saints need no such \nhelp; they say what they experience. There are also some who, after reading Vedanta, \nrealise that they have no such experience, but they still say \"I am God.' This is hypocrisy. \nAlso there are some imitation saints who, after reading Vedanta, have a genuine feeling and \nsay 'I am God,' though in reality they do not have any conscious experience. \nIf anyone confers greatness on you and begins to worship you, you know yourself that you \ndo not deserve it. At the outset you are tempted to accept this greatness, which makes you \nfeel happy. But your conscience will be constantly pricking you, and you will be always in a \nstate of anxiety about future developments. You will be frequently in a fix whether to accept \nor reject the greatness which is thrust on you. \nOnce you accept this conferred greatness, it becomes very difficult for you to get out of the \nsituation. After a time, even the pricks of conscience cease troubling you, for you get used to \nthem. Then it becomes an addiction, and  you cannot do without it. You then pose as a real \nsaint. This posing will cause you to take innumerable additional births. So why pose as a \nsaint without inner experience? \nAs for myself, I say I am the highest of the high. Had I not been the ancient one, I would have \nencouraged you to visit the so-called saints. I would have even praised them, and they too \nwould have praised me in return. Thus a clique would be formed that would promote \nmutual praise to dupe the public. \nIf any one of you meets an imitation saint or an imitation Avatar, what would he say to you? \nHe would say the same thing as I. If you tell him that Baba is the Avatar, he may even say, 'I \nam the real one, and that Baba is a fraud!' \nWhen anyone approaches an imitation saint and is attracted by the outward atmosphere \nwhich he creates around him, and if, owing to his faith in the imitation saint, he gets \nexperiences, he is likely to attribute them to that imitation saint. This creates confusion. \nNow I will tell you about an incident. During my recent visit to America, a gentleman, who \nhas been staying in America for a long time, remained by my side during some of my \nprograms, and particularly when the films and photographs were being taken. This \ngentleman has studied and intellectually grasped what I have said, but misused it. From one \nof the letters from the U.S.A., I hear that this gentleman has started telling people that he is \nBaba's representative. Those who know me for so many years are not affected. But the new \nlovers, though educated, are very much impressed and flock around him. Just see how even \nthe Westerners are misled. \nWhat is the remedy for this? I will tell it now. It will be very useful only if you grasp it \nthoroughly. If all of you are convinced that Baba is the Avatar, God incarnate, the question of \nconfusion does not arise at all. In this case, just hold fast to my damaan (the hem of the \nMaster's robe) and close all doors for confusion and conflict to enter your minds. If you are \nnot convinced, leave me. Seek someone else. But if you try to stick to me with a wavering \nmind, without being convinced of my divinity, you will be just like a nut caught in the \ncrusher. \nI will also tell you a few instances of those who pay too much attention to masts, though \nthey have been connected with me for so many years. One of them went to the extent of \ndrinking wine whenever offered by a mast. The other used to carry a certain mast on his \nshoulders to his home and serve him daily. Had I not warned them in time, they would have \ngot themselves involved seriously. When God himself has descended on the earth, and you \nhave the good fortune to come in personal contact with him, why run after his children, the \nmasts and the saints? \nIn Uttar Pradesh and the Punjab, there are saints of both types, real and imitation. There, \nmen put up a big show of spirituality by performing homa-haven, bhajan-kirtan, yadna-\nyagna, arti-puja, etc. From external appearances one cannot make out who is a real saint \nand who is an imitation one. Anyone is easily impressed by the so-called outward spiritual \natmosphere. \nYou do not find these things here with me. On the other hand, you find me sitting among \nyou, sometimes telling jokes and letting you laugh. The real Path is totally different from the \nconventional bhajan-kirtan, etc. On the contrary, when one gets entangled in these rituals \nand ceremonies, one gets off the real Path. \nWhen I tell you these things and ask you not to visit saints, perhaps some of you may think, \n'Is Baba feeling jealous of others?' But I, being one without a second, have no rival. I am \nmatchless. Being the one reality, the question of rivalry does not arise for me at all. If I am to \nbe jealous at all, I will have to be jealous of my own self. \nWhen a man sees an ant moving on the ground, will he ever feel jealous of it? Both the ant \nand the man move on a level on the ground. But there is a world of difference in their \nconsciousness. The ant can never understand the intricacies of this machine age. The ant, \nthe ordinary man and myself move on the same land, but there is as much difference \nbetween the consciousness of an ordinary man and mine as there is between the \nconsciousness of an ant and that of an ordinary man. Even in the animal kingdom, there is \nvast difference between the consciousness of an ant and an elephant. Has the elephant ever \npurposely walked over an ant feeling jealous of it? \n... I do not mean that there are no real saints in India. (Baba mentioned a few well-known \nsaints) There are also some real saints unknown to the masses. Compared to the known \nsaints, these hidden saints are far more advanced. In this respect, however, I want to tell \nyou with authority that both the hidden and the known saints have not realised the Self. Do \nnot be misled by the use of certain words and phrases. If anyone addresses you as 'dear \nSelf,' do not be under the impression that he has achieved the goal of Realisation. \nThe sum and substance of this long talk is that you either hold fast to my damaan only, or \nleave me altogether. Do not make any compromise. \nHowever, you are free to visit and pay homage to the shrines of my five Perfect Masters: Sai \nBaba, Upasani Maharaj, Babajan, Tajuddin Baba and Narayan Maharaj. Of my five Perfect \nMasters, four do not have any representatives. Only Upasani Maharaj has a representative. \nShe is Godavari Mai. She has a very pure heart, and there is no equal to her in this respect. \nYou can go to Sakori and pay your respects to her. She is dear to me. She loves me very \nmuch. She is my beloved Yashoda. \nThis does not mean that my five Perfect Masters do not each have a Chargeman and a Circle. \nInvariably, without any exception, every Perfect Master must necessarily hand over his \ncharge to one whom he makes as Perfect as himself. Such a one is called the Chargeman of a \nPerfect Master. \nDo not visit other places or saints, as you cannot distinguish between a real saint and an \nimitation one. I also want you not to criticise or vilify anyone. If you happen to meet saints, \nreal or imitation, by chance, you may pay respects to them, but do not run after them. If you \nhave full faith in me, stick to me. Otherwise leave me now altogether. Who will hold on to \nmy damaan wholeheartedly to the end? \n(all those present raised their hands) \nQ. Baba, I tell others that you are the Avatar, but to be honest, I have no such conviction, \nthough I crave it very much. \nBaba: Have you come across anyone greater than myself? \nQ. No. \nBaba: Then why worry? Try to love me more and more. But remember one thing: never tell \nothers what you do not feel yourself. Tell others only what you honestly take me to be. I am \nanything and everything that one can honestly believe... \nIt is a fact that I am God. I am the highest of the high. I wish that those who raised their \nhands should hold fast to my damaan for good. There is no need for my lovers to visit saints. \nStick to me even during the phase of humiliation. Spread my message of love to all, and \nbecome like dust in Baba's work. \nMay 19 and June 7, 1957, Guruprasad Poona, Aw 5:4 p22-32 \n\"I am infinite consciousness, interpenetrating and transcending all states of limited \nconsciousness. The most primal and the most final categories of consciousness - say a stone \nor a saint - are equidistant from me. So I am equally approachable by all. I am the way.\" \nc.1960, EN p70 \n\"A saint is one who sees me as I really am. And seeing me as I really am means seeing \nnothing else but my effulgence continuously. He alone is on the sixth plane who sees my \nlight without pause or break. He who sees me as I really am is also my true lover, who is on \nthe sixth plane of involution of consciousness.\" \nAO p217 \nPart of a message Meher Baba sent by letter to T. Dhanapathy Rao, President of the Avatar  \nMeher  Baba  Andhra  Center in  Kakinada, on December 25, 1962, through Eruch Jessawala: \n\"My dear Dhanapathy Rao, \n\"Beloved Baba wants me to convey to you and to all his dear ones who played a prominent \npart to have the new set-up for Avatar Meher Baba Andhra Center as wished by him, that he \nis happy with what has been decided upon. Baba wants you, V.V. Narayana Rao, and the rest \nof his dear ones to know that next year is very important and critical from the point of view \nof his work, workers, and lovers, and as such, he wants Avatar Meher Baba Andhra Centre to \nremain ever vigilant, so that his lambs may not be devoured by wolves. This is what beloved \nBaba has been telling all his loved ones who have been burdened with the responsibilities of \nbeing group-heads of various Meher centres. \n\"Baba says that the time is such that his lovers should cling to his daaman under any \ncircumstances. There will be many a howling wolf distracting his poor and simple lambs, \ndonning the robes of sanctity and assuming the roles of saints, yogis, maharishis and \nmahatmas. Beloved Baba exhorts his loved ones to beware of such fakirs and fakes, for they \nwill abound on the face of the Earth ever more, and like mushrooms, spring up unseen and \nout of nowhere. Hence it is of utmost importance that his lovers and workers remain \nvigilant, and pay heed to his repeated warnings to beware of so-called saints, sadgurus, \nmunis, rishis, yogis, masts, fakirs, and above all, avatars of the yug!* \n\"... Baba sends his love blessing to you all. \nYours lovingly, \nEruch\" \nDV 2:2 p6-7 \n*yug: age \nThese false saints are fools who catch false-hearted lambs in their traps \nBe careful - keep away from the deadly traps of these false saints. \nHow many false masters abound these days in every lane. \nLover of God, never go to them, even in your dreams. \nFalse saints never kiss the dust. \nNo one should make them their master. \nMeher Baba, April-June 1968, India \nexerpts from ghazals 153, 160 and 161, 'Meher Sarod' \ntranslated by Bhau Kalchuri from Hindi \nThe following two letters were written by Eruch Jessawala, one of Meher Baba's Mandali, in \n1980 and 1981. \n\"Meherazad, 25th November 1980 \n\"Through the past decade since beloved Avatar Meher Baba dropped his physical form on \n31st January 1969, I have heard reports and received many letters from lovers of Avatar \nMeher Baba concerning the mushrooming of some self-appointed preceptors, guide, yogis, \nsaints and sadgurus, who now act as 'masters' to the followers of Avatar Meher Baba. \n\"In addition, there is an increasing confusion in the minds of Baba-lovers over the \nindispensable need for an aspirant to have a living Perfect Master as revealed by beloved \nBaba in the Discourses, as against beloved Baba's timeless warnings not to approach gurus. \n\"Lest silence from the Mandali of Avatar Meher Baba be misconstrued by Baba-lovers as \napproval for seeking gurus, I find it imperative to speak now, being prompted from deep \ndown within me to do so. \n\"Having spoken, it is left for each heart to heed the warning, or act as you would wish, but \nknow well that 'Whosoever has not the eye for the Sultan cannot go to the Sultan.' \n\"Our love for the God-man is the response to the greater love which he has for us. Through \nlifetimes of striving, longing and seeking comes the rare opportunity for a few to accept the \nadvent of the God-man, while millions upon millions are yet unaware that the expected one \nhas come again as Avatar Meher Baba. What untold fortune is our inheritance that beloved \nMeher Baba has drawn us to him - closer and yet closer into the orbit of his love. \n\"This circular letter is being issued in response to the written and verbal enquiries of people \nwho wish to love Meher Baba, and who are confused at Avatar Meher Baba's statements \nconcerning the need for a 'living Perfect Master,' as contrasted with his repeated injunctions \nagainst chasing after gurus. The statements that follow are from what I have gathered from \nbeloved Baba in my years with him, and are intended for all. \n\"For those firm in their love for Avatar Meher Baba, and whose only wish is to hold fast to \nhis daaman, the conflict regarding the need for a living Perfect Master does not exist. There \nis no conflict, because for them Meher Baba was, is, and remains the eternal Perfect Master, \neternally alive in their hearts. These people do not seek spiritual guidance, and are not \ninterested in spiritual progress, because they have firm faith and trust in beloved Meher \nBaba's continuing guidance, and they rely on him alone. Their only wish is to be completely \nresigned to his will, and to efface themselves in love for him. \n\"Beloved Avatar Meher Baba is veritably God in human form, as revealed to us by him. \nWhen he dropped his body on 31st January 1969, and passed away physically from our \nmidst, the Avatar did not 'die' - he simply dropped his man-form, to continue to remain as \nGod - the eternal presence in our midst. \n\"The Avatar, God manifest in human form, makes the inconceivable and unapproachable \nreality conceivable and approachable. God makes his being, his love, his compassion, his \ncharity, etc., more tangible to mankind when he is physically among us as the Avatar of the \nage. \n\"When we say that beloved Avatar Meher Baba dropped his body, we thereby mean that he \nwithdrew his man-form, and left in the hearts of his lovers the longing for his reality, by \nwhich one may see him as he really is. God is not 'dead' - rather he is no longer visible in \nthat man-form so dear to us all. He has not ceased being immanent and active. As Avatar \nMeher Baba withheld his voice so that we might hear his silence, he now withholds sight of \nhim so that we may seek him within ourselves, and by his grace find him as the only \nbeloved. \n\"Meher Baba revealed to us time and again that at the end of each avataric advent, his \navataric impact, influence or force, and the fragrance of his presence, continue to remain \nactive for 100 to 200 years, exactly as though he were physically present. If the next advent \nis to take place after 700 years, then his avataric impact, influence or force, and his divine \npresence of the advent, continue to be felt for 100 years and a little more. Similarly, if the \nadvent occurs after 1400 years, his impact and divine presence pervade for 200 years and a \nlittle more. \n\"The five Perfect Masters of the time precipitate the advent of the Avatar in our midst, and \nrelinquish their charge to him during each Avataric period, and then remain 'backstage' as \nthe Avatar shoulders their duties. They remain inactive during the avataric advent while he \nis in man-form, and for as long as the avataric impact or force continues to pervade. The \ndivine influence of the Avatar after he drops his physical body is in no way diminished or \ndifferent from when he was physically among us. \n\"Blessed is mankind during each advent, as each advent is the springtide of creation, when \nthe God-man is present among us. And doubly blessed is man when he becomes aware of \nthe Avatar's presence, and remains under the influence of the Avatar's love for him. When \nman learns to love the Avatar and continues to stay in the orbit of the love of the Avatar, it is \nredundant for him to go in search of a spiritual guide or a Perfect Master! The Avatar is for \nhim the eternal Perfect Master, even after the Avatar drops his man-form. So it is absurd for \nany lover of Avatar Meher Baba to be in search of a Perfect Master, as long as he continues \nto remain in the orbit of the Avatar's love. \n\"When you read in the Discourses by Avatar Meher Baba that it is essential for a spiritual \naspirant to have the grace of the Perfect Master to realise God, remember that beloved Baba \nhas revealed this as a general guideline for posterity when the avataric impact begins to \nfade out, and for those who will not have been fortunate enough to have come into the orbit \nof the love of the Avatar. Time and again he has revealed to us that he is the way and the \ngoal. Whosoever loves and obeys the Avatar, and whosover is blessed by his grace, what \nneed has he for any spiritual path? The spiritual path then follows such an aspirant, instead \nof the aspirant following the path! A true lover of Avatar Meher Baba has no concern with \nadvancement on the spiritual path; he is continually concerned with effacement of himself \nin the love of the Lord. A lover's goal is to become like dust at the feet of the beloved Lord! \n\"In spite of Avatar Meher Baba's 'Last Warning' of July 1968, it is surprising to get news \nfrom different countries, especially from India and the USA, that quite a number of people \nwho follow Avatar Meher Baba, and some of them who ae very close in their love for him, \nhave fallen a prey to some self-appointed saints and sadgurus who operate as immaculate \npersons, full of modesty, professing to have been installed overnight by some spiritual \nhierarchy to act as 'masters' to followers of Avatar Meher Baba. \n\"The astute modus operandi of such masters is the very cause for many innocent hearts and \nsusceptible minds to believe that their love for and obedience to such saints and masters \nwill help them to love Avatar Meher Baba all the more, and will get them closer to him, now \nthat Avatar Meher Baba is no more physically in their midst. \n\"Some of these teachers and preceptors are also vitiating the minds and hearts of the \ninnocent, saying that Meher Baba is not their master, but their master's master! It sounds so \nridiculous, and at once so apt. Such is the divine leela! \n\"These masters diligently promote the image of one another among themselves, and \nestablish a mutual admiration society or clan. They savor homage, obeisance and \nadmiration of their followers. They begin to imitate Meher Baba's ways and mode of dress, \neven imitate his silence and hand and finger movements. Such people are indeed perfect \nmimics, rather than spiritual masters and saints. Beloved Baba would draw our attention to \nsuch mimics and call them his spiritual clowns! \n\"They sham an aura of sanctity, allow people to prostrate before them, bless Baba pictures \nand lockets, bless the people, and lead their followers to believe that they are stationed on \nhigher planes of consciousness or are Realised 'Perfect Masters,'  and that obedience to \nthem is imperative. Some of these Gurus are going to the extent of telling their followers \nthat as Meher Baba's tomb is now 'inactive,' and as a number of the Mandali are dead or \ngone senile, there is no use going to Meherabad and Meherazad. Where beloved Baba's \nphotos adorned the walls, now pictures of these gurus are seen! 'Sahavas' is now also held \nby these masters, imitating beloved Meher Baba, but taking great care to see that their \natmosphere is maintained, and not superseded by Meher Baba atmosphere. \n\"Sufism Reoriented, now re-reoriented (in the West), and Vedantism reoriented (in the \nEast), are beginning to raise their heads in direct defiance to beloved Baba's timeless \nwarnings. Such spiritual jingoism leads me to recall what beloved Meher Baba had said to \none such master who came to him: \n'Of what avail if you were to gain the whole world and lose me...?' \n\"Such masters have gone to the extent of ordering their groups to shun the 'Last Warning' \ngiven by beloved Avatar Meher Baba in July 1968. The printed leaflets have been destroyed \nby the orders of some of these masters. In the 'Last Warning' beloved Baba has warned all \nwho love and follow him, and would want to do so, as follows: \n'It is equally important at this critical period of the avataric age to beware at all times of \npersons who lead others into believing that they are saintly and pious, and profess to \npossess supernatural powers. However pious such persons appear to be, a Baba-lover must \nnever mix such piety with the divinity of the Avatar. \n'A true Baba-lover must remember the repeated warning given to all Baba-lovers time and \nagain, to stay away from persons who feel and assert that they are masters and saints, and \npossess powers to help human beings...' \n\"I have been witness to these words of beloved Baba warning all who wish to be helped in \nloving him with one-pointed devotion, and wanting to get closer to him, to realise him as \ntheir own self. \n\"Again and again, for our own highest benefit, beloved Meher Baba cautioned his lovers \nagainst running after yogis, gurus and saints, or visiting their ashrams or shrines, as there is \nno longer any need for these pursuits. Avatar Meher Baba was and is the living God. It is he \nwho is the fountainhead of grace, and he is eternally the way and the goal at one and the \nsame time for his lovers. \n\"Share this letter with all, and let all lovers of Meher Baba know once for all that it is \nbeloved Meher Baba who remains responsible for their spiritual welfare as long as they \ncontinue to love and obey him, and that they should hold fast to hid daaman, as he exhorted \nus to, till the very end. There are no intermediaries required on the path to love him, for he \nsays again and again that he is the supreme Sadguru and the divine beloved. We have his \nlasting assurance on this when he says: \n'I am already yours when you become mine.' \nYours brotherly, \nEruch \n(A letter from Eruch Jessawala circulated at his request \nto the various Meher Baba centers around the world) \n\"Meherazad, 15th January 1981 \n\"Jai Meher Baba \n\"Dear brothers and sisters, \n\"Many of you in the East and West may have read the printed circular letter dated 25th \nNovember 1980 issued from Meherazad. \n\"On reading the circular letter, many lovers of Avatar Meher Baba felt that the warning \ngiven to the Baba-lovers in the East and the West was very timely and helpful. While some \nBaba-lovers requested clarification on certain points on the issue of the warning, some \nothers were surprised or most upset, and responded accordingly. \n\"To them my reply is as follows: \n\"Please do not feel surprised or upset. We the Mandali have simply done our duty to sound \nthe bell of warning for all concerned, either to pay heed to the warning, or remain \nindifferent about it, or totally ignore it. \n\"It is left to the individuals either to live their lives solely for the love of their beloved Avatar \nMeher Baba, or to love him for material and spiritual benefits. \n\"We do not wish to enter into any further correspondence on this subject. \n\"I repeat, we have no intention to dictate to anyone the way one should choose to lead one's \npersonal or spiritual life. It was our duty to just sound the bell of warning to alert Baba-\nlovers everywhere; and we have done so - pay heed or ignore it; it is one's own lookout, \nwhat truly matters is love for him. \n\"The bell of warning that you and others heard is not directed to the ones who love, and \nwould want to love, only Avatar Meher Baba, but it is directed to Baba-lovers who also do \nlove Baba wholeheartedly, but are misled into believing that one who fervently imparts \nMeher Baba's messages and discourses to them must be a saint, guru or Perfect Master, and \nis therefore to be revered as such. This attitude unfortunately creates diversion of focus and \nbifurcation of homage, which Meher Baba discouraged always by warning his lovers time \nand again. Hence the bell of warning. \n\"There are always five Perfect Masters at all times, as revealed to us by our beloved Avatar \nMeher Baba. He has also revealed to us that even after the Avatar drops his physical body, \nthe five Perfect Masters are not known publicly nor function openly, because they do not \ncome into public prominence during the period of 100 to 200 years, as the Avataric \ninfluence and impact continue to be at their height as if the Avatar were physically present. \n\"Hence, we the Mandali do not know who are the presently living five Perfect Masters - as \nthey remain completely backstage, according to what beloved Avatar Meher Baba said to us. \n\"The role of the Mandali is to strive to be, by beloved Baba's grace, the perfect slaves of their \nLord Avatar Meher Baba, without any desire for material gain or spiritual advancement. \nNone of us Mandali is either a Perfect Master or an illumined saint; and none of us long to \nbecome one. Beloved Meher Baba is the ever-living and guiding supreme Perfect Master for \nall times, for his Mandali, and also for his lovers whose lives are directly linked to him since \nmany lifetimes. \nYours lovingly, \nEruch \n\"P. S. No further correspondence on this subject will be entertained.\" \nMeher Baba explained that, at any one time on earth, there are 56 people of the fifth plane, \nand 56 people of the sixth plane in the functioning Spiritual Hierarchy. There are many \nother people on the fifth and sixth planes, or between them, who are not part of the \nhierarchy - 8,400,000 (LM8 p2884). \nThe functioning Spiritual Hierarchy consists of 7000 people on and between the higher \nplanes. In Avataric periods the Avatar is the 7001st person in the Hierarchy. For more about \nthe Hierarchy, see 'Spiritual Hierarchy' in Book Two, and GS p271-274. \nFilis Frederick quoted Baba as having said, \n\"My four  favorite  saints  are  St. Teresa, St. Catherine, St. Francis and St. Augustine.\" \nThese are Teresa of Avila, Catherine of Siena, Francis of Assisi and Augustine of Hippo. Baba \nprobably meant these were his favorites from among the well-known Christian 'saints'. \nFrancis of Assisi was, Baba explained, a Perfect Master. (Aw 20:2 p42, HM p170) \nThe great majority of those who claim to be spiritual masters are not real masters. Some are \ndeluded, really believing in their own advancement. Others know they have not experienced \nGod or Truth, but  nevertheless pretend to be advanced or Realised. \nA few genuinely advanced (but not yet Realised) souls do act as spiritual guides. The Wali of \nthe fifth plane and the Pir of the sixth plane can help seekers to advance up to their own \nlevel. For more about them see EN p29-32. There are other souls on the fifth and sixth plane \nwho have no Gross or Subtle consciousness. For more about them see EN p101-104. For \nwhat can happen to imitation saints and their followers, see Be p49-54. \nFor another version of the explanation on 'opiumised' saints, see AO p214-216. \nAVATAR MEHER BABA'S MESSAGE \n\"To love me for what I may give you is not loving me at all. To sacrifice anything in my cause \nto gain something for yourself is like a blind man sacrificing his eyes for sight. I am the \ndivine beloved, worthy of being loved because I am love.

If you have to write something, remember me before starting, and then mentally \nsay 'Baba, it is you, not I, who is writing.'\" \nMeher Baba, 30 March 1930, Nasik, LM4 p1293 \nMrs. Greenside, an author of spiritual books, was meeting Baba for the first time \nDorothy Greenside: I felt within myself an inspiration which enabled me to write. But all of a \nsudden the power seemed to diminish and was lost. I have no desire to write anymore. \nBaba: These were mere glimpses. They are always temporary and fleeting. But I will help \nyou. You are not to blame. It was not your fault that this inspiration and power have gone \naway. The reason was that it was not the time. The time was not right for you to have that \npower, for it to appear and for you to retain it. It is no fault of yours. But with my help, you \nwill have the inspiration. You will regain it, and it will then always be with you. One day you \nwill be able to help humanity much through your writings. \n10 October 1933, London, LM5 p1820 \n\"One of the requirements of acquiring control over thoughts is to become fully conscious of \nwhat they are. They have to be attended to before they are controlled. In ordinary \nintrospection it is often not possible for the beginner to devote adequate attention to all the \nshadowy thoughts which pass through his mind. It is therefore helpful for the aspirant \noccasionally to write down all his thoughts as they come, and then to inspect them carefully \nat leisure. This process is different from writing planned articles. Thoughts are here left \nwithout any direction or restraint, and are allowed to appear as they come, so that even \nrepressed elements from the subconscious mind have an access to the conscious mind. \n\"In a more advanced stage, an intensive awareness of mental processes can take place while \nthoughts appear in consciousness, and writing becomes unnecessary. The watching of \nmental operations should be accompanied by critical evaluation of thoughts. Thoughts \ncannot be controlled except through the sense of their value or lack of value. When the \ndiverse types of thoughts which assail the mind are critically evaluated, and the internal \nstirrings of sanskaras are faced, understood and taken for what they are worth, the mind is \nfreed from all obsessions and compulsions in relation to them.\" \nMeher Baba, c.1940, India, Di v3 p82 \n\"I have a strong wish now to embark on a series of writings that would bring unmistakably \nto Western minds the fact of Baba, and the true function of spirituality. Perhaps his grace \nwill enable me to eventually do this. I do not think this is too bold of me. Eknath caused even \nan idiot boy to write a great work.  Baba can do the same with me if he considers it \nnecessary as a part of his work.\" \nFrancis Brabazon, in a letter to \nEruch Jessawalla, 11 May 1954, TK p15 \n\"Baba very happily approves, with his blessings, your idea of embarking on a series of \nwritings on Baba - all the facts. Baba says, 'Do it, and begin doing it from now.'

    "text": "YOGA \nBook Two \n\"A yogi, even after he attains the highest yogic state in his study, does not reach freedom, \nbecause there are still for him the sanskaras (meaning impressions) to finish up with. \n\"Sanskaras mean the impressions left behind when doing any good or bad action. Even a \nthought creates a sanskara. Talking, hearing, thinking, seeing, eating, sleeping, etc. - in fact, \neven Subtle movements - cause sanskaras or impressions, which have to be experienced \nwithout a single hitch, with a mechanical precision, unless removed away root and branch \nby a Master's grace or blessing. \n\"Our present existence and all the related experiences of pain and pleasure, virtue and sin \nabout it, are the results of our past sanskaras, or amal, as termed by the Muslims. \n\"The very breath we breathe, the eyelid we twitch, the finger we lift, are all due to past \nimpressions. Our present existence is the mere unfoldment of our past Subtle impressions \nin Gross form. And again, it is our present Gross actions that recreate impressions, and so \non. A good word or a good action has its good result compressed in an impression - suppose \nin the form of a circle - and a bad word or action likewise stores up a bad result in a similar \nSubtle form. \n\"That is, good actions in this life necessitate acquiring a happier state in the next formation. \nAnd similarly, a bad action in the present life brings about a bad result in the same way. \nThere is that tie, which has not been dispensed away in any case. \n\"Good actions bind a man with a golden chain, and bad actions with iron and spiked chains. \nBut the chain is there in either case. The man has not been set free. Yoga or other studies are \ngood actions, and they give the person a better chance in the next incarnation. But they do \nnot set him free, or give Liberation. To have Liberation, one must neither have virtue nor \nvice on one's credit or debit side. But it should be a clean slate, to reach the state described \nin an Urdu couplet: \n'We shall not go either to heaven or hell; \nBut on the day of final judgement \nwe shall stand gazing at the face of Muhammad.' \n\"And this is impossible to reach without the grace of the Guru. For a Master, it is the work of \na moment, though. The vast and almost infinite impressions of a person may be likened to a \nheap of dry grass, which it is impossible for the person to clean out. Even the  process of \ncleaning out without a Master, that is, through yoga, etc., means contracting impressions \nagain in different forms. \n\"But this heap of dry grass is a work of a moment for a lighted match, which only the Perfect \nMaster possesses. The Perfect Master uses his matches, but mostly for the members of his \nCircle only, and thus at the right moment brings them to his own level in less than a second. \nBut even those who have no direct connection with a Perfect Master can derive the greatest \npersonal benefit merely through the contact and company of his personality: \n'One moment, half a moment, \nand even half of a half of a moment \nIn contact with a Perfect Master, \nand ten million of your sins are washed away.'\" \nMeher Baba, 4 October 1922, Manzil-e-Meem, \nBombay, RD p70-80 \nPart of another version of the same explanation: \n\"No yogi can attain eternal freedom or emancipation, even though he might have reached \nthe highest yogic state of samadhi through his practices, because sanskaras are still there, \nand all ties have not yet been snapped... \n\"Yoga and other practices are good, and merit an aspirant a good life in the next birth, but a \nman is never free from bondage or given Mukti (Liberation) as a result of them.\" \nLM2 p418-419 \nAlso see RD p103-104 \nand LM2 p438-439 and 720 \n\"There was once a yogi who had the power to remove his intestines and wash them. One \nday he did this, and kept them in the sun to dry. A dog saw the organs and ran away with \nthem. Terribly upset, the yogi ran after the dog. \n\"You may think that I am exaggerating, but it is a common feat among yogis. Such powers do \nnot count along the Path. I am not going to give you such powers - otherwise you might have \nto chase after dogs.\" \nMeher Baba, June 1928, Toka, \nto his women Mandali, LM3 p1061 \n\"The spiritual Path is not a bed of roses. After fourteen years of fasting, the great yogi Farid \nShakkar  Ganje had reached the fourth plane, but only knew how to kill sparrows. Once a \nSadguru was sitting in the shade of a tree observing him. Seeing the birds, Farid said, 'Let all \nthe sparrows drop dead.' Instantly all the sparrows were dead. Then Farid, by his command, \nmade them come alive again. The Sadguru taunted him: 'That is nothing. Learn Fakiri - \ncontrol over yourself.' \n\"Once Farid found an old woman lowering a bucket into a well, and drawing it back up again \nempty. This happened several times, and he expressed his surprise. The old woman, who \nwas a saint on the fifth plane, replied, 'It is better than your commands of die and come \nalive.' Hearing this, Farid Ganje was awakened to the reality of his powers, and began \nsearching for a Master. He found one, and by the Master's grace, became a Perfect Master \nhimself.\" \n10 December 1928, Meherabad, LM3 p1126 \nNadine Tolstoy came to meet Meher Baba on his first trip to  America. He told her, \"You \nhave been waiting for me a long time, and now I have come. I will help you... I know all. I will \nhelp you.\" \nNadine had been practising Kriya Yoga under Paramahansa Yogananda. Baba 'gave her a \nvery serious look' and told her: \n'It is not for the West - not for you.' \n19 November 1931, Harmon, New York, LM4 p1483 \nAll the meditations, yogas, concentrations do not teach what Baba teaches you through \neveryday living. That is, to be kind to those who ill-treat you, and to love those you dislike. \nThis is the highest practice of yoga. \nWhen Christ was mocked, spat upon and beaten, he did not use his powers, but he retaliated \nwith love. \nYou should be glad of an opportunity to be mistreated by others. You should thank them for \nthe opportunity of suffering and loving. The purpose of your being with Baba is to eliminate \nthe ego. \n1930s? T p94 \nLove is a mighty force. It not only enables one to put the ideal of selfless service into \npractice, but would transform one into God. With love, one can follow any of the yogas most \nsuitable to his or her temperament. It will enable an aspirant to follow the rigid principles \nunderlying the spiritual Path, and where and when necessary, make him turn his back to the \nworldly pleasures for the sake of union with the beloved. \nFebruary 1934, Madras, Me p6 \n\"One yogi in  Gwalior was very greedy. He was all the time thinking of money. But yoga \ntaught him the trick of going into samadhi. \n\"One day he sat opposite the Raja's palace, and before going into samadhi, thought, 'I must \nhave a thousand rupees from the Raja.' Then he went into samadhi. \n\"For seven days he was in this state. He took no food or drink, he just sat there. People \nthought he was a saint. \n\"The Raja came to know about him. He went near him, and just touched him on the back. \nThat touch brought the yogi down from his samadhi, and as soon as he woke up, he asked \nfor two thousand rupees.\" \n23 April 1937, Nasik, Aw 16:2 p51 \nAnother version: Di (7th ed.) p243-244 \n\"In Rama's time a yogi once did penance for one hundred years. There was another man \nwho loved the Master. He did no penance, no fasting. He only loved Rama. \n\"One day the Master went walking in the jungle. The yogi opened his eyes and said to him, \n'O Rama, when will I see your formless face?' \n\"Rama replied, 'In fifty years.' \n\"The yogi was frightfully disappointed, and said 'I made penance for one hundred years, and \nI suffered much, and still fifty years to wait!' \n\"The next day the Master accosted the happy devotee, and this loving one asked, 'O Rama, \nwhen will I see your formless state?' \n\"Rama replied, 'After fifty more lives.' \n\"The devotee said, 'So soon!' And thereupon he got into such an ecstasy that he died. And as \nhe was dying, he saw Rama's formless state.\" \nMeher Baba, before February 1939 \nTr p7, also MJ Feb. 1939 \nGod manifests his presence when and where lust, greed, anger, jealousy, hatred, back-biting \nand selfish desires are totally absent. But, as they are the outcome of impressions \n(sanskaras) of past lives, and must necessarily be expressed, getting rid of them is \nordinarily impossible. It would be like a rock trying to lift itself. \nNevertheless, past impressions must be expressed to be got rid of. But at the same time that \nthese past impressions are being expressed and spent, new ones are forged, because of the \npresence and assertion of the lower self. If one is to be free of the endless chain of \nimpressions, past and present, this assertive lower self must be abolished. \nOnly when one's assertive (lower) self is removed can the impressions be automatically \nspent without incurring the binding of fresh sanskaras. One who has achieved this can \nnever be bound by, or held responsible any more, for his actions, good or bad, which are the \nexpression of his past impressions of virtue, patience, lust, anger, etc. Thus, with the \ncessation of new sanskaras, all past impressions naturally unwind to the finish, and one is \nfree of all impressions. \nTo follow the path of the true yogas - karma yoga, dnyan yoga, raj yoga, bhakti yoga - is the \nremedy for the uprooting of this heritage of evils derived from past impressions, expressed \nby constant actions, and sustained by the continual formation of new ones. \nIn karma yoga, one tries to lose one's self in selfless service for others. In dnyan yoga one \ntries to lose one's self in contemplation and meditation. In raj yoga one tries to lose one's \nidentity with the individual self, and establish identity with the universal self by aiming, \nthrough constant mental poise and non-attachment, to be in the world and yet not of  it. In \nbhakti yoga one tries to lose one's self in devotion to God. Even in these yogas, only when \nthe zenith is reached can the individuality of the lower self be lost, yet consciousness \nremain. \nBut the easiest and safest way to lose one's self is by completely surrendering to the Perfect \nMaster. Then the past, present and future of the one who has surrendered are drowned in \nthe Master, and he is no longer either bound by, or responsible for, any of his actions, \nwhether good or bad, expressed during his implicit obedience to the Master. Thus complete \nsurrenderance to the Perfect Master is, in itself, freedom. \nMeher Baba, February or March 1954, MD p9-10 \nAlso Gl Feb. 1978 p24 \n\"... Miracle-mongering by the average yogi is not only poles apart from the spiritual path, \nbut is actually a hindrance to the individual's evolution towards spiritual progress. The \nfollowing incident in the life of a Hindu Master shows the disregard in which it is held by \nPerfect Masters, who are Truth personified. \n\"The Master was one day by the river's edge, waiting for one of the little ferry boats that \ntake passengers across the stream for the diminutive fare of one anna. A yogi, seeing him \nthus waiting, came up to him, literally walked across the river and back, and said, 'That was \nmuch easier, was it not?' \n\"The Master smilingly replied, 'Yes, and had less value than that of the boat fare - one anna.'\" \nc.1954? GS p72-73 \n\"... Meher Baba directs me to send you his blessings and love, and to inform you that he is \nhappy you have been remembering him in the course of your studies. Meher Baba wants \nyou to study the book God Speaks, for it will help you to understand the mystery of life \nephemeral and the truth of existence eternal. The book God Speaks is a very important \ntextbook for all students who are keen to understand the fundamental purpose and \nmechanics of life and the universe. God Speaks reveals to us that all experiences, even of \nspiritual aspirants on the path to God-realisation 'gotten in the natural course of involution \nof consciousness' are of the domain of illusion. \n\"Therefore, how much more distracting are the experiences of a layman in a laboratory who \nexperiments with drugs to induce experiences with the semblance of those of an aspirant on \nthe spiritual path? Meher Baba has said that the one and true experience is the experience \nof Truth, the reality, for once the realisation of God is attained, it remains a continual and \nnever-ending experience. The all-pervading effulgence of God the reality is experienced by \nan aspirant who keeps himself scrupulously above all illusory experimentations, and \nhumbly takes refuge in the love of God... \n\"It is absolutely essential for a spiritual aspirant who genuinely longs for union with God, \nthe reality, to shun false practices of yogic postures and exercises, meditation on other than \nGod the beloved, experiments with certain drugs, and fads for types of food. These things do \nnot uplift the aspirant, nor do they draw him out of the rut of illusion. Experiences born of \nthese practices wear off no sooner than the aspirant withdraws from, or is thrown out of, \nthe orbit of the effects produced by the technique employed. \n\"All so-called spiritual experiences generated by taking mind-changing drugs (such as LSD, \nmescaline and psilocybin mentioned in your letter) are superficial, and they add \nenormously to one's addiction to the deceptions of illusion, which is but the shadow of \nreality. The experience of a semblance of freedom that these drugs may temporarily give to \none is in actuality a millstone round the aspirant's neck in his efforts towards emancipation \nfrom the rounds of birth and death. \n\"It is good to know that there are drugs that alleviate human sufferings, it is better to have a \nknowledge of a specific drug for a particular ailment, and it is best to put to use the specific \ndrug for the benefit of a human body. But there is no drug that can promote the aspirant's \nprogress, nor ever alleviate the suffering of separation from his beloved God. Love is the \nonly propeller and the only remedy. The aspirant should love God with all his heart, until he \nforgets himself and recognises his beloved God in himself and others...\" \nAdi K. Irani, in a letter to Alan Cohen, 10 October 1964 \nLF p98-100, also The Glass Pearl \n\"Now I shall write to you what once I directly heard from Baba about the nature of \nexperience one gets after taking drugs. To understand what Baba exactly said, I should first \nexplain different aspects of consciousness. \n\"Normally a man experiences three aspects of consciousness: sound sleep, in which there is \nneither consciousness nor unconsciousness; dream state, which has dream-consciousness; \nand waking state, which has full Gross consciousness. \n\"An experience is valid when the one who experiences and the objects of experience both \nbelong to the same plane of consciousness, as in the waking-state, in which both the subject \nand object belong to the Gross plane, and so the experience is valid. \n\"In a spiritually advanced state (not of a yogi) of a mast, the subject and object belong to one \nplane of consciousness, whether it is first, second or third and so on planes, and the \nexperience is valid. \n\"In a dream one goes into a Subtle plane, but the objects that he experiences belong to the \nGross plane, and so the experience is not valid, because the planes of the subject and object \nare not the same. \n\"Reverse is the case in a yoga-consciousness. A yogi experiences Subtle plane objects, but \nfrom the Gross plane, and so the experience is not valid. \n\"Now, what Baba said about drug experience is this: After taking a drug, one experiences \nshadow of the Subtle plane objects from the Gross plane, and so the experience is not only \nnot valid, but full of grotesque sights and feelings much more unreal and confounding than \nfantasies, and so harmful spiritually, mentally and physically.\" \nAdi K.

Out of the Nothing, seven states of gas\ncame into being. The seventh evolved state is hydrogen. Out of this seventh gaseous\nstate evolution and production came into being.\nC reation can be reconciled with evolution because all is in seven stages: seven\nstages of production, seven stages of evolution, and seven stages of involution.\nSo, it is said that God created the universe in seven days. From the Nothing, most\nﬁnite shadow and inﬁnite shadow emerged simultaneously.\nthe all-p e rvading inﬁnite trio- n a t u re of God—gradually expands\nad infinitum and manifests apparently as infinite Nothingness or\nas inﬁnite Creation.\nThe Whim or Lahar\nThe cause which led the most ﬁnite Nothing, latent in the in-\nﬁnite Everything, to manifest itself as inﬁnite Nothingness, is the\noriginal cause called the “CAUSE.”\nThis Cause is just nothing but the WHIM or lahar of God. This\noriginal whim can also be called the ﬁrst “WORD” u t t e red by God—\n“WHO AM I?”\nThe inﬁnitude of the God-Is state made God absolutely inde-\npendent, and by virtue of being absolutely independent it is but\nnatural for God to exercise His infinite whim to experience and\nenjoy His own infinity. To exercise a whim is always the mark of\nan independent nature, because it is whimsicality that always\ncolours the independent nature.\nIt is the original infinite whim which is responsible for giv-\ning Cause to the latent-all that was of the Nothing to manifest as\nN o t h i n g n e s s .\nBut before God exercised His original infinite whim to make\nmanifest the latent-all that was of the Nothing, this whim of God\nwas itself latent as the Nothing in the Everything of the inﬁnitude\nof absolutely independent God in the God-Is state.\nHow is it then possible for the latent original inﬁnite whim to\ns u rge in God and make manifest itself and all that is latent of the\nNothing as Nothingness?\nWhim after all is a whim; and, by its very nature, it is such that\n“why—wherefore—when” can ﬁnd no place in its nature. A whim\nmay come at any moment; it may come now or after a few months\nor after years, and it may not come at all.\nS i m i l a r l y, the original infinite whim, after all, is a whim, and\ntoo, it is the whim of God in the state of infinitude! This whim\nmay not surge in God at all; and, if it surges, either at any moment\nor after thousands of years or after a million cycles, it need not be\ns u r p r i s i n g .\n78 God Speaks\n\nThus it is, that the original infinite whim of God in the state\nof inﬁnitude once surged; and it surged both spontaneously and all\nof a sudden in absolutely independent God Who is eternally Eter-\nnal. Hence this whim, which once surged, once began the Begin-\nning of all things in Creation.\nIn short, this original inﬁnite latent whim of God in the state of\ni n ﬁnitude, once it surged in God Who is absolutely independent,\nmade itself manifest, and simultaneously with its manifestation,\nit manifested the latent-all that was of the Nothing as Nothingness.\nThus the whim created the Nothing.\nLet us recapitulate how inﬁnite Nothing came out of most ﬁn i t e\nE v e ry t h i n g :\nGod Beyond is inﬁnite Everything. Inﬁnite Everything may be\nc o m p a red to an inﬁnite, limitless ocean. Ther e f o re this limitless\nocean is inﬁnite Everything. Thus every drop in the ocean is most ﬁ-\nnite Everything. In short, if inﬁnite ocean is inﬁnite Everything then\ne v e ry drop of the ocean is most ﬁnite Every t h i n g .\nB e f o re the whim surges in the limitless ocean and before Cre-\nation is manifested, the creation point (Om point) through which the\nC reation is ejected is itself in the limitless ocean as inﬁnite Every-\nthing because, prior to the surging of the whim, perfect tranquility\nprevailed and pervaded the limitless ocean; there was no question\nof “drops” of the ocean and there was no separateness. There was\nlimitless ocean as inﬁnite Everything.\nAt the instant when the whim surged in the inﬁnite Every t h i n g\nthe creation point or Om point manifested as most ﬁnite Every t h i n g .\nI n ﬁnite Nothing was latent in the inﬁnite Everything, but when\nthe whim surged the inﬁnite Nothing got manifested through most\nﬁnite Everything, which is the Om point.\nThus, through the most ﬁnite E v e rything, the inﬁnite Nothing\nis ejected gradually , manifesting itself as expanding ad inﬁnitum.\nSimultaneously with the projection of the latent Nothing and\nwith the manifestation of Nothingness, the consciousness which\nexisted as Nothing, latent in the infinitude of the God-Is state,\nalso got projected and manifested itself gradually as the conscious-\nness of God, and made God experience Himself as God the Cre a t o r"

It remains eter n a l l y, re g a rdless of whether that\nconsciousness fully gained is the consciousness of the false Noth-\ningness experienced as real, or whether that consciousness is the\nconsciousness of Reality Itself.\nEventually consciousness does make God realize His own re-\nality after that same consciousness has attained complete maturity .\nConsciousness is fully matured to realize Reality only after it is nur-\nt u red by the apparent awareness of the false. This awareness of the\nfalse as real becomes so intensiﬁed during the course of the evo-\nlution of consciousness, that the consciousness, steeped in false\na w a reness, makes God aware only of the false, which is experi-\nenced by God as the real. That is, God as Creator falsely experiences\nthe manifestation of the Nothing as real and Everything.\nIn order that the latent consciousness of God in the God-Is\nstate should make it possible for God to realize His own eternal re-\na l i t y, the projection of that latent consciousness in Ever y t h i n g\n(which, when projected outwards, becomes focussed on the false\ninfinity of Nothingness) should be withdrawn inwar d l y. By such\nan i n w a rd withdrawal, the focus of the same consciousness becomes\n80 God Speaks\ncentred on the inﬁnity of Everything (from which it had projected\no u t w a rds and given rise to the experience of inﬁnite Nothingness\nrather than the experience of the inﬁnity of Everything).\nAs said before, when the projected consciousness withdraws\ninwards or undergoes full and complete involution, that Nothing-\nness which was once experienced as reality automatically vanishes\nfor the consciousness which is now focussed completely on the\neternal Reality of the inﬁnitude of God.\nIn short, there is no n e wconsciousness to be attained to re a l-\nize Reality—the Eternal. It is the same consciousness latent in the\nE v e rything which, when it emerges out of the Nothing, ﬁrst gradu-\nally evolves and, associating with the Nothingness, then experiences\nthe Nothingness as real. When the evolution of this consciousness\nis complete and full, the same consciousness makes God experi-\nence the false Nothingness which expands ad inﬁnitum as real and\ninfinite. Again, when the same full and complete consciousness\nreaches full and complete maturity through its own involution, it\nrealizes infinite Reality as the only reality and gives God the ex-\nperience of His own real and eternal inﬁnite state.\nGod in His original state of infinitude is eternally infinite\nt h rough His inﬁnite, unbounded and unlimited trio- n a t u re of in-\nﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss. As God etern a l l y\nIs, the only virtual diff e rence between the original state of God a n d\nthe new states of God that He acquires is that of the conscious-\nness gained pro g ressively through the i m p ressions of the pro j e c t e d\nNothingness.\nGod in His original state of God-Is is not conscious of His in-\nﬁnite eternal existence nor of His own inﬁnite nature though He\nexists inﬁnitely and eter n a l l y. Due to His own inﬁnite whim God\na c q u i res the consciousness of His reality and realizes His inﬁn i t e ,\ne t e rnal unlimited Self to experience His unbounded, unlimited and\ninﬁnite trio-nature.\nThus God, now with His newly acquired state of eternal con-\nsciousness, is consciously and eternally aware of His original Be-\nyond the Beyond state of God-Is, which is for ever and ever\nunconscious of the inﬁnitude of His own God-Is state. Ther e f o re\nthe goal is to realize the eternal and inﬁnite God-state c o n s c i o u s l y."

In this state man experi-\nences that his nature is not the finite body (typifying happiness)\nbut is inﬁnite bliss; not the ﬁnite energy but inﬁnite power; not the\nfinite mind but infinite knowledge.

This means that the basic ﬁnite triple nature of man,\nwhich was upheld by the basic inﬁnite trio- n a t u re of God, is un-\nlinked from the basic inﬁnite trio-nature of God.\nAlthough the man loses his basic finite triple nature, the full\nconsciousness that he gained in his travail is not lost, because full\nconsciousness once gained is never lost, except in gross misuse of\nthe powers of the fourth plane, as previously described.\nIn this state, with consciousness intact and complete, the lim-\nited and ﬁnite body (typifying happiness), the limited and ﬁnite en-\ne rg y, and the limited and ﬁnite mind are all totally unlinked fro m\nthe unlimited and inﬁnite bliss, power and knowledge re s p e c t i v e l y.\nThis is the stage when man is fully conscious and yet no longer\nexperiences the false finite Nothingness as real and infinite.

These are now\nunlinked and have simply vanished from the focus of the con-\nsciousness. They must vanish because they were of the ﬁnite Noth-\ning by nature, which literally means absolutely nothing.\nBut before body , energy and mind ultimately lose their grip\nover the consciousness of man, there is one predominant experi-\nence which he has in his everyday life, that of sleeping and waking\neach day .\nThis fundamental experience in a normal man gives rise to\nthree basic states in his everyday life:\nThe ﬁrst state is the sound sleep state or the state of complete\nunconsciousness of the Self in man.\nThe second state is the dream state or the semi-conscious or semi-\nawake state.\n86 God Speaks\nThe third state is the completely awake state or the state of com-\nplete consciousness of the Self in man as man.\nN o w, man’s cognizance is life in man, and man’s life is m a d e\ncognizant through the a c t i o n sof man.

Impre s-\nsions and actions are thus interdependent because impressions are\nfed by actions and actions are motivated by impressions.\nAs said pre v i o u s l y, the source of impressions is traced as far\nback as the latent Nothing in the Everything, which means God\nin the God-Is state. When the Nothing ﬁrst became manifested as\nNothingness in the shape of Creation, the primal manifestation\nof the Nothing gave rise to the ﬁrst trace of consciousness in God\nand hereupon the first impression of Nothingness manifested.\nThis first impression pr o c reated impressions with the evolution\nof consciousness.\nA c c o rd i n g l y, all impressions are of the Nothing, and as Nothing\nliterally means nothing, these impressions are naturally nothing\nbut mere impressions. But, because it was through these very im-\np ressions of Nothing that consciousness evolved fully and com-\npletely in man, the consciousness of man is closely linked with\nthese impressions of Nothing and makes man consciously expe-\nrience this false Nothing as Everything and real.\nI m p ressions as such play a vital role in the life of man until\nsuch time as they are completely wiped away , relieving and fr e e-\ning consciousness from experiencing the false Nothing as Every-\nthing and real. Consciousness, when relieved of all impr e s s i o n s ,\nwill no longer experience the false Nothing as real but it will ex-\nperience Reality as the unlimited Self (i.e., God).\nAs long as impressions persist and continue to impress the con-\nsciousness of man, these impressions, activated and generated by\nthe energy of man, are being constantly imprinted on the mind of\nman and are being retained or stored in his sub-consciousness.\nSome of these impressions remain dormant in the sub-\nconsciousness of man for hours, or days, or years, and sometimes\nfor lifetimes. But most of them get projected through the sub-\nconsciousness of man every moment of his life while he experie n c e s"

Man thus ﬁnds that he sometimes\nhas prescience of things that come to pass after a lapse of time.\nTo sum up: In the very act of creation, the acts of preservation\nand destruction are also present; so, by creating illusion God, as\nit were, simultaneously preserves and destroys it.\n92 God Speaks\nIn re a l i t y, there f o re, nothing is created that remains to be pre-\ns e rved and destroyed, because the created Creation is of the\nNothing, and this Nothing in reality means absolutely nothing in\nall re s p e c t s .\nThough this Nothing is indeed nothing at all, yet when it is said\nthat the Nothing is created by Brahma, p re s e rved by Vishnu and de-\nstroyed by Mahesh or Shiva, it is spoken of only in terms of the in-\nfinite illusion, i.e., in terms of the infinite, divine dream state of\nGod related to the illusory universe—the brahmand.*\nIn the eternity of reality there is absolutely no such thing as cre-\nation, pre s e rvation or destruction, neither is there space, nor is\nt h e re any scope for re l a t i v i t y, much less could there ever be the cor-\nrelated factors of time, such as the past, present and future.\nIn the eternity of Reality , the one, inﬁnite, eternal, all-perv a d i n g\nexistence i s .\nIn short, when the consciousness of a man makes him expe-\nrience the impressions of the Nothing sub- c o n s c i o u s l y, the man\nis said to be dreaming a dream.

When God in the man state completely wakes up\ne v e ry day from His sound sleep state, the full consciousness which\nlay dormant during sound sleep and the multitude of impressions\nwhich had vanished (i.e., out of sight and out of experience) in the\nsound sleep are now all catapulted out to produce once again the\nfalse experiences of the ﬁnite Nothing manifesting as real and in-\nﬁnite Nothingness.\nThis unending chain of alternating absorption and ejection of\nconsciousness and impressions in the alternating sound sleep and\nawake states continues until ultimately all of the impressions are\nousted or wiped off clean through the experiencing of the opposite\ni m p ressions in the processes of r e i n c a rnation and involution of\nconsciousness. Thus impressionless consciousness alone re m a i n s\nto give God the conscious experience of His original, eternal, in-\nﬁnite, real God-state.\nAs God invariably gains full and unimpressioned consciousness\nthrough the human-form, the different states of man may be taken\nas examples with which to compare the different states of God.\nThe sound sleep state of God in the man state not only resem-\nbles the divine sound sleep state of God but is literally the same\noriginal divine sound sleep state of God in the Beyond the Beyond\nstate of God-Is where unbounded, absolute vacuum prevails.*\n94 God Speaks\n* There is a profound and very real relationship between God-realization and sound\nsleep. The eternal desire of the soul is to become one with God, but because con-\nsciousness attaches itself to the gross, the soul seems to become one merely with\nthe gross. In the stone state, for instance, gross consciousness makes the soul iden-\ntify itself with the stone although, in reality, the soul is all the time one with God.\nTo make this clearer, let us suppose that you take opium or an intoxicating drink.\nYou feel elated or depressed, although there is no radical change in your body, and\nit is only the consciousness that is affected and gives rise to your feelings. Thus you,\nas an individual soul, are twenty-four hours within and one-with God, although\nyou feel merely gross-conscious.\nAgain, let us suppose that you feel tired and fed up and that you go to sleep. What\nis it that you are trying to do? It is nothing but to try to take refuge in God—your\nnatural and inherent state. The whole Creation ther e f o re has this conscious or\nunconscious tendency to take shelter in God the Over-Soul by entering the state of\nsound sleep for a time.\n\nWhen man passes away in the sound sleep state, absolute vac-\nuum and no consciousness prevails, and though the “self” in man\ncontinues to breathe normally, yet in that “self” of man there is no\nconsciousness of its limited “I” or ego, nor is there consciousness\nof the limited mind, energ y, body or the world. The self in man is\nnot even conscious of its own being. In short, in the sound sleep\nstate of man the “self-is” and consciousness “is-not.”\nWhen a man wakes up daily from his sound sleep state he nor-\nmally just wakes up for no reason whatsoever except that his own\nd o rmant consciousness of impressions urges or excites his sub-\nconsciousness to eject out the consciousness, and experience the\nd o rmant impressions which apparently vanish in sound sleep.\nT h e re f o re, as soon as the man wakes up, he invariably and simul-\ntaneously gains consciousness at ﬁrst of his surroundings and gradu-\nally then of his own “self” with all of its paraphernalia of the limited\n“I,” the mind, energy , the body and the world.\nS i m i l a r l y, no rhyme, no reason and no cause other than the origi-\nnal, inﬁnite whim of the absolutely independent God was the ac-\ntual Cause—the original cause—for God in the original divine sound\nsleep state to wake up out of the unbounded, original vacuum.\nJust as a man, who wakes up from his sound sleep state,* has in-\nvariably to pass through the state of dreaming ﬁrst and then wake\nup completely , gaining full consciousness after the semi-c o n s c i o u s\nstate of the dream (which may last for a very long duration or may\nlast only for a split second), so, too, is it the case with God in the\nGod-Is state. Before completely waking up from His original divine\nsound sleep state, God necessarily experiences the divine semi-\nconscious state which is the divine dream state or the creator state.\nThe original, inﬁnite whim, as the Cause, manifested the ﬁ r s t\ntrickle of most-ﬁnite consciousness in God. This most-ﬁnite con-\nsciousness made God, now in a semi-conscious state, experience\nt h rough sub-consciousness the most-ﬁnite impression of the latent\nNothing which was also manifested as the Nothingness. This ex-\nperience of the most-ﬁnite ﬁrst impression of Nothingness began\nthe “divine dream”—the creation of the universe."

God in this way receives apparently real, but\nreally false, answers to His First Wo rd “Who am I?”—such as “I am\nstone,” “I am metal,” and so forth, and ﬁnally obtains the answers\n“I am man,” “I am woman.”\nWhen God identifies Himself with human beings, He is no\nlonger semi-conscious; because at this stage in the divine dr e a m\nstate, as soon as God identifies Himself with a human form He\ngains full consciousness.\nFull consciousness now having been gained, this consciousness\nought to dispel all dreams and cause God to experience the r e a l\nawake state, giving Him the realization that He is God.

This leads God to identify Himself with\nHis projected creation rather than to become conscious of Him-\nself as the real Everything and of His own identity as God.\nIn short, this is the stage at which God, while identifying Him-\nself with human beings in full consciousness, still remains quite\noblivious of His own real and original state of God-Is.\nEven in this state of full consciousness God still continues to\ne xperience the world of His own creation, and with greatest aware-\nness simultaneously continues to identify Himself with human"

For the man to commence \nexperiencing dreams means that in his initial stage of the semi-\nconscious state he begins to experience through his sub-\nconsciousness the dormant impressions of the Nothingness in\ns u b-subtle forms. The man now is not only in the initial stage of\nthe semi-conscious state and is not only beginning to experience\ndreams, but he is also starting to get involved in the dreams by be-\nginning to associate with the cr e a t u res in sub-subtle forms of his\nown creation. Thus the projection of impressions, which lay dor-\nmant in the sub-consciousness of man, makes man play the role of\nthe hero or the creator in the drama of his dreams. Because this\nman in this dream state has only just stirred from his sound sleep\nand has just attained the semi-conscious state, picture this man\ne xperiencing the dreams as one who is starting now to open his\neyes very , very slightly . The beginning of the opening of the eyes\nresembles the advent of the first trace of consciousness as sub-\nconsciousness manifested in man.\nWhile visualizing this state of man, as a parallel, picture likewise\nthat state of God in which He has just stirred from His original di-\nvine sound sleep state. God now only begins to experience the divine\nd ream state, or the Creator state, as soon as the first most- f i n i t e\ni mp ression of the Nothingness is projected through the divine sub-\nconsciousness of God. Both of these—i.e., the Nothingness and the\ndivine sub-consciousness of God—were latent as of Nothing in the\noriginal state of God as the Everything. God, now in the initial stage\nof the divine semi-conscious state, just begins to identify Himself\nwith the cre a t u res of His own Creation (i.e., His own divine dre a m )\nt h rough the inﬁnite divine sub-consciousness which just begins to\np roject the Creation, that is, the impressions of the Nothingness.\nThird Stage\nVisualize the third state of the man as still asleep, but with\nh a l f-open eyes, because a man in this state now completely expe-\nriences the semi-conscious state. In order to picture this complete\ns e m i-conscious state of the still-sleeping man, continue to visualize\nhim with eyes very , very slightly open, re p resenting the beginning\n100 God Speaks\nof the semi-conscious state. In this state, as said above, he starts to\nexperience dreams due to the false, illusory impressions of the\nNothingness which were collected sub-consciously and are now\nejected out through the projection of the sub-consciousness, giving\nrise to the beginning of the dream state of man. But, as the dre a m s\ncontinue, and as they gather momentum due to the intensity of the\np rojection of multifarious and varied dormant impressions thro u g h\nthe sub-consciousness of the man, he gets more and m o re involved\ns u b-c o n s c i o u s l y. As a result he now ﬁrmly associates himself with\nthe cre a t u res of his own creation in the dreams and he is completely\nin the semi-conscious state. This semi-conscious state of the man re p-\nresents that state which is neither the complete sound sleep state\nwithout consciousness nor the complete awake state with full con-\nsciousness. This state, so to speak, is the semi-awake state. Now visu-\nalize this third state of the man as the state of semi-consciousness\nre p resented by half-opened eyes experiencing the dreams more\nforcefully and much more intently.\nWhile visualizing this state of the man, picture as a parallel that\nstate of God in the divine dream state where God is experiencing\na semi-conscious state. At this stage, God as the creator of Cre a t i o n\nexperiences the creator state through the infinite, divine semi-\nconscious state. Here the inﬁnite divine sub-consciousness, inten-\nsively projecting Creation into being, continually af f i rms God’s\nidentification with the cr e a t u res of His own creation. This gives\nrise to inﬁnite experiences of a more forceful nature in the divine\nd ream of God, when God actually finds Himself as the cr e a t u re s\nof His Creation.\nFourth Stage\nVisualize the fourth state of the man as that in which he is still\nasleep but trying gradually to open wider his already half-opened\neyes in accordance with the greater and greater intensity of the pro-\njection of more and more impressions through the sub-consciousness\nof the man still in his dream state. Here the man is not only in a\nsemi-conscious state but is verging on being fully conscious, and is\nabout to realize his awake state."

Here the projection of inﬁnite impr e s s i o n s ,\nt h rough the inﬁnite divine sub-consciousness of God, is so inten-\ns i ﬁed in the course of the cosmic evolution of the consciousness\nof God, that this projection is about to be so completely ﬁxed, or so\np e rfectly focussed, onto the inﬁnity of Nothingness as to identify\nGod with His own most perfect image in His divine dream of Cre-\nation. Thus at this stage in the divine dream state, God the Cre a t o r\nis about to identify Himself with a human form after innumerable\ni d e n t i ﬁcations with all and everything that is in His Creation in-\ncluding inanimate and animate objects.

This is the stage in dreams when the sub-\nsubtle forms of Nothingness have reached their zenith and appear\nm o re clearly . The dreams at their height now must stop, because\nthe zenith reached by the projections of impressions through the\ns u b-consciousness of the man is at this point sufﬁcient to excite and\nu rge the emergence or manifestation of full consciousness at any\nmoment. This state of the man almost fully conscious may there f o re\nbe pictured as a man with his eyes almost wide open, though still\nasleep.

With divine, inﬁ-\nnite sub-consciousness, God is in His divine, inﬁnite semi-conscious\nstate, which when almost matured i d e n t i ﬁed God with inﬁnite im-\np ressions of animal forms. But now in the ﬁfth stage of the divine\nd ream state where God is in the completely matured divine, inﬁn i t e\ns e m i-conscious state, God can no longer be made to identify with\ni m p ressions of animal forms even though they are intensively and\ni nﬁnitely projected through His divine, inﬁnite sub-consciousness.\nAt this point a stage is reached in the divine dream state where i n ,\nwith the projection to inﬁnity of impressions projected inﬁ n i t e l y\nt h rough the divine, inﬁnite sub-consciousness of God at its zenith,\nthis inﬁnite projection has almost identiﬁed God with a human form\nand God is almost fully conscious.\nSixth Stage\nVisualize the sixth state of the man as having completely awak-\nened from his sleep and as having his eyes completely wide open.\nIn this state the man is no longer in the semi-conscious state,\nd reaming the dreams which were nothing but the hazy and faint\np rojection of the dormant impressions of Nothingness which were\ns t o red in the sub-consciousness of the man, and realized thro u g h\nhis sub-consciousness in sub-subtle forms of Nothingness.

The man now in the\nawake state no longer experiences or sees the Nothingness as some-\nthing hazy or faint as he used to see it in his dream state. With his\neyes just opened wide and fully, he is dazed and stares vacantly\nat things that now confront his sight more r e a l i s t i c a l l y. The man\nnow observes things that confront his sight as if he were seeing the\nripe, the clear and the fully developed forms of the same Nothing-\nness that he saw in his dream as raw , hazy and faint. In this state\nthe man sees, as it were, yet another dream, but he sees it much\nm o re realistically than the dream from which he awakened a split\nsecond before.\nThis is the sixth stage in the state of man where the man, dazed,\nsimply experiences the sight of things much more realistically but\nstill as if it were just a vacant dream. That is, the man sees more\nf o rcefully and realistically but still vacantly the dream of his dre a m\nstate, giving him the sense of yet another dream within the dream\nof his dream state.\nThis state corresponds to the few seconds immediately after a\nman has awakened and cannot help but see at ﬁrst theobjects that\ncome within range of his vision rather than his own self. This is be-\ncause, as soon as his eyes open after the sleep state, the sponta-\nneous opening of the long-shut eyes creates in him a sort of dazed\nstate and, although the man has awakened and is fully conscious,\nhe is still unaware of his Self or of its position in relation to the ob-\njects surrounding his very self. He simply stares at the objects upon\nwhich his gaze falls.\nWhile visualizing the sixth state of the man, make a parallel\nof it by picturing in the same way that state of God as of that instant\nwhen God has just identiﬁed Himself with a human form and has\nj u s tgained full consciousness. At that moment God is no longer in\nthe divine, inﬁnite semi-conscious state, dreaming the original di-\nvine dream which was the projection of the latent Nothing re l e a s e d\nby the divine, infinite sub-consciousness as the Creation, or as\ncompletely evolved Nothingness.\nIn this sixth state, God is now out of His original, divine sound\nsleep and His divine, inﬁnite semi-conscious states because He is\n104 God Speaks\nnow fully conscious. Here God is conscious not of His unlimited\nSelf nor of His inﬁnite, unbounded and unlimited trio-n a t u re of in-\nﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss, but is just fully conscious. God\nis fully conscious now in the sense that God is consciously ab-\nsorbed in the Nothingness which now manifests through His full\nconsciousness as clear and well defined, realistic gross states ap-\nparently demonstrating their inﬁnite aspects ad inﬁnitum.\nSeventh Stage\nVisualize the seventh state of the man where he has his eyes\nwide open and is completely and fully awake in the sense that he\nnow asserts his limited self or ego, and is conscious of his human\nf o rm or the gross body , of his surroundings and of the gross world.\nThough this man is fully conscious and completely aware of the\ng ross, and experiences the gross world in full, yet he is still un-\nconscious of the limited energy and mind of which he indir e c t l y\nmakes unconscious use, being aware of their aspects through the\nlimitations of his gross body alone. In this state the man is fully\nconscious, but gr o s s-c o n s c i o u s l y, and is fully aware of his self as\na man in the world of his surroundings.\nThe man is not only completely aware of the gross world, and\nof all things in the world which confront his view , but he also ac-\ntually experiences them by involving his fully conscious and fully\na w a re state of limited self in them. He now recognizes the objects\nof the gross world through his ﬁve predominant gross senses and\nd i ff e rentiates them one from another, using them discriminately or\nindiscriminately, automatically and indirectly utilizing energy and\nmind which are now fully developed, in attaching to them their\nrelative values as and when his limited self asserts in his awake\nstate before he passes away once again in sound sleep.*"

God now\nno longer dreams divinely the original divine dream but, with full\nconsciousness now completely gained, He experiences falsely the\ncomplete awareness. This awareness makes God falsely aware of\nthat original Nothing which was latent in His own state of inﬁ n i-\ntude, and which, with the present gain of full consciousness, makes\nGod experience that Nothing realistically as the Everything, inﬁ-\nnite and real. In other words, God, when He was in the divine, in-\nfinite semi-conscious state, was experiencing the latent Nothing\nmanifested as the Nothingness as His divine dream. Now , when\nGod is in a fully conscious state, He apparently experiences that\nNothing, not as the divine dream of Nothingness, but He now ac-\ntually experiences the awareness of this Nothing as the Every t h i n g .\nIn this stage with the advent of awareness, although God in the\nstate of creator has stopped dreaming divinely the original divine\nd ream, yet, because of His having gained full consciousness and\ncomplete awareness, God now becomes completely aware of the\noriginal divine dream not as a dream but as something realistic, not\nas illusion but as reality, not as the Nothing but as the Everything,\np re s e rving the Nothing that He created. Thus it is that, although\nGod gained full consciousness and experienced complete aware-\nness in the state of creator, this very awareness of God the Creator\np roves a deception and makes God now experience His own divine\nd ream (or the Creation) of the Nothing as Reality while He iden-\ntiﬁes Himself with the human being.\nIn short, God the Creator as the God-i n-man, though now fully\nconscious and completely aware and out of His original divine\nd ream state, yet ﬁnds Himself not as God but as man with complete\ng ross consciousness, experiencing the creation of His own original\ndivine dream state as Reality . Here it is to be said that the God-in-\nman continues to experience in the awake state with the aware n e s s\nof false reality the vacant divine dream as yet another dream ofG o d\nwithin that original divine dream.\nThis is the most alluring stage in the state of God when, with\nfull consciousness gained, God is led astray , by the false awareness  \n106 God Speaks\nattained, to identify Himself not with His unlimited and inﬁnite Self,\nbut with His most perfect image in the shape of the human being,\nwhile God continues to experience the vacant divine dre a m .\nAlthough it appears as the most fantastic imagination, yet it is\na fact that the very life of man is the veil that shrouds the r e a l i t y\nof the eternal existence of God.\nIt is the irony of divine fate that God gets lost in man to find\nHimself, and the instant that man gets lost in God, God realizes His\nReality as Existence, eternal and inﬁnite.\nIn other words, inﬁnite God becomes inﬁnitely absorbed in His\nown inﬁnitely perfect image intently seeking His inﬁnity; and al-\nthough God does gain full consciousness through it, He does not re-\nalize the reality of His own eternal, inﬁnite existence in it. But, the\ninstant the full consciousness thus gained ceases to identify God\nwith the inﬁnite re ﬂection of His inﬁnitely perfect image, this image\nvanishes from the consciousness of God, and God spontaneously\nand automatically and consciously realizes His own identity as God,\nthe inﬁnite Existence, and ﬁnds that He alone ever was, always is\nand eternally will remain the Only Reality .\nThus God in the man state, at ﬁrst realizing Himself as man, as-\ns e rted His limited aspects through the limited self or the limited\nego, the limited mind, the limited energy and the ﬁnite gross body .\nThen eventually and ultimately realizing Himself as God, He mani-\nfests His unlimited, unbounded, infinite trio- n a t u re of infinite\nknowledge, inﬁnite power and inﬁnite bliss through His divine un-\nlimited Self.\nWhile depicting, through the seven diff e rent primary stages, the\np rocess of unfoldment of the latent consciousness of God in His\noriginal, unconscious, divine sound sleep state, as compared with\nthe seven diff e rent primary states of man gaining consciousness\nright from his unconscious sound sleep state to the state where i n\nhe gains full consciousness and wakes up completely with wide-\nopen eyes, it is found that this is the process of the evolution of\nconsciousness of God which eventually identifies the fully con-\nscious God with the fully conscious man, after identifying God\nwith all and everything inanimate and animate in the drama of the\ndivine dream of Creation.18"

He feels for, longs for and pangs for union with God\nWhom He at this stage feels seeing face to face.\nThis identiﬁcation with the second section of Mind (feelings)\nis the state of God in the man state where the predominant aspect\nof divine love, which eventually leads to union with God (i.e., re a l i-\nzation of the God state consciously), is manifested most forc e f u l l y.\nHence it should be clear that the ﬁfth plane of the mental sphere\nis the state of full consciousness of thoughts only . The mastery over\nc o n t rol and creation of thoughts alone is established, and t h e re is\nno mastery or control over feelings of desires and emotions. But the\nsixth plane of the mental sphere is the state of full consciousness\nof feelings, and thus the mastery over control and creation of feel-\nings is established and no more scope is now left for even a single\nthought to penetrate into the domain of feelings.\nThe sixth plane consciousness is thought-less and governs the\nfeelings of all of the gro s s- and subtle-conscious states of God. This\nis often misinterpreted as mastery over the h e a rts of all those in the\ng ro s s- and subtle-conscious states of God. He does not govern or\nregulate the so-called hearts but controls and governs that second\nsection of Mind in the mental sphere which emanates feelings of\nemotions and desires.\nThe loving of God and the longing for His union is really and\nfully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness. Only when\nthe sixth plane of the mental sphere is transcended, does Illusion\nvanish with the vanishing of the last trace of impressions, and Re-\nality is realized.\nM e n t a l-conscious God in the man state on the sixth plane is\nstill experiencing duality , because God in this state of conscious-\nness ﬁnds Himself as Mind and not as God.\nThis experience of duality lingers on and on until the ﬁnal in-\nvolution of consciousness attains the seventh plane of conscious-\nness. This is the ﬁnal and seventh stage in the process of involution\nof consciousness when the full consciousness of God in the man\nstate is now fully withdrawn inwards, so completely that it is now\n124 God Speaks\nﬁxed and focussed onto Himself rather than onto the objects of His\nown creation.\nNow that full consciousness has been fully involved, the ob-\njects of Nothingness, which apparently appeared to exist, vanish\ncompletely together with their impressions.\nWith complete annihilation of impressions of the associations\nof the Nothing, the impressioned consciousness of God in the man\nstate is spontaneously transformed into the unimpressioned or\ni mp ressionless consciousness of God which makes God in the\nman state experience the “passing-a w a y-in” His original state of ab-\nsolute vacuum. It is but natural that the full consciousness, fully\ninvolved, and now free from even the slightest trace of any im-\npression, should give no other experience but that of the original,\nabsolute vacuum state of God which once prevailed and which is\nnow experienced consciously.\nThis full consciousness, fully involved, is the super- c o n s c i o u s n e s s\nor the mahachaitanya. The unconscious God in the original, ab-\nsolute vacuum state is now fully conscious, or super - c o n s c i o u s ,\nof His original state of God in the Beyond the Beyond state.\nThis “passing- a w a y-in” the absolute vacuum of the original\nstate of God is called attaining the fana of the seventh plane of\nc o n s c i o u s n e s s .\nIn Sufi terms fana means “passing- a w a y-in.” Fana has two\nstages: the ﬁrst stage of fana is the conscious experience of the ab-\nsolute vacuum state, and the second stage of fana or f a n a-ﬁllah i s\nthe conscious experience of the “I am God” state.\nF a n a-fillah, the second stage, is the Goal of God in the man\nstate where God in human form, that is, as man, ultimately re a l i z e s\nthe “I am God” state with full consciousness. This is the state of ﬁn a l\nmajzoobiyat as it is termed by the Suﬁs.\nMuch before the ﬁrst stage of fana is attained, God in the man\nstate, as man, had full consciousness of the limited ego or “I,”\nmind, energ y, body and the world in an ord i n a ry awake state, be-\ncause the full consciousness of God in the man state, as man, was\nd i rectly focussed on them through their finite impressions.

When the sub-super-\nconsciousness completely involved, that is, was withdrawn inward s\nt o w a rds Himself, then God in the man state, as man, gained the\nseventh plane of super-consciousness devoid of all impr e s s i o n s .\nThis was the ﬁnal stage in attaining the Goal.\nSimultaneously with the complete involution of conscious-\nness, and on gaining super-consciousness, the mind is ﬁnally com-\npletely annihilated and vanishes once and for all time together\nwith all im p ressions. The false experiences of the limited ego or\n“I,” mind, energ y, body and the world all disappear for e v e r, van-\nishing completely , because all these experiences were but the out-\ncome of the impre ssions generated out of the Nothing, which l i t e r a l l y\nmeant nothing and were nothing.\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, with the vanishing of the limited ego or “I,”\nmind, energ y, body (typifying happiness) and worlds with all of\ntheir corresponding paraphernalia, a state of absolute vacuum is\nspontaneously experienced by the consciousness, which r e m a i n s\ne t e rnally when once it is gained. At this stage God, in the man state\nas man, with full consciousness as super-consciousness, is now only\nconscious of absolute vacuum—the consciousness is now ﬁxed and\nfocussed on “Absolute Vacuum” itself.\nThis vacuum is absolute in its entirety; vacuum alone prevails\nand there is an entire absence of the Nothing as well as of the Ev-\ne rything. This is there f o re called the “Divine, Absolute Va c u u m , ”\nand it is not born of Illusion, but it is born of Reality .\nThis state of divine vacuum prevails just at the instant when\nthe Nothing disappears or vanishes and just immediately before\nthe E v e rything ﬁlls in that vacuum to give conscious experience of\nthe reality of the “I am God” state.\nThis is the ﬁrst stage of fana w h e re all that is of the Nothing van-\nishes completely and where the super-consciousness is focussed\nonly on absolute vacuum, which now prevails as it prevails etern a l l y\nin the original God-Is state of God in original, divine sound sleep.\nT h e re f o re, in the ﬁrst stage of fana the consciousness of God, in\nthe man state as man, is not of the limited self or ego or “I,” mind,\n126 God Speaks\ne n e rg y, body and worlds, nor is the consciousness even of God or\nof the unlimited Self or Ego or “I,” universal mind, unbounded en-\ne rg y, universal body and universes; because, in this first stage of\nfana only the consciousness of absolute vacuum prevails. This vac-\nuum is also divine; it is not of Illusion but it is of Reality . In this ﬁr s t\nstage of fana the super-consciousness of God, in the man state as\nman, experiences the “passing-away-in” the absolute vacuum state\nof the original God-Is state, and is thus conscious now only of ab-\nsolute vacuum.\nAs has already been said, this same absolute vacuum state is\nalso established in the everyday sound sleep state of a normal man\nw h e re the limited ego or “I,” mind, ener g y, body and the worlds\nalso vanish and the consciousness gained remains dormant.\nThe only diff e rence, which truly makes a world of dif f e re n c e ,\nbetween the absolute vacuum state of the everyday sound sleep\nstate of man and the experience of the absolute vacuum in the ﬁr s t\nstage of fana i s ,that although the same absolute vacuum is estab-\nlished also in fana, yet in fana the consciousness no longer re m a i n s\nd o rmant. In this stage it is fully and completely matured con-\nsciousness, now actually experiencing the very same absolute vac-\nuum state as the original state of God.\nThe experience of the ﬁrst stage of fana is of the nirvana state.\nN i rvana is that state where apparently “God Is Not.” This is the\nonly state where “God Is Not” and “Consciousness Is.” This ex-\nperience of the ﬁrst stage of fana is what Buddha emphasized, but\nlater on it was misinterpreted as Buddha having emphasized that\nt h e re was no God. The re a l i t y, however, is that God Is; but in the\nabsolute vacuum state of the ﬁrst stage of fana only consciousness\nremains, experiencing absolute vacuum.\nAs it can never happen for God not to exist, in the state of nir-\nvana God plays the part of consciousness itself, which conscious-\nness is sometimes termed super-consciousness or mahachaitanya.\nThe second stage of fana follows this n i rvana state and the “I\nam God” state is experienced consciously .\nH o w e v e r, it is only in some cases that the ﬁrst stage of fana is im-\nmediately followed by the second stage of fana called “ f a n a - ﬁl l a h ”\nw h e re the annihilated false and limited ego or “I” is replaced by the"

Simultaneously the absolute\nvacuum is automatically ﬁlled by the experience of the Inﬁnite.\nThe super-consciousness of God in the man state, as man, now\nﬁxed and focussed on the unlimited “I,” spontaneously identiﬁ e s\nman with God the Inﬁnite. Simultaneously with the identiﬁc a t i o n ,\nthe super-consciousness of God the Inﬁnite experiences the “I am\nGod” state.

It is because of this that n i rvana is supposed to be the Goal, but the\nfact is that the real Goal for one in human form is to attain n i rvikalpa.

This led God to\nrealize His Self, or made God fully conscious of God-realization. In\nother words, God’s own inﬁnite state was consciously realized by\nGod Himself when He attained the “I am God” state.*\nIn other words, God ﬁrst goes through the becoming process \nin the gross; that is, in the gross, God becomes the body of a n n a\nbhuvan ( g ross sphere). Then in the subtle He becomes the e n e rg y\nof pran bhuvan (subtle sphere). Then in the mental He becomes the\nmind of mano bhuvan (mental sphere). Beyond this in vidnyan, G o d\nbecomes God—that which He was and is and always will be. There-\nf o re God, Who was originally unconscious, now becomes oblivi-\nous of oblivion itself and gets the real and final answer to His\noriginal First W o rd—“Who am I?”—as “I am God.” Thus in the\ng ross, subtle and mental spheres God becomes actually what He re-\nally is not; and in vidnyan He becomes actually what He really i s .\nOriginally God was God; now God has become God.\nJust because God, after “passing-away-in” His original state of\nabsolute vacuum in the first stage of fana, realizes His own infi-\nnite state of “I am God” in the second stage of fana, this fana (i.e.,\nfana-ﬁllah) becomes and is the goal.\nAttainment of this goal means the end of the First Divine Jour-\nn e y, which began with gnosis and which ended, after traversing all\nplanes of consciousness, in deiﬁcation.\nThe second stage of fana i s d e i ﬁcation which means man has\nbecome God. Man now is God and experiences God’s knowledge,\nG o d ’s powers and God’s bliss; but this is not “Perfection” as yet,\na lthough it is the goal. At the second stage of fana or the f a n a -\nﬁllah, which is the end of the ﬁrst divine journ e y, man has e n t e re d\nGod and thus has become God, but has not yet entered God’s life.\nMan at the end of the first divine journey simply realizes that he\nis God and simply experiences the “I am God” state together with\n130 God Speaks\n* The happiness of God-realization is the Goal of all Creation. The real happiness\nwhich comes through realizing God is worth all physical and mental sufferings in\nthe universe. Then all suffering is as if it were not. The happiness of God-re a l i z a t i o n\nis self-sustained, eternally fresh and unfailing, boundless and indescribable; and it\nis for this happiness that the world has sprung into existence.\n\n\nthe experiences of inﬁn i t ep o w e r, knowledge and bliss, and enjoys\nthe state of inﬁnite bliss. \nAfter the Goal is attained at the end of the ﬁrst divine journ e y,\nbut very rarely however, God as man, now in the God state, can leave\ni n ﬁnite bliss and come down to normal consciousness from the\ns u p e r-conscious “I am God” state and begin to experience the state\nof baqa, thus entering the second divine journ e y.\nThe Suﬁ term “baqa” means “abiding-in.”21\nT\no come down to normal consciousness from the super- c o n s c i o u s\n“I am God” state and to experience the “abiding-in” God state\nwould mean getting established in the very life of God. Thus in\nbaqa the life of God in a human being is established. This means\nthat in baqa man establishes himself as God consciously . This con-\nsciousness is called “sulukiyat” or the normal consciousness of b e -\ning “established in the life of God.” Distinct from this is the m a j-\nzoobiyat or “being drowned or absorbed by inﬁnite bliss” in the state\nof “I am God.” Accord i n g l y, God as man, experiencing the state o f\nbaqa, i scalled the real “Salik” in Suﬁ t e rm i n o l o g y. This baqa of Re-\nality and Divinity is called “ b a q a-billah.” In Vedanta it is known\nas “atmapratisthapana.”\nThe Salik not only experiences infinite power and infinite\nknowledge while in inﬁnite bliss, as in majzoobiyat, but, now being\nthe Salik, He consciously accumulates all the inﬁnite power, inﬁ-\nnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss while being established in the life\nof God with the normal consciousness of His sulukiyat.\nBut before finally and really “passing- a w a y-in” the reality of\nthe ultimate f a n a-fillah state with full consciousness completely\nm a t u red, and before getting established in the ﬁnal baqa-billah o f\nDivinity, generally speaking in terms of Illusion, there are as many\nindividualized experiences of fana-baqa as there are varied and in-\nnumerable species and states of life in Creation.\nNevertheless, three fundamental types of fana-baqa include all\nthe individualized experiences of fana-baqa.\nThe first of the three fundamental types is the r u d i m e n t a ry.\nThis type is the f a n a-baqa of the phenomenal, false life in Illusion\nexperienced by all who, daily “passing- a w a y-in” fana, gain b a q a\nto “abide-in” Illusion every day .

When the impressions of Illusion, with\nwhich one goes to sleep, wake one up, one abides in Illusion its e l f\nin the awake state and establishes everyday life in Illusion.\nAccordingly, in everyday life, when one goes into sound sleep,\nfana i sestablished as one daily “passes-a w a y-in” the original God\nstate without consciousness. And when one wakes up daily , baqa \ni sgained to “abide-in” the everyday life of Illusion, as long as\nsound sleep does not overpower and drag one, once again, into the\nstate of the daily fana which is the One’s original, divine state of ab-\nsolute vacuum.\nThe second type of f a n a-baqa is of the planes on the Path to-\nw a rds attainment of the goal and differs from the ru d i m e n t a ry type\nof the ord i n a ry phenomenal, false life in Illusion, although this sec-\nond type of fana-baqa of the planes is also illusion.\nIn every plane, from the first through the sixth plane on the\npath, the full consciousness evolved is being gradually withdrawn\ni n w a rds or involved. Hence the f a n a-baqa of the planes is in ac-\nc o rdance with the impressions impregnating the involving con-\nsciousness and differs from the ﬁrst type of rudimentary fana-baqa\nof the impressioned consciousness that is fully evolved or is still in\nthe process of evolution.\nE v e ry plane on the path towards the goal of f a n a-fillah has its\nf a n a-baqa while the fully evolved consciousness is being grad-\nually involved in conjunction with pr o g ressive advancement in\nthe planes.\nBut the generalized meaning of the Sufi term “fana” is the\n“ p a s s i n g - a w a y-in” the absolute vacuum of the original God-Is state.\nT h e re f o re, whether the fana i sof the ru d i m e n t a ry type of the or-\nd i n a ry phenomenal, false life or of the second type of the planes on\nthe path, it does not make any dif f e rence at all. In both types the\n132 God Speaks\nfana ( “ p a s s i n g-a w a y-in”) is fundamentally the same, for daily in the\nsound sleep state the impressioned consciousness, in both cases,\n“passes-away-in” the same state of absolute vacuum, regardless of\nall the differences in the types of impressions of Illusion.\nAlthough the fana is always the same in both the evolving c o n-\nsciousness and the i n v o l v i n gconsciousness, yet it is the type of im-\np ressions of Illusion with which the consciousness is impre g n a t e d ,\nwhile abiding in Illusion during the awake state, that really mat-\nters, and that does create the diff e rentiation when “passing-away-\nin” the sound sleep state or in the state of fana.\nFor example, the fana of an animal or a cre a t u re in the sound\nsleep state “passing- a w a y-in” the absolute vacuum, with its own\np a rticular impressions of Illusion, differs completely from the f a n a\nof a human being in the sound sleep state “passing- a w a y-in” the\nabsolute vacuum with his own particular impressions of Illusion.\nS i m i l a r l y, the impressions of Illusion of an ord i n a ry human being\nwill be quite different from the impressions of Illusion of a human\nbeing in the planes of the path.\nIn all cases, though the diff e rent types of fana remain always as\nfana, yet the diff e rent impressions impregnating individual con-\nsciousness in the baqa of the awake state give rise to the individu-\nalized fana of each and all species and states of life in Creation.\nIn contrast with that, when the baqa of the individualized life\nis gained in the awake state after the sound sleep state of fana, the\nbaqa, which in Suﬁ t e rms means “abiding-in,” establishes in Illu-\nsion the everyday individualized life of Illusion in accordance with\nthe predominant impressions with which the individualized life\nhad “passed away” from the variety of impressions of Illusion in\nthe state of its individualized fana, in the sound sleep state. As\nsuch, every individualized baqa completely differs from every other\nbaqa, because when this individualized baqa is gained in the awake\nstate, the impressions of the impressioned consciousness of every\nindividualized life are solely responsible for establishing in Illusion\nthe individualized life of Illusion.\nHence it is that in re g u l a r, unfailing succession the fana of Illu-\nsion in the sound sleep state is invariably followed by the baqa o f\nIllusion in the awake state, which in turn gets lost in the inevitable"

It is never stable as long as it is of the Illusion.\nAs long as individualized life does not really and ﬁnally “pass-\naway-in” the f a n a-ﬁllah of Reality and become established in the\nabiding b a q a-billah of Divinity , it is obvious that there are bound \nto be innumerable and diverse types and groups of fana-baqa o f\nIllusion in accordance with the persisting impressions that con-\nsistently impress the evolving and the involving consciousness of\nindividualized life in baqa.\nIn every plane also, from the ﬁrst through the sixth plane of in-\nvolving consciousness, there is bound to be a particular type of\nbaqa for each of the six planes, in accordance with the par t i c u l a r\nimpressions of the Illusion of each plane.\nWhen a man is said to be on the ﬁrst plane his fully evolved con-\nsciousness is beginning to involve, and his full consciousness re-\nmains focussed on the ﬁrst plane of the subtle sphere, because the\ni m p ressions of the first plane consistently impregnating his in-\nvolving consciousness make him abide in the ﬁrst plane and lead\nhim to experience the illusion of this plane. Even though the gro s s\nbody of the man on the first plane is exactly like the gross body\nof a man n o ton the first plane, and though the man on the first\nplane also sleeps and wakes up exactly like an or d i n a ry man of\nthe everyday phenomenal, false life, yet, because his involving con-\nsciousness is directly focussed on the ﬁrst plane, he “passes-away-\nin” the sound sleep state of the ﬁrst plane fana with the impre s s i o n s\nof the illusion of the ﬁrst plane, and wakes up daily to get estab-\nlished in the ﬁrst plane baqa to “abide-in” the ﬁrst plane, and to ex-\nperience the impressions of that plane.\nThe diff e rence between the f a n a-baqa of the man who enters\nthe planes of the path and of the man who is not on the planes\nof the path is that the former can be likened to a man who, after\nliving for many years in a certain place, severs all of his past con-\nnections and sets out on a world tour, travelling from one place to\na n o t h e r, crossing continents one after the other. Although this\n134 God Speaks\nman would be daily going to sleep, and awakening the next day , as\nhe was accustomed to sleeping and awakening every day in his\nﬁrst habitat, yet now in the course of his world tour he would be\n“ p a s sing-away-in” sound sleep and would be daily waking up evi-\ndently with the predominant impressions of his completely\nchanged environments and novel experiences.22\nIn short\n, he who enters the ﬁrst plane of involving conscious-\nness eventually experiences the ﬁrst plane fully . This man, who is\ngetting established in the ﬁrst plane, establishes his living in this\n“world of his own” and there f o re he sleeps in this plane and wakes\nup every day in this plane as well. In exactly the same way , all in-\ndividualized consciousness in all other planes “passes-a w a y-in” the\nfana of those particular planes to wake up in such planes and es-\ntablish the everyday life baqa in these particular planes.\nN e v e rtheless, the f a n a-baqa of every plane of the path is fun-\ndamentally of the same type, because it pertains only to conscious-\nness that is involving gradually and not to that of the evolving n o r\nof the evolved consciousness. Whatever dif f e rence there is to dif-\nf e rentiate the f a n a-baqa of one plane from another plane would\nonly be such as would exist between two men living on two dif-\nf e rent continents of the same earth and having their own individ-\nual impressions of that particular part of the earth on which each\nlives. The man in America has his own impressions and relative ex-\nperiences of his individualized life; the same is true of the man in\nAsia who has his own impressions and experiences related to his\ncontinent which is quite different from America.\nBut the fundamental fact remains that both men live on the\nsame earth. Despite the vast diff e rence between the impressions and\nthe consequent experiences of these two men, yet when both sleep,\nthey both “pass-a w a y-in” sound sleep. And, whether one sleeps on\na bed of velvet and the other on a bed of hay , it is quite immaterial\nwhen both can equally enjoy the same sound sleep state. In like\nm a n n e r, when both wake up they both can live their individual lives\nin illusion on the same earth, irrespective of the diff e rence in their\ni m p ressions and their consequent relative experiences due to living\non diff e rent continents.

This means that the inﬁnite, eternal, formless God ﬁnds Him-\nself as ﬁnite, mortal and having gross form. The cause of this igno-\nrance is but the impressions—sanskaras.\nSo God, Who is eternally in the Beyond the Beyond state of\nParatpar Parabrahma or in the inﬁnitude state of God-Is, in the be-\nginning acquires ignorance through being impressed by the im-\npressions rather than by acquiring knowledge of His reality .\nHence when God acquires a particular form, body or sharir a c-\nc o rding to particular impressions, He feels and experiences Him-\nself as that particular form, body or s h a r i r. God in His stone-f o rm\nexperiences Himself as stone. Accord i n g l y, in consonance with im-\npressions and their consciousness, God feels and experiences that\nHe is metal, vegetation, worm, ﬁsh, bird, animal or human being.\nWhatever be the type of the gross form and whatever be the shape\nof the form, the evolving consciousness of God tends God spon-\ntaneously to associate Himself with that form, figure and shape\nwhich tends Him to experience Himself through impressions that\nHe is that form, ﬁgure and shape.\nS i m i l a r l y, when God is conscious of the subtle body (i.e., t h e\npran) then God experiences the subtle world and r e g a rds Him-\nself as the subtle body or pran. Likewise, God becomes conscious\nof the mental body ( i.e., the mana or the mind), experiences the\nmental world and re g a rds Himself as the mental body or the m a n a\n(i.e., the mind).\nIt is only because of impressions that the inﬁnite God, the Over-\nSoul, without form and inﬁnite, experiences that He is veritably but\na finite gross body in the gross sphere (i.e., the j i v-atma in a n n a\n144 God Speaks\nb h uv a n), or a subtle body in the subtle sphere (i.e., the jiv-atma i n\npran bhuvan), or a mental body in the mental sphere (i.e., the j i v -\natma in the mano bhuvan). God, while experiencing the gross world\nt h rough gross forms, associates with and dissociates from innu-\nm e rable gross forms. The association with and dissociation fr o m\ngross forms are called “birth” and “death,” respectively .\nIt is because of impressions that the eternal, immortal, form l e s s\nGod, or the Over-Soul, without births and deaths, has to experience\nb i rths and deaths a number of times. While God has toe x p e r i e n c e\nthese innumerable births and deaths because of impressions, He has\nnot only to experience the gross world which is ﬁnite and there f o re\nfalse, but together with it He has also to experience its happiness\nand misery , its virtue and vice.\nAll forms, ﬁg u res and shapes, all worlds and planes, all birt h s\nand deaths, all virtue and vice, all happiness and misery , experi-\nenced by God, Who is eternal, formless and inﬁnite, are the out-\ncome of impressioned consciousness. Since all impressions areb u t\nthe outcome of the Nothing that manifested as the Nothingness,\nit means that whatever God experiences through His evolved con-\nsciousness in the gross, subtle and mental worlds is the experience\nof the Nothing; and as this Nothing by nature is nothing, there f o re\nall the experiences in the inter m e d i a ry illusory states of God are\nnothing but literally illusion and, as such, false and ﬁnite.\nOnly when the impressioned consciousness is freed from all\ni m p ressions is liberation or mukti in human form attained as n i r-\nvana or fana, w h e re only consciousness “Is” and where all else of\nthe Nothing, which was as Nothingness, vanishes for e v e r. Only\nin the case of the one who retains the body* for three to four days†\nafter nirvana does the liberated (or the unimpressioned or impres-\nsi\nonless) consciousness invariably realize eternal Godhood in the\nsecond stage of fana (i.e., in f a n a-fillah) and assert itself as “I am\nGod” without doubt.

It follows then that this iota\nof ocean, when in the limitless ocean, is ocean itself before sepa-\nration, and was in the unlimited ocean not as an iota of the ocean\nbut as the ocean itself (because every iota of ocean when not lim-\nited by the limitations of being an iota is unlimited ocean itself).\nIt is only when the iota of the ocean is separated from the un-\nlimited ocean, or is taken out of the unlimited ocean, as a drop, that\nthis separated iota of the ocean is looked upon as the limited drop\nof the unlimited ocean.\nIn other words, the inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean now\nis made to look upon itself through the drop as merely the limited\n146 God Speaks\nd rop of that inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean; and in com-\nparison to the inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean, this drop of\nocean is most ﬁnite, most limited, and has now inﬁnite limitations.\nS i m i l a r l y, atma, as compared to the drop of the inﬁnite ocean, can\nnever be out of any limitations of the limitless and inﬁnite P a r a m-\na t m aas compared to the inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean.\nBut just as the iota of ocean acquires its limitations as a dr o p\nt h rough a bubble on the surface of the ocean, and just as this bubble\nbestows upon the iota of the ocean an apparent separative and lim-\nited existence apart from the inﬁnite ocean, likewise atma, w h i c h\nis not only in Paramatma but which is Paramatma Itself, appare n t l y\nexperiences and asserts separative existence from the inﬁnite, un-\nlimited Paramatma t h rough the limitations of the bubble of im-\np ressions, which bestow conscious ignorance, and with which a t m a\ns h rouds itself and experiences itself as limited and separate fr o m\nParamatma.\nT h rough these limitations, formed by the bubble of impr e s-\nsions, self-c reated by atma, atma a p p a rently inherits a separative\nand limited existence from P a r a m a t m a ,and because of this self-\ncreated separativeness from inﬁnite Paramatma, atma, which is It-\nself infinite, unlimited and unbounded, bestows upon Itself the\naspects of being most finite and most limited, with infinite limi-\ntations acquired through impressions.\nAs soon as the bubble of impressions bursts on completion of"

When people actually see him ill they do not see him ill but\nin reality they see his illness p e rfectly enacted because he is the\nPerfect Master and perfection personiﬁed; he acts as if he were ill.\nOn the other hand, when people see the Avatar ill, He has a c t u-\nally fallen ill and He has literally become ill.

There-\nf o re the term for the fifty-six God-realized ones may be “Per f e c t\nOnes” but not Perfect Masters or Sadgurus or Qutubs.\nOut of the ﬁfty-six Perfect Ones or Shiv-Atmas in human form,\nt h e re are always at all times in all ages, five Perfect Masters or \nS a d g u rus or Qutubs; and these ﬁve control the affairs of the whole\nuniverse.\nWhen the age is not of the Avataric period, these ﬁve Per f e c t\nMasters conjointly look to the affairs of the universe, and the one\nf rom amongst the ﬁve Perfect Masters who is responsible for the\nc o n t rol of all of the affairs of the whole universe is called by the Suﬁs\n“ Q u t u b-e-I r s h a d . ”\nBut, when the age is of the Avataric period at the end of every\nc y c l e ,* the Avatar (Ancient One, the Highest of the High), the Inde-\npendent Reality (Inﬁnite Consciousness of the Beyond state of God),\nis made to manifest in Illusion directly on the earth through a male\nhuman being.

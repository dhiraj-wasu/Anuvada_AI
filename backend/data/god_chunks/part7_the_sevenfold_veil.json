    "text": "Kabir and other Perfect Masters emphasize that miracles and yogic powers have no spiritual value. True divine love alone burns away desires without display. Both the world and the spiritual path are forms of illusion—false illusion and real illusion—while God alone is the only Reality. Knowledge removes ignorance, but Truth remains hidden until the soul enters the divine path."

    "text": "The apparent separation between man and God is described as a sevenfold veil. This veil consists of seven folds tied by seven knots, representing seven root desires and seven fundamental impressions connected with the seven sensory openings of the face. These folds of ignorance conceal man’s real identity as God."

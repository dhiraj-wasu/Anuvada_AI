All these are experiences of\nthe gross sphere.\nSouls with subtle impressions experience successively thr e e\nplanes of the subtle sphere through the subtle body , and in these\nt h ree planes they have only the experiences of seeing, smelling\nand hearing.\nSouls with mental impressions, through the mental body or\nmind, in the mental sphere experience only seeing, and this seeing\nis the seeing of God.\nSouls having no impressions, through the Self experience the in-\nﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that is conscious of the gross body is n o tconscious of\nthe subtle body , n o tconscious of the mental body , and n o tc o n-\nscious of Self.\nThe soul that is conscious of the subtle body is n o tc o n s c i o u s\nof the gross body , n o tconscious of the mental body , and n o tc o n-\nscious of Self.\nThe soul that is conscious of the mental body is not conscious\nof the gross body , n o tconscious of the subtle body , and n o tc o n-\nscious of Self.\nThe soul that is conscious of Self is not conscious of the gross\nb o d y, not conscious of the subtle body , and not conscious of the\nmental body .\nThe soul that has experience of the gross world does not have\ne xperience of the subtle world, nor experience of the mental world,\nnor does it have experience of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that has experience of the subtle world does not expe-\nrience the gross world, nor does it have experience of the mental\nworld, nor does it have experience of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that has experience of the mental world does not ex-\nperience the gross world, nor does it experience the subtle world,\nnor does it have experience of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that has experience of the Over-Soul does note x p e r i-\nence the gross world, nor does it experience the subtle world, nor\nStates of Consciousness 3\n\ndoes it experience the mental world. That is, the soul that is con-\nscious of Self and has experience of the Over-Soul is not conscious\nof the gross body , subtle body and mental body and does not expe-\nrience the gross, subtle and mental spheres (worlds).\nThis means that in order to have consciousness of Self and to\nhave the experience of the Over-Soul, the soul must lose conscious-\nness of the gross, subtle and mental bodies. But as long as the soul\nis impressioned either by the gross, subtle or mental impre s s i o n s ,\nthe soul consistently and respectively has consciousness of the gro s s\nb o d y, subtle body or mental body , and the gross, subtle and men-\ntal experiences are persistently and necessarily underg o n e .\nThe obvious reason for this is that as long as the consciousness\nof the soul is impressed by gross impressions, there is no way out ex-\ncept to experience these gross impressions through the gross body .\nSimilarly, as long as the consciousness of the soul is impressed\nby subtle impressions, there is no way out but to experience these\nsubtle impressions through the subtle body .\nSimilarly, as long as the consciousness of the soul is impressed\nby mental impressions, there is no escape but to experience these\nmental impressions through the mental body .\nAs impressions of the gross, subtle and mental vanish or com-\npletely disappear, the consciousness of the soul is automatically and\nobviously directed and focussed towards itself, and this soul then nec-\nessarily has no alternative but to absorb experience of the Over- S o u l .\nN o w, gross, subtle and mental bodies are nothing but the s h a d-\nows of the soul. The gross, subtle and mental spheres (worlds) are\nnothing but the shadows of the Over-Soul.\nG ross, subtle and mental bodies are ﬁnite, have forms and are\nchangeable and destructible. The gross, subtle and mental worlds\na re false; they are zero, imagination and vacant dreams. The only re-\nality is the Over-Soul ( P a r a m a t m a ) .\nT h e re f o re when the soul with its gross, subtle and mental bod-\nies experiences the gross, subtle and mental worlds, the soul actually\nexperiences in reality the shadows of the Over-Soul with the help\nof its own shadows.\nIn other words, the soul with its ﬁnite and destructible form ex-\nperiences falsity , zero, imagination and a vacant dream.\n4 God Speaks\n\nOnly when the soul experiences the Over-Soul with its Self\ndoes it experience the Real with reality .\nWhen the soul is conscious of its gross body , then this soul iden-\nt i ﬁes itself with the gross body and takes itself as the gross body .\nThis means that the inﬁnite, eternal, formless soul ﬁnds itself\nas ﬁnite, mortal and having form.\nImpressions (sanskaras) are the cause of this ignorance. In the\nbeginning the soul, which is eternally in the Over-Soul, at first\na cq u i res ignorance through impressions rather than acquiring\nKnowledge.\nWhen the soul acquires a particular form (body or s h a r i r) a c-\ncording to particular impressions, it feels and experiences itself as\nbeing that particular form.\nSoul in its stone-form experiences itself as stone. Accordingly ,\nin due course, the soul experiences and feels that it is metal, vege-\ntable, worm, ﬁsh, bird, animal, man or woman. Whatever be thet y p e\nof gross form and whatever be the shape of the form, the soul spon-\ntaneously associates itself with that form, ﬁg u re and shape, and ex-\nperiences that it is itself that form, ﬁgure and shape.\nWhen the soul is conscious of the subtle body , then this soul\nexperiences that it is the subtle body .\nWhen the soul becomes conscious of the mental body , then this\nsoul experiences that it is the mental body .\nIt is only because of impressions (nuqush-e-amal or s a n s k a r a s )\nthat the soul without form, the Inﬁnite Soul, experiences that it is\nveritably a g ross body (sthul sharir), or a subtle body (pran) or a\nmental body (mana or mind).\nThe soul, while experiencing the gross world through gr o s s\nf o rms, associates with and dissociates from innumerable gr o s s\nf o rms. The association with and dissociation from gross forms are\ntermed birth and death respectively .\nIt is only because of impressions that the eternal, immor t a l\nsoul, existing in reality without births and without deaths, has to\nexperience births and deaths innumerable times.\nWhile the soul has to undergo this experience of innumerable\nb i rths and deaths because of impressions, it has not only to experi-\nence the gross world, which is a shadow of the Over-Soul and which\nStates of Consciousness 5\n\nis false, but together with it the soul has also to experience the hap-\npiness and misery , virtue and vice of the gross world.\nIt is only because of impressions that the soul, which is beyond\nand free from happiness and misery , virtue and vice, has necessarily\nto undergo experiences of misery and happiness, vice and virt u e .\nNow this much is established, that the experiences of bir t h s\nand deaths, happiness and misery , virtue and vice are experienced\nonly by the gross form of the soul while experiencing the gr o s s\nworld; but the gross form of the soul is a shadow of the soul and\nthe gross world is a shadow of the Over-Soul.\nThus all the experiences of births and deaths, virtue and vice,\nhappiness and misery experienced by the soul are nothing but the\nexperiences of the shadow . Hence all that is thus experienced is false.\nAtma in Reality Is Paramatma\nIn order to clarify the relationship of “atma-Paramatma” we com-\np a re Paramatma with an inﬁnite ocean, a limitless ocean, and the\natma as a drop in this ocean. The atma i snever out of this limitless\nocean ( P a r a m a t m a ) .\nThe atma can never be out of Paramatma because Paramatma i s\ni n ﬁnite and unlimited. How can the atma come out of, or have a\nplace beyond, the limitlessness of the limitless? There f o re the a t m a\nis in P a r a m a t m a .\nAfter establishing the primary fact that the atma is i nP a r a m-\natma we go a step further and say that atma i sParamatma. H o w ?\nFor example, let us imagine an unlimited ocean. Let us also\nimagine that we separate or take out one iota of ocean from the lim-\nitless expanse of this unlimited ocean. It follows then that this iota\nof ocean, while in the limitless ocean, before separation is ocean\ni tself, and is not there in the shoreless ocean as an iota of the ocean,\nbecause every iota of ocean, when not limited by the limitations\nof a drop, is unlimited ocean.\nIt is only when an iota of ocean is separated from the unlim-\nited ocean, or is taken out of the unlimited ocean as a drop, that this\niota of ocean obtains its separate existence as a drop of the shore l e s s\n6 God Speaks\n\nocean, and that this iota of ocean begins to be looked upon as a dro p\nof the unlimited ocean.\nIn other words, the inﬁnite, unlimited and limitless ocean itself\nis now looked upon as merely a drop of that inﬁnite, unlimited and\nlimitless ocean. And in comparison to that inﬁnite, unlimited and\nlimitless ocean this iota of ocean, or this drop of the iota of ocean,\nis most ﬁnite and most limited with inﬁnite limitations. That is, the\ninﬁnitely free iota ﬁnds itself inﬁnitely bound.\nS i m i l a r l y, the atma, which we have compared with a drop of\nthe inﬁnite ocean, obtains a seeming separate existence, though in\nreality it can never be out of the limitlessness of the limitless, inﬁn i t e\nParamatma which we have compared with the inﬁnite, unlimited\nand limitless ocean.\nBut just as the iota of ocean acquires its limitation as a drop\nt h rough being in the form of a bubble on the surface of the ocean, and\nthe bubble bestows upon the iota of ocean an apparently separative\nexistence from the inﬁnite ocean, likewise the atma, which is i n\nP a r amatma and is Paramatma, a p p a rently experiences separative\nexistence from the inﬁnite Paramatma t h rough the limitations of\na bubble (of ignorance) with which the atma s h rouds itself. No\nsooner does the bubble of ignorance burst, than the atma not only\nﬁnds itself in Paramatma but experiences itself as Paramatma.\nT h rough this limitation, formed by the bubble of ignorance,\ns e l f - c reated by the atma, the atma a p p a rently inherits a separative\nexistence from Paramatma. And because of this self-created sepa-\nrativeness from inﬁnite Paramatma, the atma, which is itself inﬁ-\nnite, unlimited and limitless, apparently experiences itself as most\nﬁnite with inﬁnite limitations.\nStates of Consciousness 7",

When\nconsciousness ﬁrst begins to involve it means that the human being\nis only beginning to take the ﬁrst step on the spiritual path.\nBetween the time of the ﬁrst human incarnation and the time of\ngoing on the path, the complete consciousness of a human being,\nwhich is still an impressioned consciousness, has necessarily to in-\ndulge in a process that eventually must dislodge these impre s s i o n s\nf rom retaining their hold on it (the consciousness which is complete).\nIt is to be noted that during that period, which covers thou-\nsands of re i n c a rnations, the impressions which were hard-set or\ndense get shaken up so thoroughly by the r e i n c a rnation pro c e s s\nthat their tight grip on consciousness becomes loose. These hard -\nset (dense or gross) impressions thin out or become feeble thro u g h\ninnumerable and varied experiences of opposites. The limit to\nthese experiences is reached by persistent r e i n c a rnations which\ngive experiences of opposites.\nIt is also to be noted that it is only when these dense, hard-set\nor gross impressions become less dense or become feeble, that the\nlimit to the experiences of the gross world through gross impr e s-\nsions is reached by the gross medium, the human body. When the\ndense, hard-set impressions become less dense, they no longer give\nrise to gross experiences because these less dense (feeble) impre s-\nsions are re ﬁned or ﬁne and no longer crude or gross.

This readiness results fr o m\nthe swinging of the terrible pendulum from pain to pleasure and\np l e a s u re to pain, in the countless forms of evolution and in the\ncountless entrances and exits through the doors of birth and death\nexperienced during reincarnation. Because this spirit of renuncia-\ntion is latent, it needs only some exciting cause to bring it to the\ns u rface, and it is only when it comes to the surface that we are able\nto see the power and nature of the latent spirit.\nIf the latent spirit is simply a spiritual indigestion from a tem-\nporary surfeit of pain, combined with a mild desire for something\nm o re pleasant, the overt renunciation will be only of a ﬂeeting and\nfeeble kind, a mere temporary escape from unpleasantness. At its\nbest however, this latent spirit is a secret pact of aggression between\nan incurable disgust for the world and an ardent and burning thirst\nfor God. When it comes to the surface it shows itself as an invin-\ncible determination to marshal the entire being to the attainment\n194 God Speaks Supplement\nof victory over the lower self, and to reject everything that is ir-\nrelevant to this great and terrible struggle. Note this word “reject”;\nit means that such a pilgrim casts aside irrelevancies. We might call\nrenunciation the fruit of the ﬂower of spiritual longing, fer t i l i z e d\nby the pollen of disgust for the futility of endless births and deaths.\nOnce renunciation expresses itself there are many ways of look-\ning at it, of which the simplest is to divide it into two main types,\ninternal and external.\nExternal renunciation means giving up completely all worldly\ndelights and physical attachments to material things. In the early\nstages, this renunciation is helpful to the extent to which it leads\nto internal renunciation and preoccupation with God. Tens of\nthousands of so-called sanyasis ( renunciators) are to be found in\nIndia, of whom far too many have adopted this external renuncia-\ntion only as a profession that enables them to indulge in an un-\np roductive life of idleness. External renunciation, however, can\nbe and often is real. When this is so it will inevitably lead on to\ni n t e rnal renunciation, and this is the renunciation that matters. In-\nt e rnal renunciation means the control of desires at their very sourc e\nso that the mind does not fall a prey to the demands of lust, greed\nand anger. This does not mean that one shall cease at once to have\nsuch thoughts. This is impossible, as such thoughts will continue\nto be troublesome as long as the s a n s k a r a sf rom which they arise\nare part of one’s being. The ﬁght is necessarily hard and long.\nFor the West in part i c u l a r, external renunciation is inadvisable\nand impracticable. It should be internal and of the mind from the\ns t a rt. One should live in the world, per f o rm all legitimate duties\nand yet feel mentally detached from everything. One should be in\nthe world but not of it. The Suﬁs say , “Dil ba yar , dast bikar ”( T h e\nheart with God; the hands for work).\nHazrat Nizamuddin Awliya, the Perfect Master of Delhi, was\nonce asked by a visitor how one should live in the world. At that\nm oment it so happened that a few women were passing by with\npitchers of water balanced on their heads, and, as they walked, they\ngossiped and gesticulated. Pointing to them Nizamuddin said,\n“Look at those women—t h a t ’s how you should live in the world.”\n2  Practical Mysticism 195\nAsked to explain this cryptic remark, the Master continued, “These\nwomen re t u rning from the well with pitchers balanced on their\nheads seem to be thinking of nothing else but exchanging tid-bits\nof gossip with each other; and yet they are all the time concentrating\non something far more important, on balancing the pitchers on\ntheir heads. Thus, whatever your body , your senses or the pure l y\nsurface part of your mind may be occupied with, see that the root\nof your mind is constantly focussed on God.”\nVaitag and V airagya\nIf we look upon renunciation as being a state of mind, we can\nunderstand how this state of mind may be either temporary or per-\nmanent. The former is known as vaitag and the latter as vairagya.\nVaitag(temporary renunciation) is simply a temporary disgust\nfor the world and its affairs resulting from some shock, disap-\npointment or loss, combined with a vague desire for God; or it may\ncome from a sudden impulse. In vaitag the mind turns away from\nthe world and takes to godly ways; but this attitude is not lasting,\nand the mind re t u rns to its old ways as soon as circumstances alter,\nor as soon as the impulse dies down. \nVa i r a g y a( i rrevocable renunciation) however is an attitude of\nmind involving such a longing for God and such a deep indif f e r-\nence to things worldly that, once roused, it knows no re t reat and is\nproof against all temptations to give it up. The famous example of\nGautama Buddha is illustrative of vairagya.\nWe have already explained that renunciation is the overt expre s-\nsion of a latent desire for union with God combined with a latent\ns p irit of disgust for the world, and we used an analogy of flower,\npollen and fruit. As far as fertilization is concerned the ﬂower and\nthe pollen by themselves are helpless, for the two can only be\nb rought together by some outside agency , such as the wind, the bee\nor the insect. Whether or not fertilization takes place in nature may\ndepend upon so many thousands of unknown factors that mod-\nern science gives up trying to predict it, and labels it chance. That,\nh o w e v e r, is beside the point at the moment, and in our analogy we\nshall think of this fertilization as a gift.\n196 God Speaks Supplement\nTo re t u rn to v a i r a g y a ,let us remember that the longing for\nunion with God is latent in e v e ry living being. However, it only\npushes its way into consciousness when the soul approaches the\nbeginning of what Meher Baba, in the “Divine Theme,” calls “the re-\nalization p rocess.” The disgust for the world is also something that\ndevelops naturally in all of us and which grows more and more\np o w e rful as we draw nearer to the beginning of this r e a l i z a t i o n\np rocess. When the ﬂower is in full bloom and the pollen ripe, the\nwind or the bee gives the gift of fertilization that produces the fru i t .\nIn the same way also, when this moment of inner readiness comes,\na divine gift descends upon the soul which fertilizes the longing for\nGod and the disgust or indif f e rence for the world, and so brings\nabout the priceless fruit of v a i r a g y a. This divine gift may be a touch\nof inner grace from the indwelling God, or it may be the result of\ncontact with a saint or a Perfect Master. But it is always a gift.\nVairagya,when it ﬁrst becomes manifest, will almost certainly\ne x p ress itself for a time as an external renunciation. But v a i r a g y a ,\nbeing permanent, will always lead sooner or later to the real re-\nn u nciation which is intern a l .\nWhen an aspirant has such an intense longing for Truth he is\nqualified to enter the Path. There is a story of a Master who was\np e s t e red by a disciple as to when he would realize God. Once when\nthey went to bathe in a river the Master held the aspirant under\nwater for a few moments. When the disciple was on the verge of\ns u ffocation the Master pulled him out and asked what he had\nthought of and longed for most while under the water. The aspirant\nreplied, “Air.” The Master explained that when the disciple had just\nas intense a longing for God then Realization would come. Maulana\nRumi says:\nAb kamju, tishnigi avar bidast.\n“Call out for water less, but create thirst for it more.”\nIn the words of Meher Baba, “The Path begins with a conscious\nlonging for a deeper reality. As the ﬁsh which is taken out of water\nlongs to go back to the water, so the aspirant who has sensed the\nGoal longs to be united with God.\n2  Practical Mysticism 197\n“In fact, the longing to go back to the Source is present in each\nbeing from the very time that it gets separated from the Source by\nthe veil of ignorance, but it is unconscious till the aspirant enters\nthe Path.”*\nThe Suﬁs call this attitude of mind “ t a u b a ”meaning re p e n t a n c e\nand implying the turning away from or renouncing of the life of the\nsenses for the life of the spirit. One who has taken this great step\ndoes not look back again at that which he has left behind.",

Ed.]\n2  Practical Mysticism 199\nSpiritually speaking, subtle means something completely dif-\nf e rent from the physical, however attenuated physical things may\nbe. Although the gross sphere is the outcome of the subtle sphere\nand is dependent on it, the subtle sphere is completely independent\nof the gross sphere. As an example, we may take the act of eating.\nThe gross act is the outcome of the thought, and depends upon it;\nbut the thought is independent of the physical act.\nForgetfulness\nThe whole philosophy of approaching and realizing the Tru t h\nhinges on the question of what we may call forgetfulness. The word\n“ f o rgetfulness” used here must not be associated with its commonly\naccepted meaning of forgetting to post a letter, or of a state of mind\nthat is simply dull and blank. Forgetfulness in this special sense is\nan attitude of mind that develops gradually into spiritual experi-\nence. External renunciation is not forgetfulness, because it is mostly\nphysical and partly mental; but internal renunciation, when it be-\ncomes purely mental, does assume the quality and dignity of for-\ngetfulness. Thus one may renounce the world, but it is not so easy\nto forget it.\nF o rgetfulness in this special sense thus explains the secr e t\nthat lies behind all happiness, spiritual or otherwise, that human\nbeings experience. The Suﬁ t e rm for this forgetfulness is b i k h u d i ,\nand it should not be mixed up—though it often is—with b i h o s h i\n( u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s ) .\nThe diff e rence between forgetfulness and unconsciousness is\ni m p o rtant, and a few examples of types of unconsciousness will help\nto make it clear. To begin with, one must remember that forgetful-\nness is the partial or total detachment of the mind from the phys i c a l\nworld, and unconsciousness the partial or total deadening of t h e\nmind to the physical world. The former gives rise to various degre e s\nof spiritual ecstasy and the latter to various degrees of cessation of\npleasure and pain.\nLet us then look at one or two examples of unconsciousness. In\np e rfect health one does not bother about the functioning of a vital\no rgan like the heart. This means that one forgets that this or g a n\n200 God Speaks Supplement\nis beating ceaselessly and perfectly in the human body for the\nmaintenance of life and health. If, however, there is a disturbance\nin the cardiac rhythm there is immediate discomfort, and if there is\na cardiac infarct there is immediate pre c o rdial pain. In either case\none is reminded that one has a heart. The sensation of discomfort\nor pain, though it arises from the heart, is felt only because of the\nfunctioning of the mind. The more the mind is directed to the\nh e a rt, the more the discomfort or pain is felt. When pain r e a c h e s\nits climax, unconsciousness may supervene—a break in the thre a d s\nof consciousness that enables one to forget the pain. But this is un-\nconsciousness and not forgetfulness in its spiritual sense. A surg e o n\nby perf o rming a pre f rontal leucotomy can interf e re with some of the\nn e rvous pathways that serve this focussing of the mind on the in-\ntractable pain of some incurable disease like cancer. After this o p-\neration the pain is still there, but the patient ceases to direct his mind\nt o w a rds it, and so ceases to bother about it. This again is a part i a l\nunconsciousness brought about by purely physical means, and not\nt rue forgetfulness in its spiritual sense. Sleep is a state of uncon-\nsciousness that aff o rds a temporary respite from the wear and tear\nof life; but sleep is not true forgetfulness in its spiritual sense.\nThe whole philosophy of happiness and unhappiness there f o re\nhinges on the question of forgetfulness of some kind or another,\nand of remembrance of some kind or another. Remembrance is an\nattachment of the mind to a particular idea, person, thing or place,\nand forgetfulness is its opposite. Once it is understood that re m e m-\nbrance causes pain, it follows that the only cure is some kind of for-\ngetfulness, and this forgetfulness may be either positive or nega-\ntive. The positive forgetfulness is one in which the mind r e m a i n s\na w a re of external stimuli, but refuses to react to them. The nega-\ntive forgetfulness is either mere unconsciousness—a stopping of\nthe mind as in sound sleep—or an acceleration of it as in madness,\nwhich has been defined as a way of avoiding the memory of suf-\nfering. Either sleep or madness may be artiﬁcially induced in vari-\nous degrees by the use of intoxicants or drugs; but this also is a\nnegative way of overcoming remembrance.\nPositive forgetfulness, then, is the cure, and its steady culti-\nvation develops in man that balance of mind which enables him to\n2  Practical Mysticism 201\ne x p ress such noble traits as charity , forgiveness, tolerance, self-\nlessness and service to others. One who is not equipped with this\npositive forgetfulness becomes a barometer of his surr o u n d i n g s .\nHis poise is disturbed by the slightest whisper of praise or ﬂattery ,\nand by the faintest suggestion of slander or criticism; his mind is\nlike a slender reed swayed by the lightest breeze of emotion. Such\na man is perpetually at war with himself and knows no peace.\nIn the exercise of this positive forgetfulness, not only is non-\nreaction to adverse circumstances essential, but also non-re a c t i o n\nto favourable and pleasurable circumstances. Of these two the lat-\nter is the harder and is less often described, although it matters just\nas much.\nPositive forgetfulness, although it lies at the very root of hap-\npiness, is by no means easy to acquire. Once a man attains this state\nof mind, however, he rises above pain and pleasure; he is master\nof himself. This forgetfulness, to be fully effective for the spiritual\nlife, must become permanent, and such permanence is only ac-\nq u i red through constant practice during many lives. Some people,\nas a result of eff o rts towards forgetfulness in past lives, get spon-\ntaneous and temporary flashes of it in a later life, and it is such\npeople who give to the world the best in poetry , art and philos-\nophy , and who make the greatest discoveries in science.\nIn such moments of true forgetfulness there is a mental de-\ntachment from all material surroundings in which the poet allows\nhis imagination to soar. An artist, when he gives form to an ideal in\nwhich he completely forgets himself and all irrelevant surr o u n d-\nings, creates a masterpiece. The best of philosophy is uttered when\na man surveys the problem of life without reference to the ups and\ndowns of his purely personal circumstances; and some of the gre a t-\nest scientific discoveries have been made in this same frame of\nmind. Such manifestations of genuine spontaneity of forg e t f u l n e s s\na re very rare indeed, and although it is said that poets, artists and\nphilosophers are born and not made, these ﬂeeting phases of r e a l\nforgetfulness are the result of efforts made in past lives.\nIn an attempt to make life bearable some people develop a feeble\nkind of stoicism—a sort of “who cares, anyway” outlook—and oth-\ners plunge recklessly into epicurism. The former is the apathetic\nacceptance of defeat, and the latter the eff o rt to forget defeat in the\na rms of pleasure. Neither is true forgetfulness. But when a man\na cq u i res the true forgetfulness, he enters the spiritual kingdom a n d\npasses through diff e rent degrees of forgetfulness until the Goal is\nreached. Meher Baba tells us, “Forgetfulness of the world makes\none a pilgrim ( r a h r a v, sadhak); f o rgetfulness of the next world\nmakes one a saint; forgetfulness of self means Realization; and for-\ngetfulness of forgetfulness is Perfection.”\n3",

It is very difﬁcult to\npass out of this state of enchantment if the pilgrim once stops\nt h e re, although most pilgrims pass directly from the third to the\nf o u rth plane. Unless the pilgrim gets out of this state quickly and\np roceeds onwards to the fourth plane, his pro g ress will be held up\n204 God Speaks Supplement\ni nd e f i n i t e l y. Once a pilgrim becomes thus enchanted he r e m a i n s\nso for days, months or years together. He can neither make furt h e r\np rog ress nor can he re t ro g ress. He is neither gro s s-conscious nor\ns u b t l e -conscious. Neither can he be calledunconscious because he\nis fully conscious of the enchantment, and it is because of this con-\nsciousness of the enchantment that he lives this living death.\nThe physical condition of the deeply enchanted pilgrim is no\nless strange, for if he seats himself in a particular position, he re-\nmains in that position for months or years together. Similarly , if he\nbecomes enchanted while standing, he will continue standing until\nthe enchantment ends. In short, he remains stationary in the po-\nsition in which he ﬁrst becomes enchanted, and, although he may\nappear to be a lifeless statue, he is in fact more alive than the or-\ndinary man of the world.\nIt is well known to the Suﬁ world how Ali Ahmed Sabir of Piran\nK a l y a r, who after w a rds became a Perfect Master, once r e m a i n e d\nstanding for years near a certain tree. During this period Sabir’s\nmind was absorbed in the enchantment of thism u q a m-e - h a i r a ta n d\nhe was delivered from it by a Q u t u b. Only natural death or divine\nhelp from a living Master can help such a dazed pilgrim out of his\nspiritual stalemate. A Master would help such a pilgrim either by\nbringing him back to the third plane or by pushing him onwards.\nH a ﬁz no doubt thinks of this stage of the pilgrim when he says:\nMastam kun an cunan kih nadanam zi biKvudi\nDar ’arsih Kiyal kih amad kudam raft.\n“Make me so dazed and intoxicated that, on account of this\nstate of forgetfulness, I should be oblivious of what came\ninto my mind and of what passed out of it.”\nMeher Baba explains that a pilgrim runs the risk of entering\nm u q a m - e - h a i r a t(state of enchantment) when he passes from the\nt h i rd to the fourth plane. There are, he says, states of enchantment\non other parts of the Path also, but the most important is that be-\ntween the third and the fourth planes. This h a i r a t( e n c h a n t m e n t )\nmay be strong or feeble. If there is no hitch or disturbing factor pre s-\nent at the moment that a pilgrim becomes enchanted, then the\nh a i r a tis deep, or strong. If there is a disturbing factor present at\nthat moment then the h a i r a tis feeble. If a pilgrim experiences either\ns t rong or feeble h a i r a tbetween the third and fourth planes and is\nthen pushed forw a rd by accident to a higher plane, he invariably\ngoes to a position between the ﬁfth and sixth planes, again with the\nsame strong or feeble h a i r a t. However, such instances are very rare .\nAli Ahmed Sabir of Kalyar and Baba Abdur Rahman of Bombay\nboth were precipitated from a very strong hairat between the third\nand fourth planes into a very strong h a i r a tbetween the fifth and\nsixth planes, the former by a gift of grace from a Q u t u band the\nlatter through God’s gift in the shape of an accident.\nA complete ﬁxity of posture that lasts until death, or until a Per-\nfect Master is contacted, is seen only in those pilgrims who have\na v e ry strong h a i r a t. A mast ( G o d-intoxicated) who has been with\nMeher Baba for many years was in this m u q a m - e - h a i r a tbetween the\nt h i rd and fourth planes when he was brought to Meher Baba in\nRahuri in 1 9 3 6; but his h a i r a twas feeble, and although he would\nstand for many hours at a stretch in one position, this position would\nnot be maintained per m a n e n t l y. The enchantment of Ali Ahmed\nS a b i r, however, was a strong one, and he remained in one posture\nuntil he was ﬁnally delivered from the enchantment by a Q u t u b.\nThis state of enchantment should on no account be confused\nwith the catatonic stupor of a schizophrenic, although it may appear\ns i m i l a r. Both are states of enchantment, but they are poles apart. \n7",

In fact so far as divine presence on the ﬁfth plane\nis concerned, God is always present, but the pilgrim may not al-\nways desire this presence when he turns his attention to worldly\nduties.

It then exists as God’s shadow , which means that\nGod is both in the stage of Knowledge and ignorance. The follow-\ning four angles of the one experience, written in the language of\nS u ﬁgnosis, are diff e rent aspects of gnosis of souls in the sixth plane\nwhen they are face to face with God, but still in the domain of du-\na l i t y. All of these aspects are experienced together at the same time.\n1. Hama ust This means ‘Everything is He’; and for one\nwho experiences this gnosis, only God exists.\n2. Hama az ust This means ‘Everything is from Him’; and for\none who experiences this gnosis, all phenom-\nena, diversities and manyness exist as illusion\nwhen ignorance prevails.\n3.

His attributes\na re unlimited when Knowledge prevails, and\nlimited when ignorance prevails. Body , mind\nand the three worlds do not exist; but if they\nseem to exist, they exist as shadows.\n4. Hama dar ust This means ‘Everything is in Him’; and for one\nexperiencing this gnosis, even ignorance has no\nreality in itself. Its existence, when expre s s e d ,\n208 God Speaks Supplement\ncomes out of God’s unconscious and inﬁ n i t e\nKnowledge; and so whatever exists in duality\ndue to ignorance has come out of God where it\neverlastingly existed.”\n10 The Seventh Plane (52)\nIt should be understood that at the moment of being mer g e d\ninto the seventh plane, all links with the gross, subtle and mental\nbodies and with the universe are necessarily snapped. In ordinary\ng ross existence there is no parallel to this snapping of these long-\nenduring vital connections that bind the individual to his thr e e\nb o dies and to the universe. Physical death is, by comparison, an in-\ns i g n i ﬁcant thing, about as signiﬁcant as the snapping of a piece of\nstring. Ordinarily at the instant of death the subtle body and vital\nf o rce are separated completely from the gross body . But the mind\nmaintains the connection with the gross body for the ﬁrst four days\nafter death and, to a slighter degree, for seven days more after that.\nIn the ﬁnal annihilation ( f a n a), h o w e v e r, the separation is not be-\ntween body and mind; it is the actual annihilation of mind and of all\nn u q u s h-e-a m a l ( s a n s k a r a s ).\n11",

    "text": "Different Types of Miracles (67)\nMeher Baba has given us an explanation of the dif f e rence be-\ntween the miracles of:\n1. A Saviour (Avatar)\n2. A Perfect Master (Sadguru)\n3. A pir and a wali (i.e., one on the 6th or 5th plane, \nrespectively)\n4. Those on the lower planes ( i.e., 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th)\nIn connection with these four types Meher Baba tells us:\n1. The miracles of a Saviour a re of a universal character and are\np e rf o rmed when universally necessary . When a Saviour intends\nworking a miracle, he stations himself for the time being on the\n6th, 5th or 4th plane, as demanded by circumstances. When,\nhowever, it is desired that the miracles be very forceful, he sta-\ntions himself for the time being on the 4th plane.\n2. The miracles of a Perfect Master are on a very large scale, but\nthey do not cover the whole universe. Like the Saviour’s mir-\nacles, however, they are wrought solely for the spiritual awak-\nening of others. Like the Saviour also, the Perfect Master who\nintends working a miracle stations himself on the 6th, 5th or\n4th plane for the time being; and for a very forceful miracle, he\nstations himself for the time being on the 4th plane. No mir-\nacles are ever wrought by the M a j z o o b - e-K a m i lof the 7th plane\nfor the simple reason that the three spheres, the mental, subtle\nand gross, do not exist for such a soul.\n3. The miracles of a pir or w a l ia re on a limited scale. In fact they\np e rf o rm no miracles dire c t l y. However, such miracles as can be\nattributed to them are wrought from their mental inﬂuence over\nthe thoughts and feelings of others, yielding both spiritual and\nmaterial beneﬁts. They do not come down to the 4th plane—t h e\nplane of almighty spiritual powers.\n4. Pilgrims of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd planes can use or demon-\nstrate powers from their own plane, such as reading the minds\nof others, p roducing things from nowhere, reciting words or pas-\nsages from a book without seeing it, stopping trains, allowing\nthemselves to be buried alive for hours together, levitation, etc.,\netc. These are actual powers acquired by the pilgrim on the dif-\nf e rent planes and, as such, cannot be called mere jugglery . Per-\nfect Masters and the Avatar can snatch away a pilgrim’s ability\nto use the powers from the lower planes, viz., 1st, 2nd and 3rd ,\nand can even snatch away the almighty powers of one on the 4t h\nplane. Such a snatching away of powers of those on the lower\nplanes is known to the Suﬁs as s a l b-e-w i l a y a t .\nOn the fourth plane are stored all the almighty powers* w h i c h ,\nif misused by the pilgrim, result in his utter ruin. But such miracles\ndo not affect the world adversely, because the Qutub-e-Irshad—the\n11  Different T ypes of Miracles 209\n* One on the fourth plane is known as a mahayogi (a great yogi).\nhead of the spiritual hierarchy of the age—takes care to make these\nactions ineffective.\nMeher Baba further explains that the indiscriminate display of\npowers by a pilgrim of the ﬁrst three planes is fraught with serious\ndangers, but that one who misuses the powers of the fourth plane in-\nvariably falls back to the lowest phase of evolution—the stone state.\nKabir has referred to these dangers when he says:\nSaheba ka ghara dura hai jaisi lambi khajura\nCarhe so cakhe prema-rasa gire cakanacur .\n“The Lord ’s house is high, like the top of the tallest date palm.\nIf he climbs it, he tastes the nectar of love; if he falls, he\nbreaks his neck.”\nConscious and Unconscious Occurrence of Miracles\nThe miracles wrought by Saviours and Perfect Masters have a di-\nvine motive behind them and may be either voluntary or involun-\nt a ry . The voluntary miracles of a Saviour or Perfect Master are those\nthat he deliberately perf o rms by the expression and force of his w i l l ,\nand the involuntary ones are those that occur independently of the\nwill of the Saviour or Perfect Master and are wrought by means of\nthe ever-active force that surrounds these great beings. In the latter\ntype of miracle the Saviour or Perfect Master is unaware of the in-\ncidents of the miracle of which he himself is the source and prime\ncause. Both voluntary and involuntary miracles of these Per f e c t\nOnes are nevertheless always directed towards the spiritual awak-\nening of the world.\nWhy Do Saviours and Perfect Masters Perform Miracles?\nVe ry worldly people are spiritually obtuse, and they sometimes\nneed miracles to save themselves or other quite innocent people\nfrom the results of this insensitivity. The following analogy shows\nwhat is meant thereby .\nLet us suppose that a child is holding a sparrow in his hand and\nin so careless a way that he is on the point of strangling it. In order\nto save the sparro w ’s life it would be inadvisable to try to snatch the\n210 God Speaks Supplement\n11  Different T ypes of Miracles 211\nb i rd from the child’s hand, for the child would probably tighten\nhis grip on the sparrow and so kill it. But if the child is o ff e re d\na coin, he will almost certainly relax his hold on the sparrow and\nso release it. The child is thus prevented from killing the bird out\nof sheer ignorance of what he is doing. The miracles of a Per f e c t\nMaster accomplish the same sort of thing; they prevent people\nf rom doing themselves and others harm out of sheer ignorance\nof spiritual values. \nIf gold is deﬁned to r e p resent miracles, a yogi of the lower\nplanes dazzles worldly people by dangling this gold in front of\ntheir eyes so that they are astounded by his prowess. Should they\ns u rrender themselves to such a yogi they will ultimately suffer a\nc ruel disillusionment. But when the Saviour or a Perfect Master\ndangles this gold in front of the eyes of worldly people, he uses one\nf o rm of M a y ato drag them away from other and more binding\nf o rms of M a y a ,and so draws them towards the Path that leads to\ntheir true destiny , Self-realization.\nLet us take another illustration and imagine a man withm o n o-\nc h romatic vision to whom the world appears blue for example. His\neyes thus act like blue spectacles so that when he looks thr o u g h\nthem everything seems to be blue. Spiritually speaking the world\nis illusion and so has no colour at all. It is colourless. A yogi demon-\nstrating his miraculous powers merely replaces this man’s blue\n“spectacles” by green or red ones so that he sees everything as gre e n\nor red. To his ignorant eyes, accustomed to seeing the world blue,\nthis sudden change to green or red is astounding, and re ﬂects gre a t\na p p a rent credit on the yogi.\nA Perfect Master, knowing that neither blue nor red nor gre e n\nis the true colour, but that everything is colourless (i . e . ,n o t h i n g ) ,\nwastes no time in changing “spectacles,” thereby enabling the man\nto see the world as it really is: colourless, or nothing. The yogi and\nthose lesser masters who are not perfect merely replace one illusion\nby another. But a Perfect Master permanently tears away the veil of\na l lillusion and reveals the truth that Creation is imaginary and that\nGod alone is real. This working of the Perfect Master is a slow and\npainful process that lacks the colourfulness of the yogi’s spectacul a r\nand misleading method, and it is for this reason that the working\nof the Perfect Masters is unfathomable.\nWho Owns the Powers by Which Miracles Are Wrought?\nThe miraculous powers of a Perfect Master appear the same\nas those of a yogi of the fourth plane, but there is this important dif-\nf e rence, that the powers of a Perfect Master are his own, because he\nis Power itself. He has simply to will a thing and it is done. “Be and\nit was” (Kun faya kun )refers, according to the Suﬁs, to the divine\nmanifestation of power.\nThe yogis’ powers, however, are not their own and they have\nto depend on extraneous sources of power for working miracles.\nThe inherent powers of Perfect Masters are continually overﬂo w i n g ,\nand yogis and pilgrims of the lower planes borrow these overﬂo w-\ning powers and work miracles with them.This is quite in conso-\nnance with the Suﬁ belief that walis are the Prophet Muhammad’s\nwitnesses, and that all their miracles, like drops oozing from a skin\nﬁlled with honey , are derived from him. Endorsed by orthodox Mus-\nlims, this belief is limited in scope however, because it is applied\nonly to the personality of the Prophet Muhammad. Its universal ap-\nplicability is at once suggested though by the Suﬁ belief that fro m\nthe beginning there has been only o n eR a s o o lwho appears fro m\ntime to time in diff e rent countries under diff e rent names.\nIlluminating this point still furt h e r, Meher Baba has explained,\n“In f a n a-ﬁl l a h(the M a j z o o bstate) there are no miracles, direct or\ni n d i rect. In Divine Junction (turiya avasthaor m u q a m-e-f u ru t a t )t h e\nJ i v a n m u k t a ( A z a d-e-M u t l a q )has no duty and perf o rms no miracles.\nBut there is always a possibility of miracles happening through the\nJ i v a n m u k t awithout his being aware of it. The agents or pilgrims of\nthe lower planes very often borrow his powers and work miracles\nwith them, but the powers of the J i v a n m u k t aa re not in any way\nlessened thereby .”\nMiracles of the Saviour (Rasool or Avatar) \nand Perfect Masters (Sadgurus)\nWhen God becomes man, He becomes a Saviour ( R a s o o lo r\nAvatar) and when man becomes God, he becomes a Majzoob, and,\n212 God Speaks Supplement\n11  Different T ypes of Miracles 213\nif he has duty to perform to humanity, he traverses the second and\nt h i rd divine journeys and becomes a Perfect Master ( S a d g u ru ) .B o t h\nthe Saviour and the Perfect Master are spiritually perfect, because\nboth are one with God, and although both have a duty towards hu-\nmanity , that of the Saviour is of a special kind.\nThe Suﬁs say that the “relationship” ( q u r b a t )with God differs in\nthe Saviour and the Perfect Master, and they refer to them as q u r b -\ne - f a r a y i z( i n v o l u n t a ry necessary nearness) and q u r b-e-n a w a f i l\n( v o lu n t a ry nearness) re s p e c t i v e l y. Q u r b-e-f a r a y i zthus belongs to the\nSaviours and q u r b-e-n a w a ﬁl to the Perfect Masters.\nThe Suﬁs explain that in the working of miracles by the R a s o o l\n(the Av a t a r), God is the actor and man the instrument; while in a\nP e rfect Master it is the other way round—man is the actor and God\nthe instrument. The famous incident of the Prophet Muhammad\nt h rowing a handful of dust at the enemy in the battle of Badr and\nt h e reby routing them is an example of a Saviour working a mira c l e .\nAlthough to all appearances it was Muhammad as a man who\nthrew the dust, in reality it was God as Muhammad who threw the\ndust, and Muhammad as a man who routed the enemy . A miracle\nsuch as this is therefore an illustration of qurb-e-farayiz.\nThe miracles perf o rmed by Perfect Masters are, however, illus-\ntrations of q u r b-e-n a w a ﬁl ,of which the miracle of Shamsi Ta b r i z —\nthat of raising the dead to life—is a good example. When Shams\nu t t e red the words “Qum bi ixn i l l a h ”(arise in the name of God) the\nprince did not come to life; but when he said“Qum bi ixni” (arise in\nmy name) the prince at once came to life. Here Shamsi Tabriz as\nman gave the ord e r, and God as Shamsi Tabriz clothed himself with\nthe attribute of Himself—in this case with the attribute of life—and\nso re s t o red the prince to life. In q u r b-e-n a w a ﬁl man is the actor and\nGod the instru m e n t .\nLet us for a moment discuss the diff e rence in the attitude of East\nand West towards miracles. The East, which possesses a long re c o rd\nof familiarity with Perfect Masters and advanced souls, has come to\naccept that God, because He is inﬁnite, cannot be comprehended by\nthe ﬁnite mind. The East knows that human intellect, which is lim-\nited in scope, has its use only up to a certain stage in tackling meta-\nphysical problems. As sung by the philosopher Dr. Iqbal:\n’Aql go astaj se dur nahij\nUski taqdir maij huyur nahij\n“Intellect, though not far away from the threshold (of the\nBeloved) is not destined to enjoy the Divine Presence.”\nThe East thus knows that at the point where intellect gives up\nits eff o rts in grappling with that which is transcendental, love must\ntake up the link. The West sets great store by the intellectual ap-\np roach, and that which refuses to come within the orbit of intellect\nis apt to be either denied or scoffed at. As a by-p roduct of this oc-\ncidental attitude we may cite the utter misuse of the word “mystic”\nin current American idiom. The ardent religious enthusiasm of\nmedieval Europe has been almost replaced by great enthusiasm for\nculture and science.\nThe doctrines of science are, however, ﬂuid to a certain extent,\nand the genuine scientist does look facts in the face, but Meher Baba\nhas often declared that in spite of its great pro g ress science is yet far\nf rom the core of material things, and further from the outer m o s t\nfringe of spiritual things. The heart must cooperate with the head.\nIt may be that some of the purely physical feats of yogis, which\npass for miracles with the multitude, can be explained away by\nmedical science. But real miracles, particularly the miracles of\nP e rfect Masters, do not admit of scientiﬁc explanation. Many of the\nmiracles wrought by Saviours, Perfect Masters and saints are re-\nc o rded in the spiritual legends and classics of all peoples and all re l i-\ngions, and the ever-functioning spiritual hierarchy is daily adding\nto these miracles. The facts are there; Jesus and other Perfect O n e s\nhave raised the dead to life, and have healed diseases. But even if\none were to see a miracle take place before one’s very eyes, and even\nif one were convinced that it was a miracle and not trickery , one\nwould never be able to formulate a rational explanation of it, for\nmiracles are utterly beyond the reach of intellectual explanation.\nThey are a mystery as deep as life itself.\nP e rhaps, however, the fault is not entirely without reason, for\nthe world at large seldom gets an insight into the workings of Per-\nfect Masters, and, in truth, most of these workings lie tr e a s u re d\nin the breasts of a few intimate associates and deserving initiates,\n214 God Speaks Supplement\n12",

In the words of the famous\nSuﬁ Abdul Hasan Kharqani, “If a few drops of that which is under\nthe skin of a Perfect Master should come forth between his lips, all\nthe creatures of heaven and earth would fall into panic.”\nIn spite of the mass appeal of miracles and of the claims of spiri-\ntual masters, the East, like the West, is also very circumspect in its\nattitude towards them. It may be said to its credit, however, that the\nEast has learned by long experience not to deny the actions of the\nspiritual hierarc h y, even if it cannot see its way to accept or believe\nin them. One of the earliest Suﬁs has declared, “Miracles are only\none of the thousand stages on the way to God”; and the Av a t a ro f\nthis cycle, Meher Baba, afﬁrms that the greatest miracle a Per f e c t\nMaster can perf o rm is to make another man spiritually perfect like\nhimself.\n12 Kinds of Powers (67)\nSpirituality and spiritualism are two diff e rent things. Spiritual-\nity has nothing to do with any kind of power in any form. Spiri-\ntuality is the path of love for God and obedience and surrender to\nthe Perfect Master.\nAs one travels the Path, one comes across powers on the planes\nof consciousness. Those on the planes from ﬁrst to fourth are some-\ntimes tempted to demonstrate these powers.\nThere are three kinds of powers:\n1. The divine powers of the fourth plane.\n2. The occult powers of the ﬁrst three planes of \nconsciousness. These are called the mystic powers.\n3. Other occult powers. \n1. The divine powersof the fourth plane are the almighty powe r s\nof God. They are the source of all powers, whether mystic or\nother occult powers.\nThe mystic and other occult powers are inﬁnitely insigniﬁ-\ncant in comparison with the divine powers.\nThe divine powers remain always the same because God is\nalways One and the same. The occult powers, whether they are\nof the planes or not, are diff e rent in kind and vary in expre s s i o n .\nThe miracles perf o rmed through the manifestation of the\ndivine powers by the Avatar and the Qutub a re called m o j e z a t .\nThese are per f o rmed for the good of all—on a limited scale\nby the Qutub and on a universal scale by the Av a t a r. H o w e v e r,\nthese can be performed for any individual in close association\nwith the Avatar or the Qutub.\nThe miracles per f o rmed indirectly by those on the fifth\nand sixth planes with the help of the divine powers are called\nk a r a m a a t .\nThe display of the mystic powers by those on the ﬁrst up\nt h rough the third plane cannot in fact be termed miracles. Such\na display is nothing but a show of powers that they come acro s s\nwhile traversing the planes; such a display of powers is called\nshobada.\nWhen the one on the fourth plane makes good use of the\ndivine powers and per f o rms a miracle, it can be termed as\nkaramat-e-mojeza; when he makes a bad use of them, i.e., mis-\nuses the divine powers of the fourth plane, it is termed m o j e z a -\ne-shobada.\nThe fourth plane is re g a rded as the “threshold” of the men-\ntal sphere, and so the misuse of the divine powers on the fourt h\nplane results in a “fall” as far back as the stone state and re s u l t s\nin disintegration of consciousness.\n2 . The occult powers of the ﬁrst three planes, called the mystic\npowers, cannot be misused by the aspirant on these planes,\nthough they sometimes are tempted to display them. These mys-\ntic powers are diff e rent and vary in expression, such as: re a d-\ning the minds of others; reciting words or passages from a book\nwithout seeing it; allowing themselves to be buried alive for\nhours together, etc.\nThe powers of the planes are not induced. These powers\na re ever accessible to those on the planes, within their own\nl i mited environment, and as such need no concentrated effort\nto display them. This display of powers should not be confused\nwith the demonstrations of mind readers and of others who put\non stage performances.\n216 God Speaks Supplement\n12  Kinds of Powers 217\nThe one on the third plane of consciousness can raise dead\nsub-human creatures but can never make a dead human being\nalive. This he can do because of the nearness to and “warmth”\nof the divine powers of the fourth plane.\nBut one on the fourth plane can raise the dead including\nhuman beings by the use of the divine powers of the four t h\nplane.\nThe one on the third plane can change his physical form\nat will, and one who does this is known as abdal. This act is\nalso a display of the mystic powers, but not the misuse of pow-\ners. However, this act should not be confused with the dema-\nterialization or materialization of the human forms by the\ntantriks.\n3. Other occult powers have nothing to do with spirituality or\nwith the mystic powers of the planes.\nThese occult powers are of two types:\na. Superior occult powers.\nb. Inferior occult powers.\nThe one who has these occult powers can make good or bad\nuse of the same. Good use of occult powers helps one to put\nhimself on the planes of the Path and may even make one a m a-\nhayogi. Bad use of these occult powers makes one suffer in-\ntensely in the next human form. Good use of superior occult\npowers puts one on the ﬁfth plane of consciousness after four\nlives (reincarnations).\na . Superior types of occult powers are derived from t a n t r i k\ne x e rcises such as c h i l l a-nashini or repetition of cer t a i n\nmantras, e t c .\nThe one who holds these powers can per f o rm the so-\ncalled miracles such as levitation, ﬂying and ﬂoating in the\nair, dematerialization and materialization, etc.\nb. Inferior types of occult powers need no tantrik or any spe-\ncial exercises. They are had through sanskaras of past lives.\nFor example: if someone has done certain good deeds many\ntimes in the past, his next incarnation may give him the\n218 God Speaks Supplement\nf a culty of inferior occult powers without undergoing any\ns t renuous exercises. His sanskaras give him the faculty\nof inferior occult powers such as clairvoyance, clairaudi-\nence, healing, producing sweets or money seemingly out\nof nothing, etc.\nAll such capabilities form part of the lower or inferior\ntype of occult powers.\nIf one makes good use of the inferior type of occult pow-\ners, he derives superior type of occult powers in his next life\nwithout undergoing any tantrik e x e rcises. Likewise, the one\nwho puts to good use his faculty of hypnotism gains the su-\nperior type of occult powers in his next life.\n13",

To gain full consciousness, it\ngets increasing s a n s k a r a sin the process of evolution, till in the human\nf o rm, it gets full consciousness as well as all the gross s a n s k a r a s.\nIn the process of r e i n c a rnation, this soul retains its full con-\nsciousness and exchanges ( i . e., a l t e rnatingly experiences) the di-\nverse s a n s k a r a sin itself; and in the process of realization, this soul\nretains its full consciousness, but its s a n s k a r a sbecome fainter and\nfainter till they all disappear and only consciousness remains. While\nbecoming faint, gross s a n s k a r a sbecome subtle s a n s k a r a s ,s u b t l e\ns a n s k a r a sbecome mental s a n s k a r a s ;and ﬁnally they all disappear.\nUp to the human form, the winding process of s a n s k a r a sb e-\ncomes stronger and stronger in the process of evolution. In the hu-\nman form, in the process of re i n c a rnation, the winding retains its\nfull strength; but in the process of realization, the s a n s k a r a sg r a d u-\nally unwind themselves, till in the God-state, they are completely\nunwound.\nGod, the Over-Soul, alone is real. Nothing exists but God. The\nd i ff e rent souls are in the Over-Soul and one with it. The pro c e s s e s\nof evolution, re i n c a rnation and realization are all necessary in ord e r\nto enable the soul to gain self-consciousness. In the process of wind-\ning, s a n s k a r a sbecome instrumental for the evolution of conscious-\nness though they also give sanskaric bindings; and in the pro c e s s\nof unwinding, sanskaric attachments are annihilated, though the\nconsciousness which has been gained is fully re t a i n e d .\nIn the process of the winding of s a n s k a r a s ,the soul goes thro u g h\nseven stages of descent; and in the process of unwinding, the soul\ngoes through seven stages of ascent. But the phenomena of descent\nas well as ascent are both illusory . The soul is every w h e re and indi-\nvisibly inﬁnite; and it does not move or descend or ascend.\n* See chart IX. “A” soul becomes “Z” soul. \nThe souls of all men and women, of all nationalities, castes and\nc reeds, are really one; and their experiences of good and evil, of\nﬁghting and helping, of waging wars and living in peace are all a\np a rt of illusion and delusion, because all these experiences are\ngained through bodies and minds, which in themselves are nothing.\nB e f o re the world of forms and duality came into existence,\nt h e re was nothing but God, i . e ., an indivisible and boundless ocean\nof Power, Knowledge and Bliss. But this ocean was unconscious\nof itself. Picture to yourself this ocean as absolutely still and calm,\nunconscious of its Power, Knowledge and Bliss and unconscious\nthat it is the ocean. The billions of drops which are in the ocean do\nnot have any consciousness; they do not know that they are drops\nnor that they are in the ocean nor that they are a part of the ocean.\nThis represents the original state of Reality .\nThis original state of Reality comes to be disturbed by an urge\nto know itself. This urge was always latent in the ocean; and when\nit begins to express itself, it endows the drops with individuality .\nWhen this urge makes the still water move, there immediately\nspring up numerous bubbles or forms around the drops; and it is\nthese bubbles which give individuality to the drops. The bubbles\ndo not and cannot actually divide the indivisible ocean; they can-\nnot separate the drop from the ocean; they merely give to these\ndrops a feeling of separateness or limited individuality .\nNow let us study the life of one dr o p-soul through its dif f e r-\nent stages. Owing to the arising of the bubble, the drop-soul which\nwas completely unconscious is invested with individuality (or a\nfeeling of separateness) as well as with very slight consciousness.\nThis consciousness, which has sprung up in the dro p-soul, is not\nof itself nor of the ocean; but it is of the bubble or the form, which\nin itself is nothing. This imperfect bubble at this stage is r e p re-\nsented by the f o rm of a stone. After some time, this bubble or form\nbursts and there springs up in its place another bubble or for m .\nNow, when a bubble bursts, two things happen: (1) there is an in-\nc rease in consciousness and (2) t h e re is a twist or consolidation\nof impressions or s a n s k a r a saccumulated during the life of the pre-\nvious bubble. The consciousness of the dro p-soul has now slightly\n14  The Divine Theme 221\ni n c reased; but the dr o p-soul is still conscious only of this new\nbubble or form and not of itself nor of the ocean. This new bubble\nis re p resented by the form of the metal. This new bubble or form\nalso bursts in due course of time; and simultaneously there is a\nf u rther increase in consciousness and a fresh twist or consolidation\nof s a n s k a r a s ,which gives rise to the emergence of another type of\nbubble or form.\nThis process continues right through the course of evolution,\nwhich covers the stages of stones, metals, vegetables, worms, ﬁs h e s ,\nb i rds and animals. Every time that the previous bubble or f o rm\nbursts, it gains more consciousness and adds one twist to the al-\nready accumulated s a n s k a r a s ,until it reaches the human bubble or\nf o rm, in which the ever-i n c reasing consciousness becomes full and\ncomplete. The process of the winding up of s a n s k a r a sconsists of\nthese regular twists; and it is these twists which keep the con-\nsciousness, gained by the dro p-soul, directed and ﬁxed towards the\nbubble or the form instead of towards its real Self, even when con-\nsciousness is fully developed in the human form.\nOn gaining the human form, the second process begins; this\np rocess is that of r e i n c a rnation. At this point, the process of the\nwinding up of s a n s k a r a scomes to an end. The dro p-soul takes nu-\nm e rous human forms one by one; and these forms are exactly\ne i g h t y-four l a k h sin number. These human forms are sometimes\nthose of man and sometimes those of woman; and they change na-\ntionalities, appearance, colour and creed. The dr o p-soul thro u g h\nhuman incarnations experiences itself sometimes as a beggar and\nsometimes as a king, and thus gathers experiences of the oppo-\nsites of happiness or misery according to its good or bad s a n-\ns k a r a s. In re i n c a rnation (i . e . ,in its successive and several human\nf o rms) the dro p-soul retains its full consciousness but continues\nto have alternating experiences of opposite s a n s k a r a s, till the\np rocess of realization begins. And during this process of r e a l i z a-\ntion the s a n s k a r a sget unwound. In r e i n c a rnations, there is a\nspending up of s a n s k a r a s ;but this spending up is quite dif f e re n t\nf rom the unwinding of the s a n s k a r a s ,which takes place during the\np rocess of realization. The spending up of s a n s k a r a sitself cre a t e s\n222 God Speaks Supplement\nnew s a ns k a r a s ,which bind the soul; but the unwinding of s a n s k a r a s\ndoes not itself create fresh s a n s k a r a s ;and it is intended to undo the\nv e ry strong grip of s a n s k a r a s ,in which the dro p-soul is caught.\nUp to the human form, the winding up of s a n s k a r a sb e c o m e s\ns t ronger and stronger during the process of evolution. In the human\nforms of reincarnation, the winding continues to operate as a lim-\niting factor; but with every change of the human bubble or for m ,\nthe tight twists, gained during the process of winding, get loosened\nt h rough eighty-four l a k h sof shakings,* b e f o re they are ready to un-\nwind in the process of realization.\nNow begins the third process of realization, which is aprocess\nof ascent. Here, the dro p-soul undergoes the gradual unwinding of\nthe s a n s k a r a s. During this process of unwinding, the s a n s k a r a sb e-\ncome fainter and fainter; and at the same time, the consciousness\nof the dro p-soul gets directed more and more towards itself; and\nthus, the dro p-soul passes through the subtle and mental planes till\nall the sanskaras disappear completely, enabling it to become con-\nscious of itself as the ocean.\nIn the inﬁnite ocean of the Over-Soul, you are the drop or the\nsoul. You are the soul in the ord i n a ry state; and you use your con-\nsciousness in seeing and experiencing the bubble or the for m .\nT h rough the gross layer of the bubble, you experience that part of\nthe huge gross bubble which is the earth. You are eternally lodged\nand indivisibly one with the Over-Soul; but you do not experience\nit. In the advanced stage, up through the third plane, you use your\nconsciousness in seeing and experiencing the huge subtle bubble\ncalled the subtle world, through the subtle bubble or form called\n14  The Divine Theme 223\n* [Many readers do not discern that Meher Baba customarily described the life cycle\nas: evolution, reincarnation, involution and the process of realization.\nFearing the statement in the text above might seem contradictory to that in para-\ngraph 3, page 176, we asked Eruch B. Jessawala for clariﬁcation.\nHe replied: “Once one is on the planes of consciousness, the reincarnation process\nmay be said to have come to its fag end. On the Path leading to Beloved God, the\nimpatience to ‘see’ Him and to be One with Him is intense. Such r e i n c a rn a t i o n s\nas are necessary, due to impressions burdening the consciousness, seem almost\nnil when compared to eighty-four lakhs of shakings.” Ed.]\n224 God Speaks Supplement\nthe subtle body; but you do not see and experience the Over-S o u l\nwhich you are in, since your consciousness is not now directed to-\nw a rds the Over-Soul. In the advanced stage from the f o u rt h\nt h rough the sixth plane, you use your consciousness in see i n g\nand experiencing the huge mental bubble, which is called the men-\ntal world, through the mental bubble or form which is called the\nmental body , but even now you do not experience the Over-S o u l .\nBut in the God-realized state, you continually use your conscious-\nness for seeing and experiencing the Over-Soul; and then all the\nforms are known as being nothing but bubbles.\nSo, now , picture yourself as the soul-d rop, lodged in the Over-\nSoul, behind ﬁve layers after the gross body . You, the soul-drop, are\nnow looking at the gross body and through it at the gross world.\nWhen you look at the second layer and through it, the first layer\nwill appear to you as nothing but a layer only , and thus, looking\nb ehind each layer, you will find all these layers as only your\nshadow covers; and ﬁn a l l y, when you (i . e . ,the soul-d rop) look at\nand get merged in the Over-Soul, you realize that only you were\nreal and all that you were seeing and experiencing till now was\nyour own shadow and nothing else.\nExplanation of Charts IX and X\nChart IX\nThe big semi-c i rcle in Chart IX re p resents the Over-Soul, which\ncontains everything in the universe. The life of a single individ-\nual soul is depicted in the three main stages of evolution, re i n c a r-\nnation and the process of realization. “S” stands for the individual\nsoul. Before attaining the human form, it goes through seven stages\nof each of the following kinds of existence, viz., stone, metal, vege-\ntable, worm, ﬁsh, bird and animal. At the seventh stage, i . e . ,just be-\nf o re entering a new kind of existence, you will note a pictorial\nre p resentation of a twist or a knot, which stands for a consolidation\nof previously acquired s a n s k a r a s. The outer red circle round the i n-\ndividual soul “S,” re p resents the s a n s k a r a saccumulated during the\nprocess of evolution; and the blue appendage to “S” represents the\n\n14  The Divine Theme 225\nconsciousness, which comes to be developed simultaneously . “ A ”\nsoul becomes “Z” soul after going through evolution, re i n c a rn a t i o n\nand the process of realization. It is only in the God state that con-\nsciousness is free from sanskaras.\nThe gross, subtle and mental worlds ( i . e . ,anna bhumi, pran\nbhumi and mano bhumi) are each represented by a big circle on the\nr i g h t-hand side. Since consciousness of the gross world is not fully\ndeveloped in the pre-human stages of evolution, the lines which\nconnect the stone, metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird and animal\nsouls, through their respective stone, metal, vegetable, worm, ﬁs h ,\nb i rd and animal forms, are shown merely as touching the gr o s s\nworld only partially; while, since consciousness is fully developed\nin the human form, it is shown (through corresponding lines) as\nbeing capable of understanding the entire gross world in all its dif-\nferent aspects.\nIn the process of re i n c a rnations, the soul may take a male or a\nfemale form; and it may belong to any nationality , creed or re l i g i o n .\nF rom the point of view of self-knowledge, the process up to the at-\ntainment of the human forms re p resents an actual descent, though\nit looks like an ascent; and the process of realization r e p re s e n t s\nan actual ascent, though it looks like a descent; and these two\np rocesses are respectively re p resented by a line (re p resenting de-\nscent) of winding knots of s a n s k a r a s ,which goes u pf rom the\nstone stage to the gross world, and by a line (representing ascent)\nof unwinding knots of s a n s k a r a s ,which comes d o w nf rom the\ng ross world to the God state. The process of or d i n a ry re i n c a rn a-\ntions begins after the winding is complete; and it continues till the\nunwinding has begun.\nIn the process of realization, advanced souls from the first\nt h rough the third planes are conscious only of the subtle world,\nthrough their subtle bodies. They are aware of ordinary souls who\na re gross-conscious and can act upon them in the subtle world; but\nall this is done by them through the subtle body and in the subtle\nworld; and they have no connection with the gross world through\nthe gross body. In the same way , advanced souls from the fourt h\nt h rough the sixth planes are aware of gross-conscious as well as\nsubtle-conscious souls; but they act upon them in the mental world\nt h rough the mental body; and they have no connection with the\ng ross world through the gross body, nor with the subtle world\nt h rough the subtle body . There f o re, the lines in the chart connect\nthe subtle-conscious souls only with the subtle world; and the cor-\nresponding lines connect the mental-conscious souls only with the\nmental world.\nIn the God state, in which all the sanskaras are unwound, con-\nsciousness is turned only to God; this is the state of M a j z o o b s - e -\nK a m i l ,who have no connection with the gross nor the subtle nor\nthe mental worlds. But a few who enjoy the God-state also come\ndown and regain the consciousness of the entire Creation. These\nare the souls of the Masters. The soul of the Master is represented\nby seven concentric coloured rings.* The following points (which\nhave been brought out by connecting lines) should be car e f u l l y\nnoted: (i) The Master’s soul is connected with God Beyond, which\nis the vidnyan or the resting place of the Masters, (ii) it is connected\nwith the God state and (iii) it is not only connected with all the\nt h ree worlds, but all the souls, whether they are mental-c o n s c i o u s ,\ns u b t l e-conscious or re i n c a rnating human beings (who are gr o s s -\nconscious), or souls who are in the pre-human evolutionary stage.\nChart X\nChart X brings out the details pertaining to the process of evo-\nlution up to the human form and the process of realization up\nto the state of a God-realized being. The innermost small cir c l e\nwhich is referred to by “S” represents the individual soul. The soul\nis shown as having an increasing number of circles around itself\nup to the human stage; and it is shown as retaining all these circ l e s\nlater on.

Side by side with the development of the subtle body , there\nis a simultaneous development of instinct. Intellect, in its par t i a l\ndevelopment, makes its first appearance at the stage of animals;\nbut the mental body appears only at the last stage r e p resented by\nthe human form.\nIn the human form, the ﬁrst innermost circle re p resents the in-\nd i v i d u a lsoul; the next outer circle re p resents full consciousness;\nand then the other outer circles (in the order in which they are\ndrawn) respectively represent (i) the seat of individuality, (ii) san-\nskaras or unexpressed desires, (iii) intellect, (iv) felt desires of the\nmental body , (v) subtle body (in which there is a partial expre s s i o n\nof desires) and (vi) the gross body (in which the desires come to\nbe fully expre s s e d). All the circles round the innermost circle of the\nsoul, with the exception of the first circle of consciousness, are\nlayers of consciousness. Of these layers, the outermost circle and\nthe circle next to it respectively represent the gross and the subtle\nbodies, while the other four layers around consciousness re p re s e n t\nfour functions of one mental body . Of these four functions of the\nmental body , two (i . e . ,felt desires and intellect) are usually in-\ncluded under mind; and the other two ( i . e . , s a n s k a r a sor unex-\np ressed desires and the seat of individuality) are included under\nthe ego. Thus, at the human stage, the soul, with its consciousness,\nhas three bodies, but six layers (including the gross layer known\nas the gross body).\nWhen (after re i n c a rnations) the human soul launches upon the\np rocess of realization, intellect is replaced by inspiration, which\nﬁnds its expression from the ﬁrst to the third plane; and from the\nf o u rth to the sixth plane, this inspiration is transformed into illu-\nmination.\nThe coloured rings or concentric circles re p resent the soul of a\nG o d-realized person, with all the vehicles at its disposal. In re s p e c t\nto this diagram, the following points should be carefully noted:\n(i) The three outer rings respectively re p resent the gross, subtle and\nthe mental bodies. We ﬁnd all these bodies also in ord i n a ry human\nbeings. (ii) In the God-realized person, there has emerged a new\n14  The Divine Theme 227\nspiritual body , known as the universal body or mahakarana \nsharir ,which is the seat of the universal mind. Just as water is con-\ntained in a cup, the universal mind may be said to be contained\nin the universal body. Ther e f o re, though the universal body and\nthe universal mind are r e p resented by two dif f e rent circles, they\na re i nseparable from each other. (The universal mind of the Mas-\nt e r, which works through his universal body , is in direct contact\nwith the mental bodies of all the individual souls in Creation; and\nit can, through these mental bodies, bring about any changes in the\nmental, subtle or gross worlds. Though the Master has a mental\nbody like ord i n a ry humans, he always works only through his uni-\nversal mind.) (iii) In the Master’s soul, the limited ego of the\nhuman stage is transmuted into the unlimited Ego, i.e., the feel-\ning of separateness and narrow individuality is replaced by the re-\nalization of unlimited, indivisible and all-c o m p rehensive existence.\n(iv) The soul of the Master is endowed with inﬁnite consciousness.\nThe full consciousness at the human stage does not reveal or ex-\np ress the inﬁnity of the soul, owing to the limitations of s a n s k a r a s ;\nbut in the God-realized person, this full consciousness is not lim-\nited by any sanskaras and, therefore, it reveals or expresses the in-\nﬁnity of the soul.\n15",

    "text": "The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba (70)\nMeher Baba says there are five spheres: (1) g ross, (2) s u b t l e ,\n(3) mental, (4) composite and (5) Real. The ﬁrst four concern re l a-\ntive existences and the ﬁfth one is composed of the one and only\nReal Existence.\nThe question of details is all the more important when a subject\nis beyond ord i n a ry human experience. On the one hand, more de-\ntails confuse one more, and less details explain things less. This gives\nrise to a variety of terms and expressions for use from dif f e re n t\nv i e wpoints and in diff e rent contexts. In the absence of underlying\nexperience, descriptions of the same one thing often sound con-\nt r a d i c t o ry . But in the light of relative experiences or the ﬁnal re a l i-\nzation of Truth, the very contradictions prove to be complementary\n228 God Speaks Supplement\ne x p ressions about the same one Truth. The facts and the fact of facts\nunderlying the ﬁve spheres will bear this out.\nThe ﬁrst, the gross sphere, although entirely depending for its\nexistence on the subtle, is distinctly diff e rent in very many re s p e c t s\nf rom the subtle. The gross sphere consists of numberless worlds,\nsuns, moons, stars, and in fact everything material from the cru d e s t\nto the ﬁnest. Some of the worlds in the gross sphere contain min-\nerals and vegetation only; some others contain countless embodied\nbeings also, and in some there are included human beings. The\npoint of prime importance in the gross sphere is our world (Eart h ) .\nH e re, amongst all other beings who are conscious in greater or lesser\nd e g ree of the gross, man with his full consciousness is superior to\nall other beings of all gross worlds. * But until man h e re a w a k e n s\nto the subtle, his full consciousness remains fully occupied with the\ng ross, even when he reads and thinks of spiritual subjects such as\nthe one discussed here .\nThe second, the subtle sphere, is the sphere of energ y, and al-\nthough it is divided into seven divisions, it is one world by itself.\nIts subsistence depends upon the mental sphere but it exists en-\nti rely independent of the gross sphere. In the parlance of time and\nspace, the domain of the gross sphere, with its inﬁnite space com-\nprising universes of innumerable suns, planets and worlds, includ-\ning our Earth, is but a speck as compared with the subtle sphere .\nThe path of Self-realization, the r a h-e-t a r i q a tof the Suﬁs and\nthe adhyatmic marg aof the Vedantists, consisting of seven planes\n15  The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba 229\n* This means also superior spiritually amongst all human beings of the gross sphere .\nMeher Baba tells us that of the three worlds in the gross sphere which are inhabited\nby human beings, ours (the Earth) is the one where man is the highest spiritually.\nHe explains that, whereas man on this Earth possesses in his personality equal de-\ng rees of head and heart (5 0 %head and 50% h e a rt), man on the other two worlds\npossesses 100% head, and 75% head and 25% h e a rt, re s p e c t i v e l y. Man, in the course\nof his reincarnations, is born on any one of the three worlds, but must ﬁnally take\nf o rm and r e i n c a rnate on this Earth to fulfill his divine destiny which is God-\nrealization. In the gross sphere, the Earth is the last and nearest stepping stone to\nthe Path. The two other worlds are most close to the Earth in the pattern of habi-\ntation. Altogether there are 18,000 worlds with life, but these two worlds and the\nEarth are akin to one another in the pattern of human life. \n( m u q a m sor s t h a n s), is the one and only bridge between the first\ns p h e re of the gross and the ﬁfth, the Real sphere. The path has its\nﬁrst three planes in the subtle, the second sphere.\nThe subtle sphere through its energ y, its angels, and above all\nt h rough man’s partial and full subtle-consciousness (human con-\nsciousness partly or fully freed from the gross, in the gross), while\npenetrating the gross sphere itself, also penetrates infinite space\nwith its suns, stars, planets and, in fact, every thing and every being\nin all the worlds within the gross sphere.\nThe unlimited diversity and intensity of subtle sights, sounds,\nfeelings and powers have no parallel in the gross sphere, save energ y\nwhich becomes limited within the bounds of the gross, and human\nconsciousness which is surrounded by gross limitations.\nThe third, the mental sphere, is the sphere of the spheres. It is\nabsolutely independent of both the subtle and gross spheres and\nis independently sustained by Divinity . The mental sphere is the\nv e ry abode of Mind, individual, collective and universal. The Mind\np e rvades its own sphere as much as it does throughout the subtle\nand gross spheres.\nThis sphere of the Mind includes everything relating to intel-\nlect, intuition, insight and illumination. Herein are also contained\nthe loftier planes of the Path, the fifth and the sixth. The four t h\nplane is but a junction between the third plane in the subtle sphere\nand the ﬁfth plane in the mental sphere.\nN e v e rtheless, the mental sphere does not and cannot touch the\nReal Sphere, as nothing can touch it save its own Reality , conscious\nof itself in the eternal “I am God” state of God.\nThe fourth, the composite sphere, is the most named and the\nleast understood one. It is composed of twenty-one sub-spher e s\nand as such it is both a sphere and not a sphere by itself.\nThe twenty-one connecting links are made up of seven sub-gro s s\nand sub-subtle spheres between the gross and the subtle spher e s ;\nseven sub-subtle and sub-mental spheres between the subtle and the\nmental spheres; and seven sub-mental and sub-supramental sphere s\nbetween the mental sphere and the Real Sphere .\nThe peculiar nature and position of the composite spherec o u l d\nbe grasped more easily through either of the following tables:\n230 God Speaks Supplement\nT able I\n1. Gross\n7 (lower)\n2. Subtle\n4. Composite 7 (middle)\n3. Mental\n7 (higher)\n5. Real\nT able II\n1. The Gross Sphere (First Sphere)\nSeven lower sub-spheres\nof\n4. The Composite Sphere (Fourth Sphere).\n2. The Subtle Sphere (Second Sphere)\nSeven middle sub-spheres\nof\n4. The Composite Sphere (Fourth Sphere).\n3. The Mental Sphere (Third Sphere)\nSeven higher sub-spheres\nof\n4. The Composite Sphere (Fourth Sphere).\n5. The Real Sphere (Fifth Sphere).\nThe seven lower sub- s p h e res are spiritually superior to the\ng ross sphere and they do touch the gross, whereas the seven higher\ns u b-s p h e res are neither spiritually superior to the mental sphere\nnor can they ever touch the Real Sphere as will be clear from fur-\nther details which follow.\nOn the one hand, the all- i m p o rtant Path, the one and only\nbridge between man and God, runs through the two spheres of the\nsubtle and the mental, and on the other hand, there are innumer-\nable things and beings in these two spheres as well as in between\nthe seven lower and seven higher sub-s p h e res, and each one of the\nthings and beings is directly or indirectly vital to the Path.\n15  The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba 231\n{\n232 God Speaks Supplement\nF rom the seven lower to the seven middle sub-s p h e res, inclu-\nsive of the subtle sphere, amongst other things there are the abodes\nof the disembodied souls (spirits) and the un-embodied souls (an-\ngels). From the seven middle to the seven higher sub-spheres, in-\nclusive of the mental sphere, amongst other things there is the abode\nof the archangels.\nThe spirits (disembodied souls), both good and bad, have to re-\nmain in the “state of waiting,” both before and after experiencing\nthe states of pleasure and pain—states commonly known as heaven\nand hell.37\nT\nhe angels (unembodied souls) are mere automatons for the\nwill of God and they do nothing which is not desired or prompted\nby God. These wishes happen to be mere expressions of divine pow-\ner and activity which are all- p e rvading. In short, angels are pure\nand not contaminated with physical embodiment. In this they are\nsuperior to the man whose consciousness has not extended beyond\nthe limitations of the gross (meaning a man not yet on the Path).\nP a r a d o x i c a l l y, man, the inferior, who has succeeded in being con-\ntaminated with physical embodiment, is actually the superior in\nthe strength of the potentialities latent within him. Experiencing\nhis imperfections, limitations and weaknesses, he is potentially ripe\nto realize his real strength and purity which are far above those\nof, and beyond the reach of, even the archangels.\nThe archangels are the mediums for the expression of God’s\nprincipal divine attributes of creating, pr e s e rving and destro y i n g\nlimited life on an unlimited scale, and of communicating unlimited\nKnowledge on a limited scale. The archangels are entities who al-\nways enjoy and never suffer.\nThe abode of the archangels, the sub-supramental spheres of\nthe fourth, the composite sphere which is discussed here, comes\nafter the third—the mental sphere—and is nearest the fifth, the\nReal Sphere. This is true, yet not the whole truth; for in spite of its\nproximity it cannot touch the Real Sphere. An archangel, from the\nhighest sub-supramental sphere, can never see God, whereas man\nin the sixth plane of the third, the mental sphere, can and does\nsee God face to face every w h e re and in everything. The last point\nof the last of the sub-supramental spheres is what the Sufis call the\ns a d r a t-u l-m u n t a h a(the last limit), beyond which, as is popularly\nand rightly believed by the Muslims, even the archangel Gabriel\ncannot go.\nMan has and man shall (because man alone can) jump over the\nlast seven links of the really non-existent relative existences of all\nthe four spheres into his really own—the ﬁfth, the Real Sphere. In\nshort, angels must necessarily cease to be angels and become man\nb e f o re they can reach the Reality attainable to man. And when man\nceases to be man and enters the “I am God” state, he realizes that\nangels and archangels are in fact his own attributes in one sense\nor a nother.\nFinally the dissolution of the higher seven sub- s p h e res of the\nf o u rth—the composite—sphere, is the phenomenon called q i a m a t\nor m a h a p r a l a y a ,and when this takes place the whole of the non-\nexistent existence of Creation, with all its spheres and sub-sphere s ,\nlike a manifested tree, recedes into the unmanifested seed form of\nn o n-existent non-existence, only to be manifested anew once more\nin the very next moment of eternity .\nThe fourth, the composite sphere, is commonly included in the\nﬁrst three spheres as follows:\n1. The gross sphere plus part of the fourth, the composite sphere ,\nis the a l a m-e-nasut of the Sufis and the anna bhuvan of the\nVedantists.\n2. The subtle sphere plus part of the fourth, the composite sphere ,\nis the a l a m-e-malakut of the Sufis and the pran bhuvan of the\nVedantists.\n3. The mental sphere plus part of the fourth, the composite\ns p h e re, is the a l a m-e-j a b rut of the Suﬁs and the mano bhuvan\nof the Vedantists.\nThe latter also call the three (including the fourth) spher e s\nc o llectively the t r i b h u v a n(triple sphere), and the Suﬁs call them\ncollectively do alam (two spheres) meaning the gross on the one\nhand, and the subtle and the mental (including the composite\nsphere) on the other hand.\nThe ﬁfth, the Real Sphere, is also the seventh plane of the Path,\nthe plane of full super-consciousness which, in simple wor d s ,\n15  The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba 233\n234 God Speaks Supplement\nmeans the full human consciousness fully freed from any vestige or\ntinge of duality inherent in varying degrees in all of the four sphere s\nof relative existence. It would not be wrong to say that the f i f t h\ns p h e re or the seventh plane is neither any sphere nor plane but the\nR eality of God’s very Selfhood—re f e rred to by humanity as A l l a h ,\nP a r a m a t m a ,Almighty God, Ye z d a n ,and so on. According to the dif-\nferent states of the same one God from is to “I am God,” and from\n“I am God” to “I am everything,” there are diff e rent terms for the\nd i ff e rent stages or aspects of the Real Sphere—such as a l a m - e - h a h u t\nand alam-e-lahut of the Suﬁs or vidnyan bhumika and vidnyan.\n16",

    "text": "The Types of Conviction and of Knowledge (73)\nAccording to the Suﬁs, the spiritual life consists of four stages,\nand man’s life on earth in all its aspects is but a preparation, con-\nscious or unconscious, for the ever-unfolding realms of knowl-\nedge and illumination that lead to God-realization. These four\nstages are s h a r i a t ( d h a rma shastra), t a r i q a t(adhyatma marg a), h a-\nq i q a t( G o d-realization or a i k y a) and m a re f a t-e-h a q i q a t(Gnosis or\nsatyanubhuti).\nImam Muhammad Ghazali has compared these four stages to a\nwalnut, which has four constituents: the outer skin or husk, the in-\nner skin or lining, the kernel, and the oil within. T o make the anal-\nogy more explicit, we may say that s h a r i a tis the outer husk, t a r i q a t\nthe inner lining, haqiqat the kernel, and marefat-e-haqiqat the oil.\nAs the aspirant advances through these four stages, he acquire s\nan ever-i n c reasing measure of certainty concerning Truth. These\nenduring certainties are known to the Suﬁs as:\n1. Ilm-ul-yaqin\n2a. Yaqin-ul-yaqin\n2b. Ain-ul-yaqin\n3. Haqq-ul-yaqin\n4. Urf-ul-yaqin\n1. I l m-u l-yaqin, or intellectual certainty (conviction), is derived\nthrough rock-like faith.\n2a. Ya q i n-u l-yaqin, or perceptual certainty through awareness of\nGod, is derived from inner feelings, visions or spiritual expe-\nriences on the Path. It is conviction of the soul on the ﬁrst up\nthrough the ﬁfth plane.\n2b. A i n-u l-yaqin, or visual certainty ( i . e . ,conviction by sight), is\nthe experience of actually seeing God every w h e re and continu-\nally; this is antar drishti.\n3. H a q q-u l-yaqin, or certainty of Realization (i.e., conviction by ac-\ntual experience), is attained by the soul on the seventh plane\nof the spiritual journ e y, which is h a q i q a t .H e re the soul re a l i z e s\nitself through itself. This state is aikya (union with God).\n4. U rf-u l-yaqin, or certainty of gnosis, concerns the perfection of d i-\nvinity in man by which man living the life of God knows all the\nmysteries of the Self and of the universe. The faculty br o u g h t\ninto play here is the universal mind ( s a rvabhaumic manas o r\naql-e-kull), which is the seat of all divine discrimination.\nT o illustrate these types of conviction still furt h e r, let us suppose\nthat a man comes to know that there is milk in a certain vessel. T o\nhave implicit faith in this knowledge through intellect and intuitive\np e rception is i l m-u l-y a q i nand y a q i n-u l-y a q i n. If he is not satisﬁe d\nwith this intellectual and intuitive conviction and actually takes the\nt rouble to go over to the vessel and see the milk with his own eyes,\nand thus feel convinced that the actuality tallies with his intellec-\ntual and intuitive knowledge, he experiences the certainty known\nas a i n-u l-y a q i n. To drink the milk, and to become to all intents and\npurposes one with it, gives him the experience of H a q q-u l-y a q i n ;\nand to ﬁnd within himself the knowledge of all that expresses and\nre p resents milk, such as sugar, water, fat, vitamins, etc., and to be\nable to describe these and the various uses of milk to others in de-\ntail, is the certainty of knowledge or gnosis, i . e . , u rf-u l-y a q i nw h i c h\nis the stage of m a re f a t-e-h a q i q a t.\nFive T ypes of Knowledge\nA c c o rding to the Suﬁs, there are ﬁve types of knowledge aff e c t-\ning human beings:\n16  The T ypes of Conviction and of Knowledge 235\n236 God Speaks Supplement\nThe first is the knowledge of the world, which is confined to\nthe attainment of material well-being.\nThe second is the knowledge o fs h a r i a t ,which is mostly used\nby those who have acquired it to over t h row their opponents\nwith the wordy warf a re of logic and argument. This knowledge\nis that of the exoteric divines.\nThe third type of knowledge is that of the spiritual Path; and\nit is found with those who have seriously taken to some inner\ndiscipline and have shunned the society of exoterics. In this\nknowledge the ego still persists, and the consciousness of\ngood and evil still clings to the soul. The knowledge of philo-\nsophers and thinkers is on the borderline between the second\nand third types of knowledge.\nThe fourth type of knowledge is that of God—the Self ( h a q i-\nq a t ) .One who arrives at this knowledge has no tinge of false\nego left and all vestige of duality disappears.\nThe ﬁfth type of knowledge is the real gnosis—the m a re f a to f\nhaqiqat, which, Meher Baba explains, is a complete knowledge\nof God and a complete knowledge of the universe. This is the\nknowledge of Perfection possessed by the Rasool (Avatar) and\nthe Qutub (Sadguru).\nUnless a soul goes through all the dif f e rent stages of knowl-\nedge, the highest stage of t a s a w w u f( Wisdom) which is s u l u k( re-\nt u rn to normal consciousness) can never be attained. Arriving at\nthis stage of gnosis entitles one to be called a perfect Suﬁ ( P e rf e c t\nMaster). There are, however, instances where persons have re a c h e d\nthe fourth stage of knowledge without going through the inter-\nm e d i a ry stages, but they are quite exceptional, and occur only\nwhen such persons are led by a Perfect Master.\nMeher Baba divides all spiritually advanced souls into ﬁve basic\ntypes: God-m e rged (Perfect One), God-intoxicated, God-absorbed,\nG o d-communed and God-mad. The reader is re f e rred to Chapter I,\npages 21–37 of Dr. William Donkin’s book The Wa y f a re r swhich de-\nlineates Baba’s treatment of this subject.\n17 Paramatma Is Inﬁnite and Everything (80)\nParamatma is Inﬁnite and Everything.\nAll atmas are in Paramatma.\nSome a t m a sexperience the gross world, some experience the\nsubtle world and some the mental world, and some experience\nParamatma.\nAs all a t m a sa re i nP a r a m a t m athey also have these diff e rent ex-\nperiences i nP a r a m a t m a. Those who experience (the experiencers)\nand the very experiences are all in P a r a m a t m a. Although the ex-\nperiencers and the experiences are in P a r a m a t m athey are not o f\nParamatma! They are of the Nothing.\nParamatma is the Everything, and the Nothing is in the Every-\nthing.\nHence, the atmas that are conscious of only sharir, pran or m a-\nnas a re not conscious of Self. In other words, such a t m a sa re con-\nscious of the Nothing and not of the Everything. Such a t m a s\ne xperience the gross, subtle or mental world and do not experience\nP a r a m a t m a. That is, they experience the Nothing and do not ex-\nperience the Everything. There f o re it can be said that the a t m a st h a t\na re i nP a r a m a t m aa re not conscious of the Self, and are not expe-\nriencing P a r a m a t m a ,but they are conscious of the Nothing and are\nof the Nothing, and they experience the Nothing.\nThese a t m a sidentify themselves with the Nothing so r e a l i s t i-\ncally that they apparently become Nothing.\nEvery being is Nothing personiﬁed.\nAll beings and things are personiﬁcations of the Nothing—that\nis in the Everything.\n18",

The real goal is to realize God in human form; but those who\nd rop their bodies before attaining God-realization ( i . e . ,t h o s e\nwho drop their bodies in the state of n i rvana b e f o re attaining\nthe state of n i rvikalpa), their goal is liberation (mukti) f rom the\ncycle of rebirth. They experience inﬁnite bliss only .\n2. The individuality of the one who attains n i rvikalpa state is re-\ntained as inﬁnite and unlimited even after dropping the human\nbody and there is a continuous experience of “I am God.” But\nthe one who attains mukti (liberation) experiences “I am a n a n d”\n20  Fana and Fana-Fillah 239\n(I am infinite bliss); and this limits his experience of unlim-\nited individuality of “I am infinite Power - K n o w l e d g e - B l i s s ”\ns imultaneously .\n3. Infinite knowledge is the most important aspect of the trio-\nn a t u re of God, when an individual realizes God in human\nf o rm. Infinite bliss remains the important aspect of one’s ex-\nperience when one has dropped one’s body in the state of n i r-\nvana and attains mukti, i.e., liberation as the goal.\n4. M a j z o o b-e-Kamil experiences inﬁnite Knowledge- P o w e r-B l i s s\nsimultaneously and when he comes down to normal con-\nsciousness, i.e., when he is also duality-conscious and is no\nmore in the state of Majzoob-e-Kamil, he not only experiences\nK n o w l e d g e-P o w e r-Bliss but also uses them while having his\nhuman body .\n21 The Suﬁ Conception of Fana and Baqa (131)\nThis is a short study of the terms fana and baqa as understood\nby the Sufis. Every plane has a fana and baqa of its own. It must\nbe re m e m b e red that the fana of the planes is not the fana of the sev-\nenth plane, and that the baqa of the planes is not the baqa of the\nQutub state—the state of perfection.\nThe following are some of the chief points of comparison in\nS u ﬁgnosis, and it will be seen that their exposition is mostly in re-\nlation to the seventh plane and that their terms have, of course, a\ntranscendental application.\nFana literally means effacement or annihilation. It is a state that\nis not permanent. \nBaqa literally means permanence and is a state that abides fore v e r.\nFana s i g n i ﬁes the end of travelling t o w a rds G o d .\nBaqa s i g n i ﬁes the beginning of travelling in G o d .\nFana i snot to be considered as an attribute; it is not like the\nd i ssolution of sugar in water. According to Hujwiri, it does not sig-\nnify the disappearance of essence.\nBaqa re p resents that which was not non-existent before, and\nwill not be non-existent afterwards, like the essence of God.\n240 God Speaks Supplement\nFana i sthe disappearance of the cognition of ghair (the other,\ni.e., duality).\nBaqa i sthe knowledge of God that one gains after the disap-\npearance of ghair .\nF a n aa c c o rding to Mahmud Shabistari in Gulshan-e-Raz, i s\ndeath of passion, of self-will and of the ego, resulting in the spiri-\ntual awakening to eternal life (baqa). It also means the forg e t f u l-\nness of the false ego (khudi) which has so long been concealing\nm a n ’s reality (God) from himself. If it occurs to the aspirant that he\nis effaced from self, it is a defect. The highest state is to be effaced\nfrom effacement.\nFana is of two kinds, outward and inward:\nOutward fana. This is the fana of deeds and the glory of divine\ndeeds. The possessor of this fana becomes so immersed in divine\ndeeds that he is oblivious of himself and of everything except of the\ndesire and the will of God. Some holy aspirants have attained this\nmuqam wherein they are so indifferent to physical needs that God\nappoints someone to look after them.\nI n w a rd fana. This is the fana of qualities in zat (Reality). The\npossessor of hal (experience) in the revelation of the attributes of\nGod is immersed sometimes in the fana of his own qualities, and\nsometimes in the manifestation of the influence (asar) and the\nglory (tajalli) of God.\nO u t w a rd fana i sa portion of the lords of the heart and of the\ncompanions of hal.\nI n w a rd fana i speculiar to the noble ones who have outgro w n\nthe sway of hal and have pierced the veil of the heart; and fr o m\nthe society of the men of the heart they have joined the society of\nthe converter of hearts (God).\nBaqa that is in relation to outward fana i sthis: After fana o f\ndesire and of will God makes the slave into a master of desire and\nwill and gives him absolute control of the reins of guidance.\nBaqa in relation to inward f a n ais this: The soul becomes nei-\nther God as the veil of Creation nor Creation, the veil of God. In\nfana God is the veil of Creation, and to those who have not re a c h e d\nthe state of fana, Creation is the veil of God.\n21  The Suﬁ Conception of Fana and Baqa 241\n242 God Speaks Supplement\n22 Involution of Consciousness (135)\nMeher Baba comments further:\n“Full consciousness, which is complete as soon as the first\nhuman form is taken, gradually withdraws, plane after plane. This\ninvolution of consciousness (which consciousness is already com-\nplete) begins for the ﬁrst time when the hard-set gross impre s s i o n s\nbecome thinned out. Consciousness thus experiences the ﬁrst plane.\nAs the impressions get thinned out still more the consciousness\nwithdraws (involves) more and experiences the second plane, and\nso forth until the seventh plane is attained. \n“ Withdrawal of consciousness means that at ﬁrst the conscious-\nness which was complete was focussed on gross impressions and far\nf rom being focussed on Self. Later on, in the process of involution,\nas the impressions thin out more and more gradually , with the help\nof diverse experiences of opposites, the consciousness also con-\nc u rrently shifts its focus gradually towards Self. In the seventh plane\nthe consciousness is no longer impressioned consciousness, and\nthis naturally results in the consciousness focussing upon its Self.\nThis means that the consciousness identiﬁes itself with Self as all\ni m p ressions have vanished.”\n23 Five Algebraic Deﬁnitions (137)\n1. GOD = Inﬁnite Existence + Inﬁnite Knowledge + Inﬁnite\nBliss minus Unconsciousness\n= sat + chit + anand minus unconsciousness\n= satchitanand minus unconsciousness\n2.

    "text": "The Four Types of Mukti or Liberation (138)\nC e rtain well-known terms to describe various types of perf e c-\ntion are stated here brieﬂy so that the seeker may ﬁt them into the\nframework of the subject of God-realization. In describing these\ntypes of perfection, the key word mukti, which literally means “lib-\neration,” is used here to deﬁne four types of liberation.\nIn the following table all the four types of liberation ( m u k t i )\nof the soul belong to the seventh plane.\n1. Ordinary mukti (Ordinary moksha)\n2. Videh mukti\n3. Jivanmukti\n4. Param mukti\n1. O rd i n a ry m u k t i(najat) is achieved only after death by some ex-\nceptionally God-fearing, Tr u t h-loving, good souls; and this\nmukti usually comes three to ﬁve days after the soul has left the\nb o d y. Since this mukti is attained without the body, the indi-\nvidual soul enjoys only bliss (anand); and although power and\nknowledge are there, such a Mukta cannot experience them.\nSuch a liberated soul is conscious only of the bliss of Union,\nand for him Creation no longer exists, thereby bringing to an\nend the constant round of births and deaths.\nN i rvikalpa samadhi must not be confused with this or d i-\nn a ry mukti or moksha state. Should a soul reach the mukti s t a t e ,\nit does so after the death of the physical body . Such a soul\nreaches God, but this occurs only after death. Thus there is an\ni m p o rtant distinction between ord i n a ry mukti on the one hand\n244 God Speaks Supplement\nand n i rvikalpa samadhi on the other, because the latter is ex-\np erienced while the soul retains the body and thus becomes\nVideh Mukta.\n2. Some God-realized souls known as Videh Muktas retain the\nbody for three or four days after becoming realized. Their con-\nsciousness is merged completely in their own Real Self (God),\nand they are not, there f o re, conscious of their bodies or of Cre-\nation. They experience constantly the inﬁnite bliss, power and\nknowledge of God, their own Self now , but they cannot con-\nsciously use them in Creation, nor help others to attain libera-\ntion. Nevertheless, their presence on earth, for the few days\nthey remain there, is a centre for the radiation of the infinite\np o w e r, knowledge and bliss of God; and those who appr o a c h\nthem, serve them and worship them are immensely beneﬁted.\nOthers retain the body for years according to the momentum\nof their “ p r a r a b d h a.” The Videh Mukta is the Brahmi Bhoot, o r\nthe M a j z o o b-e-Kamil of the Suﬁs, and he experiences the trio-\nnature of God—sat-chit-anand—automatically .\n3. The Jivanmukta ( A z a d-e-M u t l a q )in turiya avastha (fana-ma-al-\nb a q a )enjoys All-Bliss, All-Knowledge and All- P o w e r, and his\nconsciousness is of the “I am God” state, and also of the thre e\ns p h e res—the gross, subtle and mental; but, being without duty ,\nhe does not use the bliss, knowledge and power for others.\n4. The Param Mukta, who is known as the Perfect Master, Qutub\nor S a d g u ru, comes back to normal consciousness after God-\nrealization, and is simultaneously conscious of the “I am God”\nstate and the three relative existences and their corresponding\ns p h e res. He not only enjoys All- P o w e r, All-Knowledge, All-\nBliss, but uses them in all the planes of existence through the\nuniversal mind and the universal body .\nSuch Param Muktas a re conscious of themselves as God,\nboth in His unmanifest and manifest aspects. They know them-\nselves both as the unchangeable divine essence (zat) and as the\ninﬁnitely varied manifestations (sifat). They experience them-\nselves as God apart from Creation; as God the Cre a t o r, Pre s e rv e r\n26",

Ed.]\n26 Signs of Perfection (141)\nIn answer to a question by a disciple requesting some infallible\nmethod of recognizing a Perfect Master, Meher Baba explained:\n“An ord i n a ry man may not be able to discriminate satisfactorily\nbetween the diff e rent stages of spiritual attainment up to the sixth\nplane. He may be able to know that such souls are advanced, but not\nthe extent of their advancement. But when a sincere and pa t i e n t\nType of Mukti Consciousness Duty in Duality\nOrdinary Mukti Anand (bliss) only; no conscious- No\nness of “I am God” or of duality .\nVideh Mukti “I am God” (sat-chit-anand or No\nKnowledge, Power and Bliss) \nwithout consciousness of duality .\nJivanmukti “I am God” (sat-chit-anand) No\nwith consciousness of duality.\nParam Mukti Simultaneously “I am God” Yes\n(sat-chit-anand) with duality \nand divinity in action.\n246 God Speaks Supplement\nseeker of Truth comes into contact with one who is spiritually per-\nfect, he will observe certain outer signs that are inseparably asso-\nciated with inner spiritual per f e c t i o n .\n“The most important of these signs are three: ﬁrstly, Perfection\nis not only ‘Oneness with God,’ but the continual and uninter-\nrupted experience of ‘Oneness in everything.’ A Perfect Master\nc o n t i n u a l l y, without break, experiences and realizes his own Self\nas the Self in all. This inner experience objectively manifests it-\nself in the spontaneity of love that such a one feels or expresses to-\nw a rds all Creation. T o him nothing is attractive or repulsive. Good\nand bad, saint and sinner, beauty and ugliness, wisdom and idiocy ,\nhealth and disease—all are modes of his own manifestation. When\nembodied Perfection loves, fondles or feeds any living cre a t u re, it\nfeels and enjoys as if it were loving, fondling and feeding its own\nSelf. In this stage no vestige of ‘otherness’ is left.\n“The second sign is the atmosphere of bliss that Perfection ra-\ndiates in its immediate vicinity , an atmosphere that a stranger in\ns e a rch of it cannot help feeling. A Perfect Master not only enjoys in-\nﬁnite bliss but also experiences universal suffering. The acuteness\nof suffering however is nulliﬁed or subdued by the overw h e l m i n g\nfeeling of bliss. Hence Perfection can outwardly appear blissfully\ncalm in the face of every kind of suffering and persecution.\n“The third sign of Perfection is its power to adapt itself to any\nlevel of humanity . It can be as nonchalant on a throne as in a gutter.\nIt can very naturally be thrifty with the poor, extravagant with the\nrich, regal with kings, wise with the learned and simple with the il-\nliterate and the ignorant. Just as a Master of Letters teaches English\nin diff e rent ways to beginners and graduate students, so also a Per-\nfect Master adapts himself to the level of those whom he wants to\nuplift spiritually .”\nOnce Ghaus Ali Shah Qalander, while discoursing on spiritual\np e rfection (faqiri), said, “Giving perfection to a disciple is a matter\nof a fraction of a second. A word in the ear is enough to lift a man\nat once from ﬁniteness to inﬁn i t y, and such a transformation is not\ndependent on prayers or fasts.”\nMaulana Rumi has said:\nDad-i ura qabiliyat-i sharv nist\nBalkih sharv-i qabiliyat dad-i ust.\n“Divine Grace is not limited by conditions of ability .\nAbility , in fact, is conditioned by Divine Grace.”\nHearing this, one of the disciples remarked, “Sire, if re a l i z a t i o n\nbe so easy of attainment, then why is it that disciples are invariably\nmade to undergo a long period of trials and austerities?” In r e p l y,\nGhaus Ali Shah related the following anecdote:\n“A certain man, having two vessels encrusted with the rust and\nd i rt of many years, decided to have them cleansed. He gave one ves-\nsel to a professional who promised to cleanse it in forty days, and\nthe other to a man who undertook to do the job in a single day . The\np rofessional began to work at his vessel scientiﬁc a l l y. He subjected\nit to many diff e rent processes over a period of forty days, and he\nmade the vessel not only spick and span but also a thing ﬁt for use.\n“The second man, who had promised to ﬁnish the job in one\nd a y, adopted the very drastic pro c e d u re of burning the vessel in a\nhuge ﬁre. This cleansed the vessel quickly and completely , but made\nit brittle and worthless. It can be seen, there f o re, that although both\nthe vessels were made clean, only that which underwent the lengthy\np rocess was of any use.”\nThe Master went on to say that it was for this reason that a Per-\nfect Master seldom gave realization to an aspirant instantaneously,\nbut led him to it slowly so that he might become a robust, useful\nvessel for God’s work.\nIn this connection, Meher Baba once remarked to his disciples,\n“Realization can be imparted to anyone in a second. It will then\nbe for one’s own self only with no beneﬁt to others. The period of\na u s t e r i t y, self-denial and hardship which one undergoes with a\nM a s t e r, engenders power and gives authority to use Realization,\nwhen achieved, for the spiritual awakening of others.”*\n26  Signs of Perfection 247\n* [See also Meher Baba, “Perfection,” Discourses, 7 8 – 8 2, for the understanding of the\nd i ff e rence between spiritual perfection and the relative perfection pertaining to the\ndomain of duality .

    "text": "Hal and Muqam (141)\nH e re is a gist of hal (experience) and muqam (stage) in the light\nof Suﬁ gnosis. Some Suﬁs believe there is no appreciable diff e re n c e\nbetween hal and muqam; they maintain that every muqam is hal at\nthe beginning and develops into muqam at the end. This applies\nto all the planes included in the subtle and mental spheres. Many\nhowever distinguish hal from muqam.\nAccording to Abdullah Haris Muhasibi of Basra:\nHal i sthe gift of God; it is as ﬂeeting as lightning, and is secure d\nby practice (mujahida).\nM u q a mis the result of repentance, and is secured by the con-\nstant overshadowing of hal.\nThe author of Awarif-ul-Maarif has it thus:\nHal s i g n i ﬁes a hidden event that descends from the upper world\nupon the heart of the pilgrim, and keeps going and coming until\nthe divine attraction draws him from the lowest to the highest level.\nMuqam i sthe station on the Path at which the pilgrim arrives. It\nbecomes the place of his stay until he advances furt h e r.\nHal is not under the control of the pilgrim; the pilgrim is con-\ntrolled by it.\nMuqam is in the traveller’s sway .\nHal is a gift (maohib).\nMuqam is an acquisition (kasb).\nHal can never be without being related to muqam.\nMuqam can never be without being related to hal.\nSheikh Mohammed Ibrahim, also known as Ghazur-e-Ilahi, in\nhis Irshadat says:\nWhen hal continues, it becomes muqam. Whoever gets hal o n c e\nis a beginner, and whosoever continues in it becomes an adept.\nMeher Baba explains that:\nIn the general sense of the word, hal i sthe inner experience\n(which includes ecstasy , both controlled and uncontrolled) of re l a-\ntive existences on the ﬁrst through the sixth planes (stages) of the\nPath. In the particular sense, hal i sthe state of divine ecstasy and is\nalways experienced in degrees of potency according to its re l a t i v e\nmuqam. Hal in Vedanta is called bhav and muqam is called sthan.\nM u q a mis the staying of the pilgrim on a given plane, in that\nparticular hal.\nHal and muqam go together up to and onto the sixth plane. H a l\nalways dominates muqam.\nHal and muqam do not exist on the seventh plane.\nW h e re there is hal t h e re is duality . When one from the seventh\nplane comes down to normal consciousness and establishes himself\non any plane for the sake of duty , then that particular plane becomes\nhis muqam. Thus for the Qutub (Sadguru) t h e re is no hal, t h e re is\nonly muqam. O rd i n a ry men, who are by nature emotional, can enjoy\no rd i n a ry hal while listening to music, but this is a pseudo-h a land is\nnot to be compared with the spiritual hal of a pilgrim on the Path.\n28",

    "text": "The Avatar and the Sadguru (150)\nThe sense Meher Baba wishes to convey is: “When a S a d g u ru i s\nsaid to be in good health or ill, all this is said and seen and felt by\no rd i n a ry human beings. The underlying truth from the point of\nview of the S a d g u ru i sthat neither good health nor illness nor any-\nthing whatsoever affects (touches) his being (inﬁnity) in the least,\nbecause he is perfectly conscious (fully aware) of Illusion as illu-\ns o ry and is thus fully aware that health and illness are both illusory\n(i.e., they are the outcome of the Nothing).\n“How could the Nothing ever affect him? The S a d g u ru has over-\ncome the impressions of Nothing through the process of evolu-\ntion, re i n c a rnation and involution, and he has realized that he is the\nE v e rything (which, of course, includes the Nothing). Even though\nthe Sadguru remains within the law of Creation, the law itself does\nnot touch him.\n“ ‘ S a d g u ru’ means that man has become God. There f o re, when\nman has become God he can no longer be man, and if he has to\nlive as man he has to act, behave or appear like a man by sponta-\nneously putting into action, that is, demonstrating, all the natural\ntendencies of man.\n“Being a Perfect Master, the S a d g u ru enacts the part (or plays the\nrole, or lives through the role) so perfectly on all levels and in all\nplanes that, under all circumstances and in all other respects, he a p-\npears to ord i n a ry human beings as if he were a man amongst men\nof the gross world. He also appears as if he were one of the men in\nthe subtle planes for those who are in the subtle planes, and to those\nwho are in the mental planes he appears as if he were one of them.\n“The S a d g u ru i ssimultaneously on the level of the lowest and\nof the highest. On one hand he is established in inﬁnity (Reality)\nand on the other hand he is the master of Illusion. Thus the S a d g u ru\nhas under his sway the two extremes, and reconcilement between\nthe two extremes could only be established and maintained thro u g h-\nout all interm e d i a ry stages and states by the S a d g u ru acting on all\nplanes and on all levels simultaneously .\n“In the case of the Av a t a r, the story is quite diff e rent. All the dif-\nf e rence is contained in the fact that S a d g u ru means man becoming\n30  The Avatar and the Sadguru 251\n252 God Speaks Supplement\nGod, while Avatar means God becoming man. It is very difficult to\ngrasp the entire meaning of the word ‘ Av a t a r.’ For mankind it is\neasy and simple to declare that the Avatar is God and that it means\nthat God becomes man. But this is not all that the word ‘ Av a t a r ’\nmeans or conveys.\n“It would be more appropriate to say that the Avatar i s G o d\nand that God becomes man for all mankind and simultaneously\nGod also becomes a sparrow for all sparrows in Creation, an ant for\nall ants in Creation, a pig for all pigs in Creation, a particle of dust\nfor all dusts in Creation, a particle of air for all airs in Creation, etc.,\nfor each and everything that is in Creation.\n“When the ﬁve S a d g u rus e ffect the presentation of the Divinity\nof God into Illusion, this Divinity pervades the Illusion in ef f e c t\nand presents Itself in innumerable varieties of form s — g ross, subtle\nand mental. Consequently in Avataric periods God mingles with\nmankind as man and with the world of ants as an ant, etc. But the\nman of the world cannot perceive this and hence simply says that\nGod has become man and remains satisﬁed with this understand-\ning in his own world of mankind.\n“Whatever be the understanding of man, the fact remains that\nthe Avatar becomes and the Sadguru acts.\n“The Av a t a r ’s illness has nothing to do with the taking on of\nk a rma of individuals. As the Avatar i sGod Who has become man\nin all respects, there is no reason why He should not be susceptible\nto all the natural tendencies of a human being. After all, God has\nbecome man and He is man indeed. But although the Avatar a c-\ntually becomes ill, as a man who falls ill, it must be r e m e m b e re d\nthat He also has simultaneously the background of His infinite\npower, knowledge and bliss.\n“The Avatar never takes on the k a rma of individuals but His\nGodhood functions universally.”\n31",

In the last, the eleventh age of each cycle, the Avatar\n( S a h e b - e-Zaman) i salso present. Besides the 55 P e rfect Masters and\nthe Avatar there are also 56 Majzoobs-e-Kamil in each cycle.

One cycle lasts for about 700 to about 1400 years and is made\nup of 11 ages. Each age lasts for about 65 to 125 years, its length,\nlike the length of a cycle, depending on material, spiritual and\nuniversal circumstances.\n2 . In each age the functioning hierarchy consists of 7,000 s p i r i-\ntual beings (either advanced or perfect). The advanced beings\na re on or between the ﬁrst through sixth planes and the Perf e c t\nOnes a re either S a d g u rus or Majzoobs. In each of the ages one to\nten inclusive there are ﬁve S a d g u rus (Qutubs), one of whom is\nthe Qutub-e-Irshad.\n3. In the eleventh and last age of a cycle the Q u t u b-e-Irshad c e a s e s\nto function as such as soon as the Avatar (S a h e b-e-Zaman or Sav-\niour) in person assumes His own ofﬁce of Christhood ( m u q a m -\ne-Muhammadi). Thus the number of ﬁve S a d g u rus in each age\nremains constant.\n4. The Perfect Majzoobs a l t e rnate in number in each successive\nage, there being seven in the ﬁrst age, three in the second, seven\nin the third, and so on. In the eleventh age, however, there are\nsix Majzoobs-e-Kamil.\nIn those ages where there are more than three Majzoobs, i.e., t h e\nﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, seventh, ninth and eleventh ages, the extra ones\nleave the body immediately after becoming realized ( M a j z o o b - e -\nKamil). This means that in the ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, seventh and ninth\nages, four out of the seven Majzoobs die at once after Realization,\nand that in the eleventh and ﬁnal age, in which there are six perf e c t\nMajzoobs, three die at once after Realization. \nThe result is that in any given age only three Majzoobs remain\nin the body. Thus from the point of view of the functioning h i e r-\narchy there are really only three Majzoobs in each age. \nMeher Baba distributes the 7,000 members of the f u n c t i o n i n g\nh i e r a rchy for a particular age in and between the seven spiritual\nplanes as follows: \n32  Meher Baba on the Hierarchy 255\n256 God Speaks Supplement\nIn the ﬁrst plane, and also between 1st and 2nd, between 2nd and\n3rd, between 3rd and 4th, between 4th and 5th, between 5th and\n6th and between 6th and 7th  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,600\nIn the second plane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 666\nIn the third plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 558\nIn the fourth plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56\nIn the ﬁfth plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56\nIn the sixth plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56\nIn the seventh plane (i.e., Majzoobs in the body)  . . . . . . . . 3\nPerfect Masters (Sadgurus)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        5\n7,000\nThe Avatar , in the eleventh age of each cycle, brings\nthe number to  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,001\nT h e re are always, at all times and in all ages, fifty-six God-\nrealized souls or S h i v-Atmas in human form on earth; and out of\nthese ﬁf t y-six only eight have public recognition and function as\nactive members of the functioning spiritual hierarc h y, consisting of\n7,000 members, who do the assigned spiritual duties on various\nplanes of consciousness according to their spiritual advancement\nor perfection.\nThe remaining fort y-eight God-realized ones are not amongst\nthe functioning spiritual hierarchy of 7,000 members.

    "text": "Tauhid or the Unitary State of God (159)\nThe principle involving tauhid, or the unitary state of God, is\nindisputable. It is the basic foundation of all known religions and\nthe goal of spiritual discipline in both Suﬁsm and Vedanta. To ac-\ncept tauhid in theory is the privilege of the masses, but to indulge\nin research thereof is the specialty of the select few. It is both easy\nand difﬁcult. T auhid i sseemingly so easy that it is talked about uni-\nversally on pulpit and platform and yet it is so difﬁcult of achieve-\nment that the best of efforts therein yield nothing but stupefaction\nand bewilderment.\nThe unity of God, in its transcendent aspect, is the t a u h i d - e -\ntanzihi (Absolute Oneness) of Suﬁsm, and the advaita of Ve d a n t a .\nThe problem of tauhid p resents multifarious aspects, as is exem-\np l i ﬁed by the old story of several blind people examining an ele-\nphant. Each touched a diff e rent part of the cre a t u re and formed a\nd i ff e rent opinion. Individual approach to the subject is r e l a t i v e l y\nquite true and unchallengeable, and yet the elephant as a whole\nis something quite dif f e rent and ununderstandable for the blind.\nThe following are a few utterances of eminent Sufis concer n i n g\ntauhid and the aspects thereof which appeal to them:*\n258 God Speaks Supplement\n* The apparent contradictions in the words of Sufis are merely due to limitations\nof the means to express the experienced truths and to describe the realized Tru t h\nin diff e rent contexts, under dif f e rent circumstances and from dif f e rent points of\nview that always go together in a single experience or realization as a whole. Meher\nBaba says that such wordy dif f e rences do not contradict but complement the ex-\np ressions of experienced and realized truths which underlie such contradictions.\nExplanations in this respect such as have already been given in preceding pages\nshould therefore be always borne in mind, viz.:\nT auhid is that reality in which the impressions (nuqush) a re\nwiped out, and knowledge appears and God remains as im-\nmaculate and pure as He was before.\n—Junayd of Baghdad\nT auhid is the knowledge of God and this knowledge enables\nthe gnostic to dif f e rentiate between the original ( q a d i m )\nand the contingent (hadas) being. The transcendent state\nof tauhid involves the denial of tauhid.\n—Junayd of Baghdad\nT auhid is the effacement of the lover in the attributes of the\nbeloved. —Jehangir Samnani\nT auhid has two aspects: one is the state and the other is the de-\nscription of it. The descriptive aspect of tauhid belongs to the\nworldly mission of the Prophets, and the state thereof involves the\ni n ﬁnite and boundless ocean. The descriptive aspect depends on\nthe instrumentality of speech, sight, hearing and cognition, and all\nof these re q u i re separate conﬁrmation. T o conﬁrm on the basis of\nextraneous proofs is to suggest duality , and tauhid i s f ree of all tinge\nof duality . Faith in a man walks through the crowded thoro u g h f a re\nof duality , and this stage cannot altogether be dispensed with.\nDescriptive tauhid i slike a lamp, while tauhid in itself and by it-\nself is the sun. When the sun appears, the light of the lamp vanishes\ninto nothingness. Descriptive tauhid is changeable, while the s t a t e\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 259\nPage 193: The approach to Truth is individual, and so in the matter of details much\ndepends upon one’s spiritual tendency , physical aptitude and external circ u m s t a n c e s .\nPage 198: A thousand seekers may be enjoying as many experiences, yet the Path\nof Gnosis is only one.\nPage 207: In spite of the dif f e rent aspects of the experiences of the Experience,\nall the aspects are experienced together at the same time.\nPage 228: On the one hand, more details confuse one more, and less details explain\nthings less. This gives rise to a variety of terms and expressions for use from dif-\nf e rent viewpoints and in diff e rent contexts. In the absence of actual experience, de-\nscriptions of the same one thing often sound contradictory . But in the light of\nrelative experiences or the ﬁnal realization of Truth, these very contradictions pro v e\nto be really complementary expressions about the same one truth.\nof tauhid i simmutable and eternal. The words uttered by the tongue\na re overruled by the heart. When one on the spiritual journey oc-\ncupies the station of the heart the tongue becomes defunct and mute.\nLater on the heart, too, is overridden by the spirit (jan), and at this\nstage the wayfarer talks to Him. This talk is not in relation to the\nessence, but in relation to its attribute. The attribute changes and not\nthe essence (ayn). The sun warms up the water, whereby the at-\ntribute is changed but not the water. Thus, “the very attempt to af-\nﬁrm tauhid i sto deteriorate the pristine purity of t a u h i d” (’Asb a t\nu t - t a uh id, fas i dun fit-t a uh id ) .\nT auhid veils for the unitarian (mawahid) the beauty of Absolute\nOneness (jamal-e-ahadiyat). Tauhid on that account is suspect, be-\ncause you desire it from yourself.\nOne who writes about tauhid is a mulhid (rationalist); one\nwho points towards it is a dualist; one who infers it is an\nidolator; one who talks about it is irresponsible; one who\nis silent about it is ignorant; one who thinks that he has re-\nalized it is self-deluded; one who imagines its nearness is\ndistant from it; one who weighs it with intellect, and form s\nideas thereof, is indulging in make-believe; and the one who\nﬁnds it without seeking is the lost one.\n—Abu Bakr Shibli \nT auhid, if spoken of in relation to absolutism (tanzeeh) i s\nto qualify it, and to refer to it as qualiﬁed (tashbeeh) is to\nmake it limited and ﬁnite. To equilibrate the two extre m e s\nis, however, perfect and just what is desirable.\n—Muhyuddin Ibn Arabi\nT auhid is essentially forgetfulness of tauhid. Those re t u rn-\ning to normal consciousness must needs have some work on\nthe material plane. Hence tauhid may be likened to a cre d i-\ntor that can never be adequately and fully paid off in life.\n—Quduntul-Kubra\nT auhid, the unitarian stage of God, there f o re admits of no lan-\nguage, as in that transcendent state there is none to whom to ad-\ndress oneself.\n260 God Speaks Supplement\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 261\nThe Sufis have classified tauhid into five main categories, in\nkeeping with or connoting the dif f e rent stages of man’s spiritual\nunfoldment. They are known as:\n1. T auhid-e-aqwali—the verbal unity of God.\n2. T auhid-e-afa’ali—the active unity of God.\n3. T auhid-e-ahwali—the feeling unity of God.\n4. T auhid-e-sifati—unity of God in attributes.\n5. T auhid-e-zati—unity of God in essence.\n1. Ta u h i d-e-aqwali belongs to the majority of mankind who be-\nlieve in any one Prophet ( Avatar) and have faith in His mes-\nsage. At this stage mere verbal acceptance of God or the unity\nof God, and the perf o rmance of duties pertaining thereto en-\njoined by the lawgiver, are considered enough as a preparation\nfor the forthcoming stages of spiritual life. This is also known\nas tauhid-e-shariat.\n2. Ta u h i d-e-afa’ali c o n c e rns those who have actually been initi-\nated into the Path. The expression of the unity of God with\nsuch initiates of the subtle sphere ( a l a m-e-malakut) s i m u l a t e s\nintrinsically the life of the pure souls, the angels. At this stage\nthe spiritual conviction engendered within is that behind\neverything, good or bad, is the motivating power of God.\n3. Ta u h i d-e-ahwali dawns on those advanced souls of the fifth\nplane in the mental sphere. At this stage the soul finds itself\ni nvested with direct radiation of Divinity and consciously or\nunconsciously gives immense help to others in the subtle and\ngross spheres.\n4. Ta u h i d-e-sifati belongs to the sixth plane in the same sphere\n(mental). All the aspects of materiality from the gross and\nsubtlety from the subtle planes, still clinging to the soul, are\ncompletely removed and dissolved, like the lustre of stars get-\nting dissipated before the sun. Both (3) and (4) tauhid b e l o n g\nto the same mental sphere ( a l a m-e - j a b rut) and all the three ( 2 ),\n(3) and (4) are also collectively known as tauhid-e-tariqat.\n5 . Ta u h i d-e-zati is God-realization in the fifth Real sphere of\nhaqiqat, which includes the dif f e rent stages or aspects of the\n262 God Speaks Supplement\nm a re f a t-e-haqiqat, viz., halat-e-Muhammadi in the stage of l a h u t ,\nand h a q i q a t-e-Muhammadi in the stage of hahut of the sphere\nof Reality.\nThe Suﬁs are unanimous on the point that amongst the vari-\nous aspects inherent in the realization or t a u h i d-e-zati, the most\np e rfect one is the accentuation of the dif f e rence of ubudiyat ( s e r-\nvantship) between man and God. This spiritual fact the church has\nm i s c o n s t rued and misapplied, in adducing that man is man and\nGod is God, and that man can never become God nor can God ever\ndevolve into man. The truth underlying the situation, however, is\nthat after the realization of t a u h i d-e-zati the emphasis on u b u d i -\nyat ( s e rvantship) connotes the third journey of the Saliks c a l l e d\ns e y r-e-ma Allah, the re t u rn to normal consciousness with G o d .\nThe varying stages and aspects of tauhid as discussed above are\ngiven below in tabular form:\nWujudiyyah and Shuhudiyyah\nAmongst the various types of unitarians ( a h l-e-t a u h i d), t h e\nmost important and controversial are the two schools of thought\nknown as Wujudiyyah and Shuhudiyyah.\nMuhyuddin Ibn Arabi is the greatest advocate of the Wu j u d i y-\nyah school, upholding w a h d a t-u l-wujud (unity of existence), which\nin Vedanta is Advaitism, upheld by its greatest exponent Sankara-\ncharya. According to Ghazur-e-Ilahi, Ibn Arabi held that existence\nStages\nT auhid-e-Aqwali\nT auhid-e-Afa’ali\nT auhid-e-Ahwali\nT auhid-e-Sifati\nT auhid-e-Zati\nSpheres\nAlam-e-Nasut\n(First Sphere)\nAlam-e-Malakut\n(Second Sphere)\nAlam-e-Jabrut\n(Third Sphere)\n1.

Ashiq (lover) and Mashuq\n(beloved) simultaneously\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 263\n(wujud) i snot more than one, and is the very same, is manifest to\nitself by itself, like water which is manifest to itself in the form of\nice by way of limitation. When in the state of fana, the limitation\n(the form) disappears, the Absolute remains and becomes Hu Hu\n(He, He).\nSheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardi, one of the chief sponsors of\nthe Shuhudiyyah school, characterizing its philosophy as w a h d a t -\nu l-shuhud ( a p p a rentism), the Vishistadvaita of Vedanta, maintains\nthat in fana, bandah (the limited) becomes kaanahu Hu (like Him)\nand not Hu Hu (He, He), as iron in the fire, which becomes like\nﬁre but not ﬁre itself—the reality of iron being quite diff e rent fro m\nthat of ﬁre. The Shuhudiyyahs deﬁne two different existences (zat)\nand two distinct things in view—iron and ﬁre. The iron becomes\nﬁre temporarily and then iron is iron and ﬁre is ﬁre.\nM i rza Jan Janan says that the relationship between the unmani-\nfest aspect of God and the manifest aspect of God is that which ex-\nists between the ocean, the waves and the bubbles. And this\nmultiplicity does not in any way affect or interf e re with the Oneness\nof Reality . This is w a h d a t-u l-wujud (identityism). In contrast w i t h\nthis, the other position determining the relationship between God\nand the created, as that of the original and its shadow or the sun\nand its rays, is wahdat-ul-shuhud (apparentism).\nWa h d a t-u l-wujud of Muhyuddin Ibn Arabi is from the heights\nof ahadiyat (conscious unity), and the gnosis pertaining to this\nstage is, therefore, “Hama ust” (Everything is He).\nWa h d a t-u l-shuhud of Sheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardi, also\nknown as Mujaddid, is f rom the same heights of Reality ( h a q i q a t ) ,\nbut the gnosis expressed is “Hama az ust” ( E v e rything is from Him).\nThe two doctrines and the resultant controversies are a later de-\nvelopment at the beginning of the present d a o r-e-qalandari ( c y c l e\nof mastery), and so did not arise during the lifetime of the Arabian\nP rophet. The doctrine of the Wujudiyyahs is based on experience\nplus reason and the Shuhudiyyahs base it on experience and the\nQuranic aspects of common interest.\nIbn Arabi denies transcendence and immanence, which imply\nd u a l i t y. He maintains that God is one and it is He alone Who exists.\nAll else that appear to exist are His manifestations or t a j a l l i y a t .\n264 God Speaks Supplement\nHence God is identical with sifat (attributes), and all divine names\na re identical with the named, which is Allah. The saints who belong\nto the Wujudiyyah school of thought have their eyes on the oneness\nof existence ( w a h i d-u l-w u j u d), the first tajalli (manifestation) of\nGod, from the stage of ahadiyat; and there f o re the later devolutions\n(v i z . ,mental, subtle and gross worlds) are like a shadow (zil) w h i c h\nis nothing and as such constitutes an adumbration on zat ( d i v i n e\nessence). The shadow (zil), h o w e v e r, owes its existence to and is de-\npendent upon God, Who is inﬁnite and eternal. Thus the shadow\nalso is in the sense that the Wujudiyyahs look upon everything as\nGod, even the shadows (mental, subtle and gross worlds) which\nhave no independent existence.\nThe Shuhudiyyahs, as said before, hold two zats, the one of re-\nality and the other of non-re a l i t y, the one of God and the other of\nbandah. The zat of bandah is zero (adum) and this adum ( n o t h i n g-\nness) is relational ( i z a ﬁ), and is not real (haqiqi). If nothing ( a d u m )\nis to be considered as an essence (Reality), then there will be two\nzats, which results in dualism. The a d u m - e-i z a ﬁis only relatively an\nadum (nothing). It is mere zero. If any number of zeroes are added\nto a zero the value of the number does not change. Thus adum i s\nt h e re f o re a symbol in the knowledge of God. Since perf e ction ap-\np e rtains to zat, God is Perfection itself. Imperfection relates to\nadum and hence “evil” is the manifestation of adum ( n o n -e x i s t e n t\nexistence). The Mujaddid only re a fﬁrmed and reemphasized the\ndoctrine of wahdat-ul-shuhud ( a p p a re n t i s m), originally founded by\nAbdul Karim al-Jili, the author of Al-lnsan-ul-Kamil.\nThe spiritual fact, however, is that Wujudiyyah philosophy is of\na loftier kind and admits of no considerations of convenience or\nc o m p romise. The gnosis of Meher Baba is equally applicable to\nboth these approaches to Truth and in order to follow it as given\nin the “T en States of God” some familiarity with the Suﬁ way of de-\nlineating the t a n a z z u l a t —the devolutions of the Absolute—thro u g h\nsuccessive stages of manifestations known as khamsa wujudat ( F i v e\nExistences) of the Suﬁ world would be of help to the seeker.\nThe Gnosis of all Perfect Suﬁs implies that God in the Beyond the\nBeyond state is unknowable and undeﬁnable. In compr e h e n d i n g\nthis state of God (Wara-ul-Wara) which is Beyond the Beyond, the\nwings of thought and imagination are paralyzed. In the Beyond the\nBeyond state, the Absolute God (Wujud-e-Mutlaq) is.\nThe Suﬁs have described this transcendent state of God in many\nways, such as:\nGhaib-ul-Ghaib (the Hidden of the Hidden).\nMajhul-un-Nat (the Unknowable and the Undeﬁnable). It is in\nthis state that there is no knowledge of Itself for zat.\nM u n q a t a-u l-I z h a r a t(the state in relation to which all indica-\ntions are dropped).\nAl Ama (the Dark Mist) which implies a state of latent poten-\ntiality of God in relation to its inward aspect of Beyond the Be-\nyond, and in its outward aspect of ahadiyat (conscious Oneness)\nin which zat is aware of its transcendent Unity .\nMeher Baba explains that although God from the Beyond state\n(conscious Oneness) cannot re t u rn to the Beyond the Beyond state,\nHe knows that He was a n dis Infinite Existence, Infinite Knowl-\nedge and Inﬁnite Bliss and from that knows that His original state\nwas the Beyond-Beyond state (Zat-al-Baht).\nH o w e v e r, with a view to making the subject intelligible to the\nseekers, the Sufis have treated the Divine Theme in terms of de-\nvolutions or manifestations of ﬁve different types, thus:\nKhamsa Wujudat or Five Kinds of Existence\n1. Wa h i d-u l-wujud ( U n i t a ry Existence) is the ﬁrst manifestation or\nt a j a l l i-e-avval in the a l a m-e-lahut of the Real Sphere and com-\nprises the stage of ahadiyat (conscious Oneness).\n2 . A r i f-u l-wujud (Knowing Existence) is the stage associated with\nh a q i q a t-e-Muhammadi (Reality of Muhammad) or n u r-e - M u h a m-\nmadi (Light of Muhammad),* the stage of hahut in the Sphere of\nR e a l i t y. This is the stage of wahdiyat conscious of w a h i d i y a t\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 265\n* Haqiqat-e-Muhammadi: God’s original Word realized. \nNur-e-Muhammadi: God’s original Word expressed. \nH a q i q a t-e-Muhammadi includes n u r-e-Muhammadi, but n u r-e-Muhammadi does n o t\ninclude haqiqat-e-Muhammadi.\n(conscious Oneness conscious of Oneness-i n-manyness). It is\nthe second manifestation, the t a j a l l i-e-d o v v o m .\n3. M u m t a n-u l-wujud (Negative Existence) is the third stage of\nmanifestation ( t a j a l l i-e-sevvom). This is a l a m-e-j a b ru t(the men-\ntal sphere) at which point the stage of wahidiyat (Oneness in\nmanyness) begins.\n4. M u m k i n-u l-wujud (Possible Existence) amongst other things\ncomprises the world of angels and spirits, and is known as\nalam-e-malakut (the subtle sphere), which is the sphere of En-\ne rg y. This r e p resents t a j a l l i-e-c h a h a rom, the fourth stage of\nmanifestation.\n5 . Wa j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Existence) comprises ever y t h i n g\nrelating to gross existence. It is known to the Suﬁs as a l a m-e -\nnasut (the gross sphere), the ﬁfth aspect of manifestation, the\ntajalli-e-panjom.\nThese re p resent the ﬁve devolutions of God from the Beyond\nstate, known as t a j a l l i y a t-e-khamsa ( ﬁve manifestations) or k h a m s a\nwujudat (ﬁve existences).\nNow we shall treat each one of them in the ascending series be-\nginning with w a j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Existence) and ending\nwith wahid-ul-wujud (Unitary Existence).\nIn the domain of shariat ( l a w), w a j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Ex-\nistence) means to the theologian the Absolute God from Whom all\ngrades of existence derive their being. The Suﬁs on the other hand\nuse the term to denote everything that is gross and material. Here\nwujud means body , since the evolving soul in stone, vegetable, ani-\nmal and human form cannot be said to evolve without the gr o s s\nmediums composed of five elements. This gross existence in the\nstage of w a j i b-u l-wujud is a great boon conferred by God, as with-\nout it the achievement of the stages of Perfection, sainthood and\nleadership would be unthinkable.\nThe gross body is a wonderful and unique mechanism which\nhas in it all the other four relative and real existences, the subtle,\nmental and sub-supramental and God Himself. Hence the human\nbody is called by the Suﬁs as a l a m-e-saghir ( M i c rocosm) which is\n266 God Speaks Supplement\nthe epitome of alam-e-kabir (Macrocosm) which comprises all the\nﬁve existences, the mystery of which no one can unravel without\nthe help of the universal mind of a Perfect Master or the Saviour.\nWa j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Existence, or gross sphere) derives\nits existence from or is the r e ﬂection of m u m k i n-u l-wujud ( s u b t l e\ns p h e re). The relationship between God and Creation at this stage\nis that of the lord and the slave. The evolving consciousness or mind\nof this stage is called nafs-e-ammara (evil self) and it has the natu-\nral tendency to enjoy anything that is gross. Here the idea of God’s\nrelation to man is known as tauhid-e-aqwali (verbal unity of God)\nwhich acknowledges the existence of God orally .\nM u m k i n-u l-wujud (Possible Existence, or subtle sphere) derives\nits existence from m u m t a n-u l-wujud (mental sphere). Herein the re-\nlationship between God and His manifested attributes is of the sort\nthat exists between father and children. Here God is kind, mer c i-\nful and vigilant towards His children who are car e f ree, with no\nthoughts of punishment or re w a rd, no desire for knowledge and no\ncraving for spiritual attainments. And such entities are commonly\nknown as angels. The consciousness of this sphere ( a l a m-e-m a l a k u t )\nis styled as nafs-e-lawaama (reproachful self) and the cognition of\nGod at this stage is called t a u h i d-e-a fa’ali (unity of action), which\nmeans the entities of this world are exclusively busy with their ap-\npointed task of remembering God.\nMumtan-ul-wujud (Negative Existence, or mental sphere) con-\ntains the fifth and sixth planes of the Path which at this stage\nreaches wahidiyat (Oneness in manyness). Wahidiyat begins fro m\nthe ﬁfth and reaches its zenith in the sixth plane and has explicit\nin it all the details of Creation comprising the subtle and the gross\nplanes. This is the a l a m-e-j a b rut which derives its existence fr o m\nand is the reflection of a r i f-u l-wujud (the stage of h a q i q a t-e-\nMuhammadi). It is called mumtan-ul-wujud, or Negative Existence,\nfor the simple reason that mumtana means that which is non-\nexistent, and wujud means the form or body of existence. Thus, the\nw o rd m u m t a n - u l-wujud signifies that the form is non-existent\ntherein. This stage is akin to the seed which contains within it the\npotential for the roots and the branches of the tree, which, when\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 267\nfully evolved and manifest, go to re p resent the subtle and the gro s s\nplanes. The Suﬁs know this as la makan in which all ideas of time\nand space converge to a point.\nThe consciousness of the mental sphere is called by the Suﬁs\nn a f s-e-mutmainna, meaning beatified or satisfied self, in the fifth\nplane, and n a f s-e-mulhima, meaning inspired self, in the sixth plane.\nH e rein the relationship between God and Creation is that of Beloved\nand the lover, and the idea of God in these stages is known to the\nSuﬁs as tauhid-e-ahwali (unity of feeling). This is the stage known\nas h a q i q a t-e-insani (Reality of man) wherein man comes face to face\nwith God, but has not yet shed his ego and is still in the domain\nof duality .\nWa h i d-u l-wujud ( U n i t a ry Existence) in the stage of a l a m - e -\nlahut of the Sphere of Reality is the state in which God ﬁrst became\nconscious of His ahadiyat (conscious Oneness), and a r i f-u l-w u j u d\nin the stage of a l a m-e-hahut of the same sphere of Reality is the\nstate of w a h d i y a t-e-wahidiyat (conscious Oneness of Oneness- i n-\nmanyness) also called haqiqat-e-Muhammadi.\nIn the state of Wa r a-u l-Wara, God, according to the Suﬁs, was\na hidden tre a s u re and wanted to be known. No sooner did “the hid-\nden treasure” express a desire to know itself, than it became aware\nof itself as Light ( n u r), or n u r-e-Muhammadi, which has implicit\nand latent in it the existence of all the Creation and the manifest\nworld; and it is in relation to this that Prophet Muhammad has said,\n“God created my light ﬁrst, and from my light the universe came\ninto being.” This is the aspect of jamal (beauty) in the knowledge\nof God included in t a u h i d-e-zati (Unity of Essence). Here, the re-\nlationship existing between God and the Creation is that existing\nbetween the Lover and the beloved. Here the Lover is God and Mu-\nhammad is the beloved. God here possesses complete awareness of\nboth Himself and Creation.\nWa h i d-u l-wujud (Unity of Existence) is the first limitation of\nGod in the Beyond-Beyond state and is one of the stages of the\nfifth s p h e re known as lahut. This is the stage of conscious Abso-\nlutism which, when used by the a r i f-u l-wujud (Knowing Exis-\ntence), gives him the experience of both fana and baqa. This stage,\nlike all other stages of the Path, is beyond mind and intellect and\n268 God Speaks Supplement\ncannot be encompassed in words, and includes t a j a l l i-e - j a m a l i\n(epiphany of beauty) and t a j a l l i-e-jalali (epiphany of beatitude).\nTa j a l l i-e-jalali i sthat which confers on a soul the experience of\nfana (complete annihilation), and t a j a l l i-e-jamali endows him once\nagain with the consciousness of nor m a l i t y, known to the Suﬁs as\nbaqa ( p e rm a n e n c y). Ta j a l l i-e-jalali is also ashqiyyat w h e rein God\nis the Beloved and man is the lover; and t a j a l l i-e-jamali i sm a-\ns h u qiyat w h e rein God is the Lover and man is the beloved. This\nl a tter is the highest spiritual manifestation, known as faqr or f a q i r i .\nThus in a l a m-e-lahut and a l a m-e-hahut of the fifth, the Real\nS p h e re, are the stages of Perfection in the respective aspects of\nashiq-o-mashuq (Lover and the Beloved in One) and ashiq (Lover)\nand mashuq (Beloved) simultaneously. In a l a m-e-j a b rut ( m e n t a l\ns p h e re) are the stages of ashiq (lover) and arif ( g n o s t i c), in m a l a-\nkut (subtle sphere) is the stage of enumerator of attributes, and in\nnasut (the gross sphere) is the stage of waqif ( g ro s s-conscious one).\nDescribing these stages in the ascending or d e r, when waqif, t h e\nconscious one, becomes more conscious, he enters the stage of\nwasif (attributes). And from wasif he arrives at the stage of i rf a n\n(gnosis) and from i rfan he reaches the domain of the mysteries of\nGod ( m a a r if). F rom the stage of maarif he is presented with the\nsight of God which confers upon him the status of a lover, and\nwhen he ultimately becomes LOVE, he ﬁnds that he himself was the\nend-all and be-all of everything. In this stage of Huyat, everything\nis dissolved in the “I am God” state of God.\n35",

Truth can only\nbe known after one transcends the cosmic illusion which appears\nas real owing to Maya.\nMaya, the principle of ignorance, can only be transcended when\nthe spiritual aspirant is able to realize that Maya is God’s shadow\nand as such is nothing. The enigma of Maya solves itself only after\nSelf-realization.\n36 Meher Baba Says (190)\nSpiritual Paradox\n“Unless and until ignorance is removed and Knowledge is\ngained (the Knowledge whereby the divine life is experienced and\nlived) everything pertaining to the spiritual seems paradoxical—\nGod, whom we do not see, we say is real; and the world, which we\ndo see, we say is unreal. In experience, what exists for us does not\nreally exist; and what does not exist for us, really exists.\n“ We must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; thus loss\nitself is gain. We must die to self to live in God; thus death means\nlife. We must become completely void inside to be completely\npossessed by God; thus complete emptiness means absolute full-\nness. We must become naked of selfhood by being nothing, so\nas to be absorbed in the infinity of God; thus nothing means\nE v e ry t h i n g . ”\nExistence Is Substance and Life Is Shadow\n“Existence is eternal, whereas life is perishable.\n“Comparatively, Existence is what his body is to man, and life\nis as the cloth that covers the body . The same body changes clothes\na c c o rding to the seasons, time and circumstances, just as the one\nand eternal Existence is always there throughout the countless and\nvaried aspects of life.\n“ S h rouded beyond recognition by the cloak of life with its mul-\ntifarious folds and colours is Existence unchangeable. It is the g a r b\nof life with its veils of mind, energy and gross form sthat ‘shado w s ’\nand superimposes on Existence, presenting the eternal, indivisible\nand unchangeable Existence as transient, varied and ever- c h a n g i n g .\n270 God Speaks Supplement\n36  Meher Baba Says 271\n“Existence is all- p e rvading, and is the underlying essence of\nall things, whether animate or inanimate, real or unreal, varied in\nspecies or uniform in forms, collective or individual, abstract or\nsubstantial.\n“In the eternity of Existence there is no time. There is no past\nand no future; only the everlasting present. In eternity nothing has\never happened and nothing will ever happen. Everything is hap-\npening in the unending NOW .\n“Existence is God; whereas, life is illusion.\n“Existence is Reality; whereas, life is imagination.\n“Existence is everlasting; whereas, life is ephemeral.\n“Existence is unchangeable; whereas, life is ever-changing.\n“Existence is freedom; whereas, life is a binding.\n“Existence is indivisible; whereas, life is multiple.\n“Existence is imperceptible; whereas, life is deceptive.\n“Existence is independent; whereas, life is dependent upon\nmind, energy and gross forms.\n“Existence is; whereas, life appears to be.\n“Existence, therefore, is not life.\n“ B i rth and death do not mark the beginning or end of life.\nW h e reas the numerous stages and states of life which constitute\nthe so-called births and deaths are governed by the laws of evolu-\ntion and re i n c a rnation, life comes into being only once, with the\nadvent of the ﬁrst dim rays of limited consciousness, and succumbs\nto death only once on attaining the unlimited consciousness of in-\nﬁnite Existence.\n“Existence, all-knowing, all- p o w e rful, all-p resent God, is be-\nyond cause and effect, beyond time and space, beyond all actions.\n“Existence touches all, all things and all shadows. Nothing can\never touch Existence. Even the very fact of its being does not touch\nExistence.\n“ To realize Existence, life must be shed. It is life that endows\nl i m i t a t i o ns to the unlimited Self. Life of the limited self is sustained\nby the mind creating impressions; by energy supplying the impe-\ntus to accumulate and dissipate these impressions through expre s-\nsions; and by gross forms and bodies functioning as the i n s t ru m e n t s\n272 God Speaks Supplement\nt h rough which these impressions are spent, r e i n f o rced and even-\ntually exhausted, through actions.\n“Life is thickly linked with actions. Life is lived through actions.\nLife is valued through actions. Life’s survival depends on actions.\nLife cognizant is actions—actions opposite in nature, actions afﬁr-\nmative and negative, actions constructive and destructive.\n“Therefore, to let life succumb to its ultimate death is to let all\nactions end. When actions end completely , life of the limited self\nspontaneously experiences itself as Existence of the unlimited Self.\nExistence being realized, evolution and involution of conscious-\nness is complete, illusion vanishes, and the law of re i n c a rnation no\nlonger binds.\n“Simply to desist from committing actions will never put an\nend to actions. It would merely mean putting into action yet an-\nother action—that of inactivity .\n“ To escape from actions is not the remedy for the uprooting of\nactions. Rather, this would give scope to the limited self to get more\ninvolved in the very act of escaping, thus creating more actions.\nA ctions, both good and bad, are like knots in the tangled thr e a d\nof life. The more persistent the efforts to undo the knots of action,\nthe ﬁrmer become the knots and the greater the entanglement.\n“Only actions can nullify actions, in the same way that poison\ncan counteract the effects of poison. A deeply embedded thorn may\nbe extricated by the use of another thorn or any sharp object re-\nsembling it, such as a needle, used with skill and precaution. Simi-\nlarly, actions are totally uprooted by other actions—when they are\ncommitted by some activating agent other than the ‘self.’\n“ K a rma yoga, dnyan yoga, raj yoga and bhakti yoga s e rve the\npurpose of being prominent signposts on the path of Truth, di-\nrecting the seeker toward the goal of eternal Existence. But the hold\nof life, fed by actions, is so tight on the aspirant that even with the\nhelp of these inspiring signposts, he fails to be guided in the right\nd i rection. As long as the Self is bound by actions, the aspirant, or\neven the pilgrim on the path toward Truth, is sure to go astray\nthrough self-deception.\n“ T h roughout all ages, sadhus and seekers, sages and saints,\nmunis and monks, tapasavis and sanyasis, yogis, Sufis and t a l i b s\nhave struggled during their lifetimes, undergoing untold hard-\nships in their eff o rts to extricate themselves from the maze of ac-\ntions and to realize the eternal Existence by overcoming life.\n“They fail in their attempts because the more they str u g g l e\nwith their ‘selves,’ the firmer the selves become gripped by life,\nt h rough actions intensiﬁed by austerities and penances, by seclu-\nsions and pilgrimages, by meditation and concentration, by as-\ns e rtive utterances and silent contemplation, by intense activity and\ni n a c t i v i t y, by silence and verbosity , by japas and tapas, and by all\ntypes of yogas and chillas.\n“Emancipation from the grip of life and freedom from the lab-\nyrinths of actions are made possible for all and attained by a few ,\nwhen a Perfect Master, S a d g u ru or Qutub is approached and his\ngrace and guidance are invoked. The Perfect Master’s invariable\ncounsel is complete surrender to him. Those few who do surre n d e r\ntheir all—mind, body, possessions—so that with their complete\nsurrender they also surrender consciously their own ‘selves’ to the\nP e rfect Master, still have their very being left conscious to com-\nmit actions which are now activated only by the dictates of the\nMaster.\n“Such actions, after the surrender of one’s ‘self,’ are no longer\no n e ’s own actions. T h e re f o re, these actions are capable of upro o t-\ning all other actions which feed and sustain life. Life then becomes\ngradually lifeless and eventually succumbs, by the grace of the Per-\nfect Master, to its final death. Life, which once debarred the per-\nsevering aspirant from realizing perpetual Existence, can now no\nlonger work its own deception.\n“I have emphasized in the past, I tell you now , and I shall age\nafter age fore v e rm o re repeat that you shed your cloak of life and\nrealize Existence which is eternally yours.\n“ To realize this truth of unchangeable, indivisible, all-p e rv a d i n g\nExistence, the simplest way is to surrender to me completely; so\ncompletely that you are not even conscious of your surre n d e r, con-\nscious only to obey me and to act as and when I order you.\n“If you seek to live perpetually , then crave for the death of your\ndeceptive self at the hands of complete surrender to me. This yoga\nis the essence of all yogas in one.”\n36  Meher Baba Says 273\nThe Four Journeys\n“God is inﬁnite and His shadow is also inﬁnite. The shadow of\nGod is the inﬁnite space that accommodates the inﬁnite gross sphere\nwhich, with its occurrences of millions of universes, within and\nwithout the range of men’s knowledge, is the Creation that issued\nf rom the point of ﬁniteness in the inﬁnite Existence that is God.\n“In these millions of universes are many systems with planets.\nSome are in gaseous states, some in states of solidiﬁcation, some\nof stone and metal, some which also have vegetation. Some have also\ndeveloped life forms such as worms, some also ﬁsh, some also b i rd s ,\nsome also animals, and a few also have human beings.\n“Thus it is that throughout the myriads of universes there are\nplanets on which the seven kingdoms of evolution are manifested,\nand the evolution of consciousness and forms is completed.\n“But only on the planet Earth do human beings re i n c a rnate and\nbegin the involutionary path to Self-realization. \n“ E a rth is the centre of this inﬁnite gross sphere of millions of\nuniverses inasmuch as it is the Point to which all human-c o n s c i o u s\nsouls must migrate in order to begin the involutionary path.\n“This involutionary path has seven stations and arrival at the\nseventh station completes the ﬁrst journey to God.\n“Although the completion of this journey is the Goal of all hu-\nman souls, only a very few at any given moment embark upon it.\nThe arrival at the end of this journey is the drowning of individ-\nuality in the Ocean of infinite consciousness, and the jour n e y ’s\ncompletion is the soul’s absorption in the state of ‘I am God’ with\nfull consciousness, and, as God, it experiences infinite Power,\nKnowledge and Bliss.\n“Out of all the souls who complete the ﬁrst journ e y, a very few\nenter the second journey. This journey has no stations. It is an in-\nstantaneous journey—the journey of inﬁnite consciousness being\nshaken from its absorption in ‘I am God’ to abiding in God as God.\nIn this state individuality is regained, but individuality is now in-\nfinite, and this inﬁnity includes gross consciousness, and so as man\nand God it experiences inﬁnite Power, Knowledge and Bliss in t h e\n274 God Speaks Supplement\nmidst of most-ﬁniteness—the unlimited Soul knows Its unlimit-\nedness in the midst of limitation.\n“The third journey is undertaken only by those who have ac-\ncomplished the second journ e y, and whose lot it is to bear the bur-\nden of the exercise of inﬁnite Power, Knowledge and Bliss and so\nlive God’s life both as man and God simultaneously .\n“ T h e re are only five such masters living on the earth at any\ngiven moment, and they control the movement of the universes\nand the affairs of the worlds of men. Only when one of these ﬁ v e\nP e rfect Masters drops his body can one of those who are abiding in\nGod as God move onwards and complete the third journey to ﬁ l l\nthe vacant ofﬁce.\n“It is the duty of these five Perfect Masters to precipitate the\na dvent of the Ancient One ( Av a t a r )and to hand over to Him the\ncharge of His own Creation.\n“All those who live God’s life on earth and all those who abide\nin God as God on earth, when they drop their bodies, also shed\nf o rever their subtle and mental vehicles and pass away utterly as\nGod, retaining infinite individuality and experiencing infinite\nP o w e r, Knowledge and Bliss. This is the fourth jour n e y.\n“In reality these four journeys are never journeyed, for God\nhas nowhere to journ e y. He is without beginning and without end.\nAnd everything, which has the appearance of being, appeared fro m\nThat which has no beginning and passes back into That which h a s\nno ending.”\n37",

    "text": "second state of God, de-\nnoted in the chart as “II” and termed “God in Beyond State,” is in\n162 God Speaks\nno way to be taken as a state of God altogether other than the most-\noriginal ﬁrst state of God, denoted in the chart as “I” and term e d\n“God in Beyond-Beyond State.”\nThe only diff e rence between State I and State II of God is that\nState I is of unbounded, absolute, inﬁnite Divine Vacuum, where\neven the remotest prospect of the insurge of the inﬁnite whim is in-\nconceivable. There f o re, only at the instant when the original inﬁ-\nnite whim insurges in the infinitude of the God-Is state could\ni n ﬁnite God conceive the inﬁnite original urg e - t o - k n o w, as “Who\nam I?”—that is, only when the aspectless State I of God in Beyond-\nBeyond gets the aspect of State II of God in Beyond. Paratpar Para-\nbrahma thus gets the inﬁnite aspect of Paramatma.\nIt is also to be noted very carefully that the Beyond state marked\nin the chart as “II” is fundamentally the same as the Beyond-Beyond\nstate of God marked in the chart as “ I.” But in the chart these t w o\nstates, State I and State I I, are depicted separately , because even\nthough State II of God in Beyond state is the sameoriginal state of\nGod, yet it is not the most-original state of God which is the Beyond-\nBeyond state. This necessarily follows because God could conceive\nthe inﬁnite insurge of the inﬁnite original whim and could get the\ninfinite original impulse of the infinite original ur g e - t o - k n o w, as\n“Who am I?” only in State I I, when God eternally in State I a s s u m e s\nthe inﬁnite original aspect of State I Iwithin His own eternal State\nI which is the most-original Beyond-Beyond state.\nT o be more explicit, in both these states of God (States I and I I) ,\nexcept for the eternally manifest inﬁnity of the eternal inﬁnitude of\nGod (as the unbounded, absolute, inﬁnite Divine Vacuum), all at-\ntributes, all aspects, all states, inﬁnite and most-ﬁnite conscious-\nness and unconsciousness of God, including God’s own infinite\ntrio-nature of power, knowledge and bliss and all other things, are\nall latent in the unbounded, absolute, inﬁnite Divine Vacuum.\nAll this that is latent in the Inﬁnitude could only have the scope\nof manifestation in State I Iof God, which may be said to differ fro m\nState I only in this respect, of having this infinite scope of mani-\nfestation of all that is inﬁn i t e l y, and most ﬁn i t e l y, latent as the Noth-\ning in the inﬁnitude of God as the Everything.\nThe T en States of God 163\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the inﬁnite original whim of God, when it once\ns u rged, had the feasibility of surging only in State I Iof God; and\nwhen it surged, it did so uniformly in the infinitude of God. But\nwhen the whim surged, the insurge of this whim could never be\nexperienced by God in His inﬁnitely most independent Beyond-\nBeyond State I; it was experienced by God, eternally in the most-\noriginal Beyond-Beyond state, only through the inﬁnite aspect of\nHis State II as “God in the Beyond State.”\nHence, the inﬁnite insurge of the inﬁnite original whim and its\nconsequent inﬁnite re p e rcussions are in reality effected in the State\nII of God in the Beyond state.\nAt the instant when the inﬁnite original whim surged and God\nhad the inﬁnite original urge-to-know—as “Who am I?”—the in-\nﬁnite uniformity of the inﬁnite insurge of the whim spontaneously\nmade manifest both the latent inﬁnite consciousness and the latent\ni n ﬁnite unconsciousness of God simultaneously in the original B e-\nyond state of God, Who is nevertheless eternally in the most-original\nBeyond-Beyond state.\nThis spontaneous manifestation of the latent infinite con-\nsciousness and inﬁnite unconsciousness s i m u l t a n e o u s l y, is beyond\nthe grasp of human intellect to understand and digest. It is indeed\na paradox of the realm of Reality , and it defeats all human under-\nstanding. How could God gain spontaneously His own inﬁnite con-\nsciousness and His inﬁnite unconsciousness simultaneously? Meher\nBaba, while explaining this, declared that this is a fact, and it is of\nthe realm of Reality , but it can never be understood or grasped by the\nmind; it is only to be realized on realizing the Reality. At the same\ntime, in order that we may get at least some concept of this fact ef-\nfected in Reality , and that we may not take it as a mere paradoxical\nm y s t e ry , Meher Baba made us understand this apparent paradox\nthrough the example of a child in a mother’s womb.\nWhen the mother conceives, the child is under development\nin the mother’s womb; and as soon as the development reaches \na stage when, along with other developments, the eyes of the child\na re fully moulded, the child gains the faculties of “seeing” and “not-\nseeing” simultaneously. Irrespective of whether the child, after\n164 God Speaks\nb i rth, sees or does not see, the very fact that the eyes have been\nmoulded in the womb of his mother gives to the child the dual as-\npect of his own eyes. In the eyes, as soon as they are developed,\nthe faculties of seeing and not-seeing are simultaneously contained.\nWhen the child opens his eyes he will see and when he closes his\neyes he will not-see; but the fact still holds good that no sooner were\nthe eyes developed than there was contained in them the dual fac-\nulty of seeing and not-seeing simultaneously.\nS i m i l a r l y, with the insurge of the original infinite whim in\nGod, both the inﬁnite consciousness and unconsciousness, latent\nin God, were manifested simultaneously , which to the limited mind\nappears paradoxical.\nThus God in His most-original State I of the Beyond-Beyond\ngained spontaneously, through His original State II of the Beyond,\nHis own inﬁnitely unconscious state and His own inﬁnitely con-\nscious state simultaneously , depicted in the chart as states A and B ,\nrespectively .\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, on the one hand, with the spontaneous mani-\nfestation of inﬁnite unconsciousness, God in His inﬁnite, u n c o n-\nscious Beyond state, shown as “A” in the chart, eternally remains not\nonly inﬁnitely unconscious of His own eternal, inﬁnite existence,\nas in the most-original Beyond-Beyond state of Inﬁn i t u d e - A b s o l u t e ,\nbut He also eternally remains inﬁnitely unconscious of His own be-\ngotten inﬁnite original Beyond state, shown in the chart as “II.”\nOn the other hand, simultaneously with the spontaneous mani-\nfestation of inﬁnite consciousness, God in His inﬁnite, c o n s c i o u s\nBeyond state, marked in the chart as “B,” e t e rnally becomes not only\ninﬁnitely conscious of His own eternal inﬁnite existence, as in the\nmost-original Beyond-Beyond state of Inﬁnitude-Absolute, but He\nalso becomes, most obviously , inﬁnitely conscious of His own be-\ngotten inﬁnite original Beyond state, shown in the chart as “II.”\nIn other words, only in the Beyond state of God, marked in the\nc h a rt as State II, God spontaneously , with the insurge of the inﬁ-\nnite original whim, simultaneously begets His eternal, inﬁnite un-\nconscious state, marked as sub-state A, and His eternal, infinite\nconscious state, marked as sub-state B.\nThe Ten States of God 165\n166 God Speaks\nSub-state A is of God in Beyond state, marked as State II. T h i s\nsub-state A is of divine inﬁnite unconsciousness of God’s own in-\nﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss. God in this sub-\nstate A neither consciously experiences His own trio-nature of\ninﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss, nor uses them.\nSub-state B is also of God in Beyond state, marked as State I I .\nThis sub-state B is attributeless and formless, but is of highest di-\nvine consciousness of God’s own infinite trio-nature of infinite\np o w e r, knowledge and bliss. God in this sub-state B consciously ex-\nperiences His own inﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁn i t e\nbliss but He does not use them. He is conscious of His Reality but\nis unconscious of Illusion.\nIn Vedantic term i n o l o g y, it is thus that the State I of P a r a t p a r\nParabrahma begets the State II of Paramatma; and in this State\nII, God as Paramatma is eternally unconscious and simultane-\nously e t e rnally conscious of His own most-original state of P a r a t-\npar Parabrahma. This inﬁnite dual aspect of the Paramatma state is\npointed out in the chart as state A and state B respectively .\nIt naturally follows, there f o re, that the eternal unconscious state\nof Paramatma, marked “A,” in the eternal original Beyond state,\nmarked “II,” e t e rnally aspires to attain the eternal conscious state of\nParamatma, marked “B,” which is the second of the dual inﬁnite as-\npects of the original Beyond God state (Paramatma) m a r k e d“ I I . ”\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the divine goal is that the unconscious state of\nGod in “A” should attain the conscious Reality of the conscious\nstate of God in “B.”\nIn short, when state A consciously realizes state B, the divine goal\nis attained.\nFor state A to realize consciously state B, t h e re is no other al-\nt e rnative but that state A must gradually experience transmutation\ninto state B and eventually become state B in all respects consciously .\nThis gradual transmutation of the unconscious, inﬁnite state\nof God into the conscious, inﬁnite state is depicted through States\nIII, IV , V , VIand VII as diff e rent states of God in the chart of the Te n\nStates of God. In State VIII, state A of God becomes fully conscious\nof state B.\nIn this State VIII, the unconscious inﬁnite state A of God not\nonly gains the highest divine consciousness of state B, but God\nb ecomes divinely absorbed in the Reality of His own inﬁnite con-\nscious state and so realizes His eternal identity with the inﬁnite con-\nscious state B of God.\nIf God, divinely absorbed, as in State VIII, recovers and main-\ntains normal consciousness of the mental, subtle and gross sphere s\nt h rough His mental, subtle and gross aspects as an embodiment\nof a perfect human being, then State IX, at the Divine Junction be-\ntween States VIII and X, is attained. After this ninth state, the tenth\nstate of God is depicted in the chart and connected with the God\nstate C.\nThis",

In State X God con-\nsciously experiences His own trio-nature of inﬁnite power, inﬁn i t e\nknowledge and inﬁnite bliss, and also uses them through the Di-\nvine Ofﬁce of God, State X, marked in the chart as “C.”\nIt is also to be well noted that God in the inﬁnite, unconscious\nstate A is neither n i rguna ( a t t r i b u t e l e s s )-nirakar ( f o rm l e s s), nor s a-\nguna (with attributes)-sakar (with form). But state B is of nirguna-\nnirakar (attributeless and form l e s s), and state C (which is also of\nthe original Beyond God state) is of saguna-sakar (with attributes\nand form). It is that highest state of Man-God where God is infi-\nnitely conscious of both Reality and Illusion.\nState III\nGod as Emanator, Sustainer and Dissolver\nIn this state God brings into play His three principal attributes\n(sifat) of emanating, sustaining and dissolving. This thr e e - i n - o n e\nstate corresponds to the trinity of Vedanta: Brahma ( C re a t o r),\nVishnu ( P re s e rv e r) and Mahesh ( D e s t royer)—the Suﬁ synonyms of\nwhich are the terms Afridgar , Parvardigar and Fanakar.\nThe three attributes of God are expressed through the thr e e\nA rchangels, Israfeel (the angel who creates life), Mikaeel (the angel\nwho sustains life) and Izraeel (the angel who destroys life).\nThe Ten States of God 167\nThe triple attributes of State III of God were latent in the most-\noriginal State I of God; these, simultaneously, unfolded them-\nselves spontaneously at that instant when the original infinite\nwhim surged in God and when He conceived in His State II t h e\ni n ﬁnite urge-to-know Himself, as “Who am I?” At that instant of\nthe insurge of the inﬁnite whim, God in His State II gained simul-\ntaneously the inﬁnite, dual aspects of being inﬁnitely unconscious\nas in His state A and at the same time, of being inﬁnitely conscious\nas in His state B.\nN e v e rtheless the inﬁnite original urge-to-know Himself obvi-\nously persists still in God state A which is yet inﬁnitely unconscious\nof Himself. The inﬁnite urge-to-know Himself persisting in this in-\nﬁnitely unconscious state A of God made possible the m a n i f e s t a t i o n s\nof all the qualities and aspects of God latent as the Nothing in the\ni n ﬁnitude of the most-original State I of God as the Every t h i n g .\nBut all that is latent as the Nothing in theE v e rything could be pos-\nsibly conceived as latent in the Beyond State II of God only .\nW h e re f o re, all that is latent in the Beyond state of God is gradu-\nally unfolded, propelled by the inﬁnite urge, and is spontaneously\nmade to manifest as all that is of the Nothing. Hence the Nothing-\nness of the Nothing that is manifested is the Creation; and this Cre-\nation springs forth out of the inﬁnite urge-to-know in the inﬁn i t e ,\nunconscious state A of God. Consequently , it is only natural that the\ni n ﬁnite, unconscious state A of God gains the ﬁrst attribute as Ema-\nn a t o r, of the three inﬁnite attributes: God the Cre a t o r, God the Pre-\nserver and God the Dissolver or Destroyer.\nFor God to have gained the attribute of Emanator, He obviously\nbecomes the Creator of Creation, as in His State III.\nIt then follows most naturally that when God creates, He must\nspontaneously also sustain what He creates. He then obviously be-\ncomes also the Preserver of Creation, as in His State III.\nAnd in the very act of pre s e rving what is created, God also si-\nmultaneously establishes the inevitable dissolution or destruction\nof Creation. Pre s e rvation would be meaningless if dissolution or\nd e s t ruction were not anticipated. Accordingly God obviously be-\ncomes also the Dissolver or Destroyer of Creation, as in His State I I I .\n168 God Speaks\nState III of God is that state in which God becomes the Cre a t o r\nand simultaneously remains the Sustainer or Pre s e rver and Dissolver\nor Destroyer of His own Creation. At one and the same time, God\nthus becomes the Cre a t o r, Pre s e rver and Destroyer in State I I I .\nThe inﬁnite original whim that surged in God and the conse-\nquent inﬁnite urge-to-know Himself made manifest in God the in-\nﬁnite triple attributes of Cre a t o r, Pre s e rver and Dissolver, with all\nthe paraphernalia of the Nothingness of the latent Nothing. This\nNothingness literally is nothing, although it appears to exist\nthrough Illusion (sometimes called Maya35) as the Cr\neation.\nMeher Baba has told us that there is no Creation in the literal\nsense of the word. What we call Creation is a manifestation of count-\nless f o rms of the Nothing. This Nothing is really “no-thing”—but it\nexists in its own ﬁeld of Illusion. It cannot be denied, but it is not\nbeyond the Everything, that is, God. Although the Everything in-\ncludes this Nothing, the Nothing never does and never can include\nor mean the Everything. The Almighty alone is the Everything, in-\ncluding the Nothing; and before Creation manifested itself, there\nwas literally and absolutely “no-thing” but the Almighty as the\nEverything.\nZat thi Allah ki aur jalve sab ruposh the\nIk saut-i sarmadi tha naGme sab K amosh the\nTha faqav maiK anah saqi tha nah vaj mainosh the\nKa-yi nate dahar kya ruh ul-amin bihosh the\nZindagi jab muskura’i hai qaxa ke samne.\n—Munsiff-AsGar\n“The existence of Allah alone was and all manifestations\nwere latent therein;\nOne Eternal Sound prevailed, and all musical notes were\ndormant therein;\nOnly the tavern was there—no cup-bearers and wine-\ndrinkers;\nThe gross universe was out of the question—even the an-\ngelic world was not in existence,\nWhen, with the divine command ‘Be,’ life smilingly sprang\nup.”\nThe T en States of God 169\nThe Almighty alone existed, but He was only latently conscious,\nand hence He did not know Himself, and in the same way that con-\nsciousness was latent in Him, so also Creation was latent in Him.\nThe diff e rence between the latent and the manifest Cr e a t i o n\nmay be compared to that between a seed and a tree. But, whether\nseed or tree, latent or manifest, Creation is always “no-thing,” be-\ncause it is the latent Nothing that is manifested as the Nothingness.\nAll that is latent as the Nothing in the Beyond State II of the\ni nfinitude of God as the Everything is expressed and manifested\nt h rough a most ﬁnite point in the inﬁnitude of God. This point is\ncalled the “creation point” or the “Om point.”* Through this point\nCreation has been precipitated. This creation point was also latent\nin the most original State I of God, in the Beyond-Beyond state.\nThe process of emanating, sustaining and dissolving, which is\nconstantly and uniformly going on, may be illustrated by an anal-\no g y. Let us imagine that a human body is God. The human body\nsleeping with eyes shut may then be compared to the Beyond state\nof God, as State II–A. The very first moment of opening the eyes\nmay be compared to the state of God as Cr e a t o r. The subsequent\ncondition of remaining awake may be compared to the state of God\nas Sustainer, and going back to sleep again with eyes shut may be\nc o m p a red to the state of God as Dissolver. Thus God is the Cre a t o r,\nSustainer and Dissolver, all three in One, at one and the same time.\nState IV\nGod as Embodied Soul\nDid apni thi use Kvahish\nAp ko har tarah bana dekha.\n—Niyaz\n“He desired to see Himself; hence He assumed to Himself\nvaried aspects involving names and forms.”\nIn order to understand how the inﬁnitely unconscious state A o f\nGod becomes gradually transmuted into the infinitely conscious\n170 God Speaks\n* [See also Francis Brabazon, Stay with God ( Woombye, Queensland, Australia:\nE dwards and Shaw for Garuda Books, 1959), 65–66. Ed.]\nstate B of God and attains full and inﬁnite consciousness, Meher\nBaba gave the following analogy:\nImagine the infinitely unconscious God state A, b e f o re the\nC reation came into being, as motionless inﬁnite ocean. A puff of\nwind then stirred the tranquil uniformity of this ocean, and im-\nmense waves, countless drops of water, and innumerable bubbles\na p p e a red from out of the uniformity of the limitless, inﬁnite ocean.\nThe puff of wind that set the ocean into commotion may be com-\np a red to the impulse of the infinite, original urge-to-know origi-\nnating with the inﬁnite, original whim of God, surging in God to\nknow Himself through His inﬁnite God State II.\nThe stir on the surface of the ocean, caused by the inﬁnite urg e ,\ns u rc h a rged every drop of that inﬁnite ocean with the inﬁnite origi-\nnal urge-to-know itself.\nThus Paramatma in His infinitely unconscious state A, b e i n g\nu rged to know Himself, simultaneously bestirs the tranquil poise\nof every atma in Paramatma with an urge to know itself. This could\nonly be understood when Paramatma is compared to an infinite\nocean and the atmas to the drops of that inﬁnite ocean. But it must\nalso be well noted that every drop of the ocean, when in the ocean,\nis ocean itself, until the drops inherit individuality through bubble\nf o rmations over the surface of the ocean. Every bubble thus form e d\nwould then bestow a separate and a particular individuality upon\ne v e ry drop. And this created separateness would exist within the\nu n i f o rm indivisibility of the drops of the inﬁnite ocean as long as\nthese bubbles creating separateness exist. As soon as the bubbles\nburst, the drops, which are and were already in the ocean itself, come\nto realize that they are and were one with the inﬁnite ocean; and t h e y\ngain this consciousness of their e t e rnal infinity in the infinite\nocean only after they first experience separateness and then dis-\npel the bubbles of ignorance that were instrumental in bestowing\nupon them the experience of their apparent separateness from their\ninherent indivisibility .\nAs long as the inﬁnitely innumerable drops of the ocean do not\nexperience apparent separateness, they fail to realize their own\nh omogeneous and indivisible eternal, inﬁnite existence as ocean\nitself. It is only through the experience of apparent separateness\nThe Ten States of God 171\nthat atmas can consciously realize their indivisible Oneness as\nP a r a m a t m a .\nIn order to describe the God State IV of “God as Embodied\nSoul,” let us think of one inﬁnitely unconscious soul (atma) of P a r a m-\natma in state A .\nIn the beginning, in state A, the soul (atma) has no conscious-\nness and has no impressions (sanskaras).\nT h e re f o re, at that stage and in that state the soul (atma) has no\ng ross form, gross body , subtle body nor mental body , because the\nexistence of gross, subtle and mental impressions ( s a n s k a r a s )\nonly can give existence to gross, subtle and mental bodies; a n d\nonly the existence of these bodies can make possible the existence\nof gross, subtle and mental worlds.\nHence in the beginning the soul in God state A, being inﬁn i t e l y\nunconscious and being impressionless, had no consciousness of\ng ross, subtle and mental bodies, and was also unconscious of its\ni nfinite Self. The soul naturally then had no experience of the\ng ross, subtle and mental worlds, and also had no experience of the\nOver-Soul (Paramatma).\nNow this inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious, tranquil state\nof the soul reverberated with the ﬁrst impulse, which we called The\nFirst Urge (the ﬁrst urge to know Itself).\nSimultaneously with reverberations of the ﬁrst urge to know It-\nself, a m o s t - g ross ﬁrst impression emerged, objectifying the soul as\nthe absolutely opposite and most-finite counterpart of the ab-\nsolutely inﬁnite Over-Soul.\nThe soul, being eternally in the Over-Soul and one with the\nO v e r-Soul, has also the inﬁnite potentialities of the Over - S o u l ,\nthough latent in its unconscious state. Thus the soul is also the\npossessor of inﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss.\nT h e re f o re, when the impressionless, inﬁnite soul receives the\nv e ry ﬁrst impression, this impression could be nothing other than\nthe most-gross impression, because the soul itself, which is the\npossessor of inﬁnite knowledge, tries to gain knowledge of its own\n“Self.” This very conception on the part of the possessor of inﬁn i t e\nknowledge is inﬁnitely crude or gross, and this inﬁnitely crude or\n172 God Speaks\ng ross conception of the inﬁnite soul imparted to the impre s s i o n l e s s\nsoul the most-gross ﬁrst impression. Simultaneously with the most-\ng ross ﬁrst impression, the inﬁnitely unconscious soul also gained\nt h em o s t - ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness. With the increasing gross im-\np ressions, the consciousness evolved and the evolution of gr o s s\nforms gained momentum.\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the evolution of consciousness, the evolution\nof g ross forms and the evolution of the experiences of the gr o s s\nworld were all effected as the result of the ﬁrst urge of God to know\nH i m s e l f .\nBecause of this most-gross ﬁrst impression of the ﬁrst urge, the\ni n ﬁnite, unconscious soul gained the aspects of experience for the\nﬁrst time. This ﬁrst experience of the inﬁnite soul was that it (soul,\na t m a) experienced a contrariety (absolutely opposite by nature) in\nits identity with the inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious state A o f\nP a r a m a t m a.\nThis experience of contrariety effected changeableness in the\neternal, indivisible stability of the inﬁnite soul; and spontaneously\nt h e re occurred a sort of eruption, disrupting the indivisible poise\nand unconscious tranquility of the inﬁnite soul with a recoil or tre-\nmendous shock, which impregnated the inﬁnite unconsciousness\nof the inﬁnitely unconscious soul ( a t m a )with ﬁrst consciousness\nof its apparent separateness from the indivisible state of P a r a m a t m a.\nBut the soul being inﬁnite, the ﬁrst consciousness that it derived\nf rom the recoil or shock of the absolutely opposite and most-gross\nfirst impression of its separateness was naturally and necessarily\nmost-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness.\nThe ﬁrst consciousness gained by the soul was obviously most-\nﬁnite in pro p o rtion to the experience of absolute opposites of its\nown original, inﬁnite state as in “A. ”\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, it then means that in the beginning when the\ni m p ressionless, inﬁnite soul was ﬁrst impressioned, such ﬁrst im-\np ression was an absolutely most-ﬁnite gross impression. The ﬁr s t\nconsciousness it (soul, a t m a) derived was most ﬁnite. Naturally , at\nthat instant, the unconsciousness of the inﬁnite soul actually ex-\nperienced a most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness of the most-gross ﬁ r s t\nimpression.\nThe T en States of God 173\nNow if the soul is conscious of impressions (sanskaras), t h e n\nthe soul must necessarily experience these impressions. And in\norder to experience the impressions, the consciousness of the soul\nmust experience them through proper and suitable media. As the\ni m p ressions are, so are the experiences of the impressions, and\nl i k ewise so are the proper media to experience the impr e s s i o n s .\nThat is to say , the impressions give rise to experiences, and to ex-\nperience the impressions, the use of appropriate media is essential.\nT h e re f o re, as the infinite, eternal and formless soul has now\ngotten the most-finite first consciousness of the most-gross first\ni mp ression, most obviously and necessarily this ﬁrst consciousness\nof the soul must utilize the most-finite and the most-gross first\nmedium to experience the most-gross ﬁrst impression.\nThis ﬁrst medium adopted by God in His State IV (God as em-\nbodied soul) is a ﬁrst form which, although it is gross, yet it is so\ni n c o n c e i v a b l y, infinitely finite that it cannot even be consider e d\nas g ross. It is so very inﬁnitely shapeless and substanceless, mat-\nterless and formless, that it cannot lead one even to imagine that\nit is gross. Yet this form is the very first gross form that emer g e s\nsimultaneously as if in three prongs, as the ﬁrst three of the fore-\nmost seven “gas-like” f o rms. If a description of these ﬁrst three gas-\nlike forms could ever be attempted, they could only be described\nf rom the standpoint of density—the first having infinitely negli-\ngible density , then in the next stage negligible density , and in the\nt h i rd stage as having the first traces of density . These first thr e e\nf o rms have no evolution. The next three forms may come within the\nscope of our imagination and may be described as “semi-gaseous\nand semi-material” forms. Evolution begins with the fourth gas-like\nf o rm. And ﬁn a l l y, there is the seventh gas-like form, of the series\nof seven foremost gas-like forms, which is hydrogen, and which\nmay be said to include the electro n .\nIt should be noted well that the first six gas-like gross for m s\nbear no resemblance to the various gases such as hydrogen, nitro-\ngen, and so forth. They are much, much ﬁner (not subtler) * t h a n\nthose with which the scientists of the age are well conversant.\n174 God Speaks\n* This is in no way to be connected with any form or object of the subtle world, be-\ncause these forms are solely of the gross world.\nState V\nGod as Soul in the State of Evolution\nGod as embodied soul now begins to become conscious and\nbegins to “know” the Creation (the Nothingness), although His\n“knowing” of the Creation at this stage is inﬁnitely negligible. Even\nthis most ﬁnite consciousness and this minutest “knowing,” how-\ne v e r, creates more impressions (sanskaras) that cause the “dro p ”\n(soul, atma, s e lf) to leave or dissociate from the original ﬁrst bubble\n( f o rm). Leaving the bubble is equivalent to a dropping off of, or\ndissociating from, the ﬁrst form.\nEven after the form is dropped, the impressions gathered by the\nevolving consciousness of the soul do not vanish. These impr e s-\nsions remain associated with the evolved consciousness and cause\nthe evolving consciousness of the soul to associate with another ap-\np ropriate and superior bubble (form). The soul is thus able to\nknow or experience more of the Creation through the second form .\nThe “angle of vision” widens and the consciousness of “knowing”\ni n c reases in pr o p o rtion to the simultaneous evolution of for m .\nWith the evolution or growth in gross consciousness the impr e s-\nsions (sanskaras) also increase and cause the soul to assume or as-\nsociate with a still more complex gross form in accordance with the\nimpressions retained by the consciousness when the second gross\nform is abandoned.\nIn this way the evolution of consciousness pro g resses for ages,\nc o n c u rrently with the evolution of forms which help to experience,\nand concurrently exhaust, the impressions gathered, until after\ncountless changes of forms, through more concrete and successive\nstages of stones, metals, plants, worms, ﬁshes, birds and animals,\nthe soul takes on the human form.\nIn other words, the cycle of evolution of consciousness of soul\ncontinues evolving further and greater consciousness with the evo-\nlution of forms of higher and higher types, while experiencing a n d\nexhausting the impressions of the dissociated forms of the next\nlower type.\nConsequently the evolution of consciousness of souls appar-\nently tends the souls to identify themselves with, and gather varied\ninnumerable impressions of, higher and higher gross species of\nThe Ten States of God 175\nf o rms, unlimited in number, in the gross world. The clean-cut\nmajor forms with which the souls associate, with every leap of\ng reater and greater consciousness, are in accordance with the leaps\nf rom stone to metal, from metal to plant, from plant to worm, fro m\nw o rm to ﬁsh, from ﬁsh to bird, from bird to animal, and ultimately\nthe last and seventh leap is from animal to human form.\nIt is very important to understand that the process of evolution\nof consciousness concerns the evolution of bubbles or forms only,\nand not the “drops” or the souls. The souls remain as indivisible\nand inﬁnite as the unlimited ocean ( P a r a m a t m a )f rom the begin-\nning until the end of evolution of consciousness, which term i n a t e s\nwith the completion of evolution of form.\nOnly through this evolution of form does the consciousness\nof ignorance, or the “knowing” of Creation, increase step by step\ndue to varied impressions; and only in the human form can the in-\ndividualized soul ( a t m a )eventually realize the Over-Soul or P a r a m-\natma. As the soul is inﬁnite, the consciousness of the soul must also\nbecome infinite; and because consciousness can become infinite\nonly in human form, the human form is there f o re the ﬁn a lstage of\nevolution of form.\nThe soul has to pass through eight million, four hundred thou-\nsand (eighty-four l a k h s) human forms after it has once commenced\nto r e i n c a rnate in the human form until it has attained God-\nrealization. The prehuman forms through which it has to pass be-\nfore it can incarnate in the human form are innumerable.\nStrictly speaking there is only one form—the human for m —\nwhich is latent in all of the previous forms. The mineral, the plant\nand the animal forms actually contain the human form in its latent\nstate, and this is gradually and increasingly manifested until it is at\nlast completely expressed as a human being in a human body .\nB e f o re the human form becomes completely manifested in a\nhuman body , such as a man or a woman, the latent human form\nmakes a series of partial turns. In the crystalline rock state (such as\ngranite) the latent human form is completely upside down, and is\nalmost so in the plant state as well. As the forms pro g ress or evolve,\nthe axis of the body rotates slowly , so that it becomes more and\n176 God Speaks\nm o re horizontal; and when we reach the higher vertebrates, we ﬁn d\nthe head rising up more and more, as the axis of the body ap-\nproaches the vertical. In men and women we ﬁnd the human form\ncompletely expressed and completely vertical.\nThe details of this evolution of form are extremely complex.\nT h e re are, for example, certain species of stone, metal, plant and\nanimal that have what Meher Baba described as a special “seat” in\nevolution. These key species of forms are mostly those that are mile-\nstones on the evolutionary road, and they mark the first and the\nlast of a certain general class of species of forms. For example, the\nﬁrst species of bird-form to follow the last species of ﬁsh-form and\nthe ﬁrst species of the animal-form to follow the last species of the\nbird-form have a special “seat” signiﬁcance in evolution.\nMeher Baba tells us that this whole theme has been explained\ndown to the last detail in his own book * that is still to be handed\nover to the world.\nJust as there is evolution of consciousness and evolution of\nforms, so also there is evolution of the worlds.\nThe evolved consciousness of the soul, identifying the soul with\nevolved forms, gets more and more impressioned; and in order t o\nexhaust these impressions, it consistently ﬁnds its ﬁeld of expre s-\nsion; and it experiences these impressions on the earth, which is\nalso evolving concurrently with other worlds in accordance with\nthe progressive evolution of the entire cosmic Creation.\nDuring the course of evolution of consciousness of the soul,\nthe soul, while consciously identifying itself with varied, finite\ng ross forms, was also simultaneously , though u n c o n s c i o u s l y, i d e n-\ntifying itself with its ﬁnite subtle form and its ﬁnite mental for m ,\nwhich associated with the soul (atma) in compact, homogeneous,\nunconscious association throughout the course of evolution of con-\nsciousness, right from the ﬁrst urge.\nDuring the whole course of the evolution of consciousness\nwhile the soul frequently and consciously dissociates itself fr o m\nThe Ten States of God 177\n* [The book re f e rred to should not be confused with this publication. Meher Baba\nhas authored an additional work, which might be published later. Ed.]\nthe ﬁnite gross forms, which act as media to experience and exhaust\nthe impressions while evolving greater and greater consciousness,\nthe soul never dissociates itself, consciously or unconsciously , fro m\nits ﬁnite subtle form and its ﬁnite mental form .\nOn the contrary , when the soul dissociates its identiﬁ c a t i o n\nwith any one medium of ﬁnite gross form, it is the unconscious as-\nsociation of the soul with its subtle form that for t i ﬁes the soul,\nthen without any gross medium, with ﬁnite energy—the driving\nf o rce—to tend the consciousness of the soul towards identifying it-\nself with yet another form, i.e., the next medium of the next ﬁnite\ng ross form, to experience the impressions of the last dissociated ﬁ-\nnite gross form, retained and r e ﬂected by the ﬁnite mental form\nof the soul, which is also in unconscious association with the soul.\nIt is only natural that together with the evolution of gr e a t e r\nand g reater consciousness of the soul, the evolution of the finite\nsubtle form of the soul also takes place to fortify the soul with\ng reater finite energy to tend the consciousness of the more and\nm o re gross-conscious soul to identify itself with higher and higher\ntypes of finite gross forms evolved by the impressions of the last\nlower and ﬁnite gross form.\nS i m i l a r l y, the evolution of the finite mental form of the soul\nalso takes place simultaneously to accommodate, retain and re-\nﬂect the increasingly innumerable, varied impressions gained and\ng a t he red by the evolution of greater and greater consciousness of\nthe soul.\nThus it is that only in a human form are the subtle body and the\nmental body fully developed. Hence the soul, associating itself con-\nsciously with human form is, so to speak, fully equipped with gro s s\nb o d y, subtle body and mental body in human form, together with\nthe full consciousness of the gross gained in the human for m .\nN e v e rtheless, although the soul has gained full consciousness\nin human form and so experiences the gross world, yet the gro s s -\nconscious human soul is unconscious of the subtle body and there-\nf o re cannot experience the subtle world; the gross-conscious human\nsoul is also unconscious of the mental body and ther e f o re cannot\nexperience the mental world.\n178 God Speaks\nState VI\nGod as Human Soul in the State of Reincarnation*\nThe most-ﬁnite ﬁrst impression of the ﬁrst urge gave to the in-\nfinite unconsciousness of the unconscious soul the most-finite\nfirst consciousness. Gradually , varied and innumerable impr e s-\nsions, experienced through varied and innumerable gross media,\ngained greater and greater consciousness of the ﬁnite gross world\nfor the soul, and eventually the evolution of consciousness was\ncomplete when the consciousness of the soul identiﬁed itself with\nthe most-ﬁrst human form. There f o re the soul, having now gained\nfull consciousness in human form, does not need any more or any\nother higher forms to evolve consciousness. The consciousness\ngradually gained in the process of evolution is full and complete in\nhuman form .\nThough the soul in this state has gained full and completec o n-\nsciousness, it is still not conscious of its subtle and mental bodies\nnor of its unlimited Self as One—indivisible, eternal and inﬁ n i t e ;\nit is only fully conscious of its identity with human form and its\nvaried aspects and experiences of the gross world.\nConsequently the soul at this stage, only fully gross-conscious\nof the most-first human gross form, and still unconscious of the\nsubtle and mental, experiences in the gross world all of the im-\np ressions of the most-last animal gross form dissociated or dro p p e d\nby the consciousness of the soul in the latest stage of evolution of\nconsciousness.\nWhen all of the impressions of the most-last animal gross form\na re exhausted through incessant experiences by the most-first\nhuman gross form, then it is but natural that this most-ﬁrst human\nform is dropped or dissociated from the consciousness of the soul.\nThis experience by the fully conscious soul is universally accepted\nas the death of the human being. As explained pre v i o u s l y, although\nthe consciousness of the soul gets dissociated from the most-ﬁ r s t\nhuman form, yet it can never get dissociated from the unconscious\nassociations of its subtle and mental bodies.\nThe Ten States of God 179\n* [See also Meher Baba, “Reincarnation and Karma,” Discourses, 301–338. Ed.]\nThe consciousness of the soul retains and experiences the im-\np ressions of the dropped or dissociated most-first human form\nt h rough its subtle and mental bodies. In order to exhaust these im-\np ressions the consciousness of the soul must necessarily associ-\nate with a gross form; and ther e f o re, it associates itself with the\nnext human form to exhaust and experience the residual impr e s-\nsions of the previous human form dropped. In fact this next human\nf o rm is nothing but the consolidated mould of the past impre s s i o n s\nretained of the previous body or human form that dissociated fro m\nthe conscious soul. The association of consciousness of the soul\nwith the next human form is universally accepted as the birth of\na human being.\nIn short, in State VI of God as human soul in the state of re-\ni n c a rnation, the soul has developed full consciousness in human\nf o rm, and there f o re there is no need for any further evolution of the\ng ross form. The evolution of gross consciousness thus comes to an\nend with the attainment of the human form; and to experience the\ni m p ressions (sanskaras) cultivated in the human and the sub-\nhuman forms, the soul has to incarnate again and again into the\nhuman form.\nThe kind of human forms with which the consciousness of the\nsoul has to associate is determined by the nature of previous im-\np ressions (sanskaras) of virtue or vice, happiness or misery , and so\nf o rth. While experiencing the gross world, the soul identifies itself\nwith the gross body, which is destructible, although the soul itself\nis eternal.\nIn the sub-human stage the evolutionary process of form and\nconsciousness is involuntary , yet sustained and continuous, with\nno possibility of slipping down to the lower forms of evolution. I n\nthe human stage, which marks the end of the evolution of form and\nthe attainment of full consciousness, the spiritual pro g ress of man,\nt h rough the re i n c a rnation and realization processes, is voluntary ,\nand is also absolutely free from any danger whatsoever of slipping\ndown to a sub-human state except in ﬂagrant misuse of the powers\nof the fourth plane. Once full consciousness is gained, it is gained\nf o rever and is never lost; and the evolution of consciousness is\n180 God Speaks\ncompleted only when the consciousness of the soul associates it-\nself with human form. There f o re re t rograde incarnation is an im-\npossibility once the consciousness of the soul identiﬁes itself with\na human form.\nWith the development of full consciousness of the gross world\nin the human gross body, the soul simultaneously is associated\nwith the fully developed subtle and mental bodies. But as long as\nconsciousness is conﬁned to the gross world, the consciousness\nof the soul cannot make use of its subtle and mental bodies dire c t l y.\nThe soul becomes conscious of these bodies and experiences the\nc o rresponding impressions of these bodies through the corre-\nsponding s p h e res of the subtle and mental worlds only when full\nconsciousness, which is conscious only of the gross at this stage,\nt u rns inwards toward itself and the process of the involution of\nc o nsciousness begins. This becomes possible only when the con-\ns c i o u sness of the individualized soul becomes satiated with the in-\ncessant experiences of the varied and innumerable impressions of\nthe material or gross life, and only when it has suff e red oscillations\nbetween the opposites of pain and pleasure, for what may seem in-\nt e rminable ages, through the unfailing chain of births and deaths\nin the process of r e i n c a rnation. In the stage of evolution of con-\nsciousness the “winding process” of impressions (sanskaras) is at\nwork with a view to evolving consciousness, developing higher and\nhigher types of gross forms. In the human stage the fully evolved\nconsciousness remains, but the grip of impressions (sanskaras) b e-\ngins to loosen and thin out as a result of continuous jolts experi-\nenced by the consciousness of the soul through the seemingly\nunending chain of births and deaths in the re i n c a rnation pro c e s s .\nState VII\nGod in the State of Spiritually Advanced Souls\nAfter a long drawn out struggle with the life of the gross senses\nin the gross world, the consciousness of the soul begins to get\ndrawn towards the Self of the soul rather than to remain focussed\non the gross body and its gross environment. After a number of\nThe T en States of God 181\nb i rths and deaths the gross-conscious human soul is at last in-\nevitably drawn to embark upon the process which will lead the\nman ultimately to the goal of God-realization in human form.\nThe consciousness of the soul therefore begins to withdraw it-\nself from the world of gross senses and is now ready to undergo the\np rocess of involution. The soul is thus said to advance spiritually\nthrough the subtle and mental spheres.\nThe subtle sphere, or the subtle world, is the domain of the ﬁr s t\nthree planes of the involving consciousness of the soul; the fourth\nplane lies between the subtle sphere and the mental sphere; and the\nmental sphere contains the ﬁfth and sixth planes.\nThis",

The\ng reater the advance, the greater the involution of consciousness.\nWhen the soul becomes conscious of the subtle sphere thro u g h\nthe subtle body , it identiﬁes itself with the subtle body; and when\nit is conscious of the mental sphere through the mental body , it\ni d e n t i ﬁes itself with the mental body , just as it identiﬁed itself with\nthe gross body when it was conscious of the gross sphere through the\ngross body .\nThe spiritual pro g ress of the soul through these spheres is en-\nt i rely in imagination. The pilgrim’s pr o g ress in the involution of\nhis consciousness consists in replacing one realm of imagination\nfor a better and higher level of imagination, right from the first\nt h rough the sixth plane of involving consciousness. In the seventh\nplane the involving process is complete, imagination comes to an\nend and Reality is realized and is no longer a concept.\nThose who enter the spiritual path and tread upon it without\nthe help of a Master to guide them very often get lost in the laby-\nrinths of sights and illuminations, and have little or no chance of\nredeeming themselves from that position. They are like childr e n\nwho, on their way to school, get distracted by the sights and at-\ntractions of the market place.\nThe enchantment on the spiritual path is so great and the en-\nticement so intense that even in the earlier stages of the journey the\npilgrim has a pseudo-sense of God-realization from which he cannot\n182 God Speaks\ne m e rge unless helped by Perfect Masters. Many an advanced pil-\ngrim in the subtle sphere thinks that he has gained complete free-\ndom from births and deaths—although this is not so. The delusion\nremains up to the sixth plane of involving consciousness, but it is\nmost conspicuous between the third and fourth planes. The fourt h\nplane of consciousness is the most tr e a c h e rous stage in the pil-\ng r i m ’s pro g ress, because this is the stage when all the powers of the\ni n ﬁnite Energy of the subtle sphere are under his direct comm a n d .\nThe misuse of these powers means the downfall and disintegration\nof the consciousness of the soul. Though it is a fundamental fact\nthat once consciousness is gained it can never be lost, yet an ex-\nception to this rule can occur, but only at the fourth plane w h e re\nt h e re is a good possibility of the consciousness gained by the soul\nbeing disintegrated. While it is never lost completely, it disinte-\ngrates as far back as the consciousness of the stone-form. The whole\np rocess of evolution of consciousness then has to be repeated to re-\ngain the full consciousness and the human form.\nThus it is that from the fourth plane the pilgrim on the spiri-\ntual path may either fall back due to the abuse or wrong use of\nt ajalliyat (siddhis), or pro g ress by further involution of his con-\nsciousness to fifth plane consciousness, and capture the experi-\nence of the mental sphere or the mental world. Crossing the fourt h\nplane and stepping into the ﬁfth would mean gaining approach to\nthe Divine Gate!\nIn the sixth plane the pilgrim “sees” God face to face. This see-\ning is through the mental eye when the consciousness of the soul\nidentifies the soul with the mental body . Even when the pilgrim\nsees God face to face in the sixth plane of his involving con-\nsciousness, the grip of duality is not overcome, because the seer\nand the seen are still differentiated through the seeing.\nImagination on the planes ceases as soon as the pilgrim cro s s e s\nthe ﬁeld of Illusion and enters the realm of Reality in the seventh\nplane of completely involved consciousness, where he is absolutely\nf ree of all traces of impressions. The seventh plane consciousness is\nfull, as well as mature, and is the impressionless consciousness w h i c h\ni d e n t i ﬁes the soul with its “Self.” The soul then feels and experiences\nThe Ten States of God 183\nconsciously its eternal existence as God. The “drop” (soul), devoid\nof any bubble (form of ignorance in Illusion), realizes its eter n a l\nexistence in the inﬁnite ocean, as the ocean itself (the Paramatma o r\nthe Over- S o u l ) .\nState VIII\nGod as the Divinely Absorbed\nThis state of God signiﬁes for the soul the end of the long evo-\nl u t i o n a ry struggle, the end of the r e i n c a rnation process and the\nend of the realization process through the planes. For the individ-\nual soul there is no higher stage toward which to aspire, because\nit has reached the goal by becoming one with God. The God-\nrealized pilgrim of this stage is known to the Suﬁ world as a M a j-\nzoob and the Vedantist calls him a Brahmi Bhoot. The Majzoob has\nno body-consciousness and no consciousness of the three sphere s ,\nthe gross, the subtle and the mental. This means that in this State\nVIII, God as Majzoob consciously experiences His own infinite\nt r i o - n a t u re of infinite power, knowledge and bliss, but does not\nmake use of these inﬁnite aspects of His nature.\nIn this State VIII, the unconscious, inﬁnite state A of God (the\nunconscious P a r a m a t m a) not only gains the highest divine con-\nsciousness of state B of God (the conscious P a r a m a t m a) but in this\nstate God becomes divinely absorbed in the reality of His own in-\nﬁnite, conscious state, and thus realizes His eternal identity with\nthe inﬁnite, conscious state B of God.\nThis State VIII of God is of the highest divine consciousness,\nwhich is the ahadiyat (halat-e-Muhammadi) or the vidnyan.

Whether God is in the state\nof Man-God, as Perfect Master, or in the state of God-Man, as Ava-\nt a r, He is in this tenth state and functions as a Man-God and as a\nGod-Man from the divine office muqam-e-Muhammadi or v i d-\nnyan bhumika, depicted in the chart as “C.” The first manifestation\nof God, with His inﬁnite consciousness, assumed this divine ofﬁc e ,\nand this ofﬁce will ever continue to function eternally to radiate in-\nﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss, which the Perfect Masters and\nthe Avatar not only eternally experience, but also use for the eman-\ncipation of all souls who are still in the grip of ignorance, tr y i n g\n186 God Speaks\nto gain consciousness of their eternal state of oneness with the\nOver-Soul.\nIn other words, God in a human body will everlastingly mani-\nfest Himself in all of His perfection only through this divine ofﬁce\nmarked “C” in the chart “The Ten States of God.”\nIt was only through this divine ofﬁce that God, as God-Man, in\nthe form of Zoroaster, Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad\nand others, manifested Himself and proclaimed in every cycle,\nage after age, that He is the Saviour, the Prophet, the Messiah, the\nSon-of-God, the Av a t a r, the Rasool, the Buddha and so forth. And\nit is only through this divine ofﬁce that the ﬁve Perfect Masters or\nthe Qutubs or the S a d g u rus function as the summum bonum of the\nwhole cosmic Cre a t i o n .\nThe Suﬁs call this divine ofﬁce “muqam-e-Muhammadi,” a f t e r\nthe name of the Prophet Muhammad, the Rasool of God, in His\nhaqiqat-e-Muhammadi. S i m i l a r l y, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God,\nis—like Muhammad, Zoro a s t e r, Krishna, Rama, Buddha—the God-\nMan; whilst “Christ,” like haqiqat-e-Muhammadi, is the divine state\nof Jesus.\nWhen we try to put together all the diff e rent stages of God in a\nnutshell, ﬁve distinct stages, in the travail of the unconscious P a r a m-\natma to gain complete consciousness, become conspicuous.\nThe First Stage\n1. To begin with, atma (soul) and Paramatma ( O v e r-Soul) are\nboth one in the inﬁnite, indivisible “Oneness of Reality .”\n2. B e f o re the beginning of the Beginning, Paramatma and all a t m a s\nwere unconscious and unimpressioned.\n3. In the beginning, atma had no consciousness of the gross body ,\nsubtle body or mental body , and there f o re had no experience of\nthe gross world, the subtle world or the mental world. A t m a\nwas even unconscious of its own Self and therefore had no ex-\nperience of its own Paramatma state.\nThis is the stage depicted as state A in the chart of the T e n\nStates of God.\nThe T en States of God 187\nThe Second Stage\nA t m agains consciousness and has impressions. At this stage\na t m ais conscious either of the gross body or the subtle body or the\nmental body and experiences either the gross world or the subtle\nworld or the mental world; but a t m ais still unconscious of its own\nSelf and therefore does not experience the Paramatma state yet.\nThis is the stage as in States III, IV , V , VIand VII a c c o rding to\nthe chart.\nThe Third Stage\nA t m abecomes impressionless but retains full and complete con-\nsciousness. This complete consciousness is now no longer of the\ngross body, the subtle body or the mental body, and therefore atma\nno longer experiences the gross world, the subtle world or the men-\ntal world.\nThis consciousness that is retained is of a t m a ’s own infinite\nSelf, and there f o re atma now experiences the P a r a m a t m astate con-\nsciously and experiences the inﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss of\nthe “I am God” state.\nThis is the stage noted as State VIII in the chart.\nThe Fourth Stage\nAtma recovers the so-called normal consciousness of the gross\nb o d y, the subtle body and the mental body and there f o re once again\nexperiences, at one and the same time, the gross world, the subtle\nworld and the mental world. At this stage, atma is simultaneously\nalso conscious of its own inﬁnite Self and experiences the inﬁn i t e\npower, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss of its own Paramatma\nstate, but a t m acannot use these infinite attributes even though,\nat this stage, it is conscious of its gross, subtle and mental bodies\nand experiences simultaneously the three worlds.\nThis is the stage of State IX in the chart.\n188 God Speaks\nThe Fifth Stage\nA t m ais fully and completely conscious of the gross body , the\nsubtle body and the mental body , and experiences the gross world,\nthe subtle world and the mental world simultaneously with having\nthe highest divine consciousness of its infinite Self, and also ex-\nperiences and uses the inﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and in-\nﬁnite bliss of its own Paramatma state.\nThis is the stage of State X as shown in the chart of the T en States\nof God.*\nThe Ten States of God 189\n* [A summary by Meher Baba of different terms for status, state, stage or aspect and\ngnosis in the eternal sphere of Reality appears on pages 2 7 8 – 2 7 9.

    "text": "PART 2\nThe Initial Urge and the Journey of \nEvolving Consciousness\nLET US now think of one unconscious soul.\nI\nn the beginning the soul had no impressions (sanskaras) a n d\nno consciousness.\nT h e re f o re at this stage or in this state, the soul had no gr o s s\nf o rm or body , subtle body or mental body , because only the ex-\nistence of gross, subtle and mental impressions (sanskaras) c a n\ngive existence to gross, subtle and mental bodies, and only the\nexistence of these bodies can make possible the existence of gro s s ,\nsubtle and mental worlds.\nHence in the beginning the soul had no consciousness of gro s s ,\nsubtle and mental bodies and was also unconscious of its own self,\nand the soul then naturally had no experience of the gross, subtle\nand mental worlds and also had no experience of the Over - S o u l\n(Paramatma).\nThis inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious tranquil state of the\nsoul reverberated with an impulse which we call THE FIRST URGE\n(the ﬁrst urge to know Itself).\nThe ﬁrst urge was latent in Paramatma.\nWhen we compare Paramatma to an inﬁnite, unlimited ocean\nand when we say that Paramatma got the ﬁrst urge, it could also be\nsaid in terms of comparison that the inﬁnite, unlimited ocean got\nthe ﬁrst urge or THE WHIM.*\nIn the Inﬁnite, both ﬁnite and inﬁnite are included.\n8\n* [See also Meher Baba, “The Whim from the Beyond,” Beams from Meher Baba on the\nSpiritual Panorama(San Francisco: Suﬁsm Reoriented, Inc., 1 9 5 8), 7 – 1 1. Ed.]\n\nNow was this ﬁrst urge inﬁnite or ﬁnite, and was it at ﬁrst ﬁn i t e\nand then inﬁnite or vice versa?\nThe ﬁrst urge was most ﬁnite, but this ﬁrst urge was of the Inﬁn i t e .\nThis most ﬁnite ﬁrst urge was of the inﬁnite Ocean-P a r a m a t m a ,\nand the manifestation of this latent most ﬁnite ﬁrst urge of the In-\nf i n i t e w a sre s t r i c t e d t oa m o s t f i n i t e p o i n t i n t h e i n f i n i t e , u n l i m-\ni t e d O c e a n .\nBut as this most ﬁnite point of manifestation of the latent ﬁrst\nu rge, which was most ﬁnite too, was in the inﬁnite, unlimited Ocean,\nt h i s m o s t f i n i t e p o i n t o f m a n i f e s t a t i o n o f t h e f i r s tu rg ew a s a l s o\nu nlimited.\nT h rough this most ﬁnite point of manifestation of the ﬁrst urg e\n(also most ﬁn i t e), the shadow of the Inﬁnite (which shadow , when\nof Reality , is inﬁnite) gradually appeared* and went on expanding.\nThis most ﬁnite point of manifestation of the latent ﬁrst urge is\ncalled the “Om” Point or C reation Point and this point is unlimited.\nSimultaneously with reverberations of the ﬁrst urge, the most\ng ross ﬁrst impression emerged, objectifying the soul as the most ab-\nsolute opposite and most ﬁnite gross counterpart of the Inﬁnite.\nBecause of this most gross ﬁrst impression of the ﬁrst urge, the in-\nﬁnite Soul experienced for the ﬁrst time. This ﬁrst experience of the\ninﬁnite Soul was that it (the Soul) experienced a contrariety in its\nidentity with its inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious state.\nThis experience of contrariety effected changeableness in the\ne t e rnal, indivisible stability of the inﬁnite Soul, and spontaneously\nt h e re occurred a sort of eruption, disrupting the indivisible poise\nand the unconscious tranquility of the inﬁnite Soul with a recoil or\nt remendous shock which impregnated the unconsciousness of the\nunconscious Soul with first consciousness of its apparent sepa-\nrateness from the indivisible state of Paramatma. But the Soul\nbeing i n ﬁnite, the ﬁrst consciousness that it derived from the r e -\ncoil or shock of an absolutely opposite and most gross first im-\np ression of its apparent separateness was naturally and necessarily\nﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness.\nInitial Urge 9\n* The sense to be conveyed is that the shadow of the Inﬁnite seeped through or oozed\nout of the most ﬁnite point.\n\nThis ﬁrst consciousness derived by the Soul is obviously most,\nm o s t - ﬁnite in pro p o rtion to the experience of the absolute oppo-\nsites of its own original inﬁnite state.\nIt then means that in the beginning, when the impr e s s i o n l e s s\ninfinite Soul was first impressioned, it got as its first impression an\nabsolutely gross impression. And the first consciousness it (the\nSoul) derived was most, most-ﬁnite.\nSimultaneously at that instant, the unconsciousness of the inﬁ-\nnite Soul actually experienced most, most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness\nof the most-gross ﬁrst impre s s i o n .\nThis inﬁnite and eternal Soul did get consciousness, but this con-\nsciousness by impression was not of its e t e rnal state or its inﬁn i t e\nSelf but was of the most-ﬁnite, by the most-gross impre s s i o n .\nNow as will be explained later, if the soul is conscious of im-\np ressions (sanskaras) then the soul must necessarily experience\nt h e s ei m p re s s i o n s ,a n d i no rd e rt o e x p e r i e n c e t h e i m p re s s i o n s ,\nthe consciousness of the soul must experience them through pro -\nper media.\nAs the impressions are, so are the experiences of impr e s s i o n s\nand so must be the media to experience the impressions. That is, the\ni m p ressions give rise to experiences, and to experience the impre s-\nsions the use of appropriate media is necessitated.\nT h e re f o re as the inﬁnite, eternal and formless Soul now has the\nmost, most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness of the most, most-gross ﬁrst im-\np ression, quite obviously and necessarily this most, most-ﬁnite ﬁr s t\nconsciousness of the soul must utilize the most, most-ﬁnite and\nmost, most-gross ﬁrst medium to experience the most, most-gro s s\nﬁrst impre s s i o n .\nAt this stage it sufﬁces to mention here for the limited human\nunderstanding that the most, most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness of the\nsoul, while experiencing the most, m o s t - g ross first impr e s s i o n ,\ncent red itself in an appropriate most, most-ﬁnite and most, most-\ng ross medium, imperceptibly tending the Soul (without form) to as-\nsociate and identify its very inﬁnite, eternal Self with this most,\nm o s t - g ross and most, most-ﬁnite limited form as its ﬁrst medium.\nThe ﬁrst consciousness of the indivisible Soul, experiencing the\nﬁrst impression through the ﬁrst medium, creates a tendency in the\n10 God Speaks\n\nsoul to associate and identify its eternal, inﬁnite Self with the ﬁrst\nform, the most-ﬁnite and most-gross, which was as the seed of the\nc o n t r a r i e t y, spontaneously sown by the reverberations of the ﬁ r s t\nu rge, imperceptibly germinated and manifested, for the ﬁrst time,\nin the shape of duality . When it is made to associate and identify it-\nself, by its newly gained consciousness, with the ﬁnite, gross form\nor medium, the consciousness of the soul actually makes the in-\nﬁnite, eternal, indivisible Soul without form experience that it is\nthat ﬁnite, gross form.\nThus the consciousness gained by the unconscious soul, in-\nstead of experiencing reality t h rough unity and identity with the\nOver-Soul, experiences illusion through duality and identity with\nthe gross form, multiplying diverse, innumerable impressions in\na series of experiences while associating with the gross form and\ngradually gaining or evolving more and more consciousness.\nIn order to understand more clearly and concretely how the\nconsciousness gained by the soul gradually develops through the\np rocess of evolution, let us examine that state of the conscious soul\nw h e re the consciousness of the soul associates itself with stone-\nform as the most-ﬁnite and most-gross medium, and the soul thus\nbegins to identify itself as stone. \nActually the consciousness of the soul utilizes the stone-form\nonly after innumerable cycles and ages of diverse experiences\nt h rough diverse species of forms, of which there are seven major\nd i ff e rent kinds of most, most-ﬁnite and most, most-gross gaseous\nf o rms, which cannot even be concretely grasped nor imagined by\nordinary human beings.\nIt is for convenience that we begin with that state of conscious\ns o u l w h e n i t j u s t b e g i n s t o a s s o c i a t e a n d i d e n t i f y i t s e l f w i t h\ns t o n e -form.\nIn stone-form, too, there are varied species, and the con-\nsciousness of the soul has to utilize each and all of these species\nas appropriate media, one after the other, in accordance with the\ndiversity of impressions of the soul, to experience varied and\ncountless impressions gathered one after the other in stone-form.\nIf we take stone as a medium for most-gross impressions, it fol-\nlows that the soul, which is eternally in the Over-Soul, now with\nInitial Urge 11\n\nmost-finite consciousness experiences most-gross impr e s s i o n s\nthrough the medium of stone-form.\nIt is thus that the infinite, indivisible, eternal soul (without\nf o rm) which is eternally in the Over-Soul, while experiencing the\nmost-finite gross impressions through its own most-finite con-\nsciousness, utilizes the most-ﬁnite gross medium of the ﬁrst-most\nspecies of stone (“ﬁrst-most” meaning the very, very ﬁrst), and the\nsoul is thus imperc e p t i b l y, though spontaneously , made to identify\nitself as stone.\nAfter ages and cycles the most-finite gross consciousness is\ngradually much more evolved in the soul by innumerable and var-\nied experiences of the most-gross finite impressions through the\ni d e n t i ﬁcation of the soul with the ﬁrst-most species of stone. Even-\nt u a l l y, when a limit to having experiences is reached, the identi-\nﬁcation of the soul with the ﬁrst-most species of stone is gradually\ndissociated and that stone-form is dropped.\nThe soul remains now for a period without any medium, though\nthe most-ﬁnite consciousness which has been evolved remains to-\ngether with the most-gross finite impressions of the most-first\nspecies of stone-form just shed. \nThus the soul, now without any medium or form, is conscious\nof the most-ﬁnite impressions (sanskaras). But as long as conscious-\nness is centred in impressions, the soul must necessarily experience\nthose impressions.\nTherefore, in order to experience the impressions of the most-\nﬁrst species of stone-form dropped, the consciousness of the soul\nc e n t red in the impressions of the dropped stone-form begins to as-\nsociate with the most-next species of stone-form. The soul identiﬁe s\nitself with this species of stone, and the consciousness of the soul be-\ngins to experience, through association with the new medium of the\nmost-next species of stone-form, the impressions of the most-ﬁr s t\nspecies of stone-form .\nThe most important point to be understood here is that when\nthe consciousness of the soul dissociates its identification fr o m\none form or medium and retains only the impressions of the form\nso dissociated, these impressions are experienced through another\n12 God Speaks\n\na pp ropriate medium when the consciousness of the soul associates\nwith the next medium or form. But this next medium or form is al-\nways created and moulded of the consolidated impressions of the\nlast species of form with which the soul associated and identiﬁ e d\nitself and which (impressions) were retained by the consciousness\nof the soul even when dissociated from the form.\nThus, innumerable diverse experiences of countless impr e s-\nsions experienced by the consciousness of the soul through diverse\nspecies of stone-forms, one after the other, lead to the greater evo-\nlution of consciousness of the soul.\nUltimately a stage is reached after ages and cycles of experiences\nw h e re the consciousness of the soul has a tendency to dissociate\nthe soul even from the most-last species of stone-form; and, although\nthe most-last species of stone-form is dissociated or dropped by the\nsoul, the most-ﬁnite consciousness evolved thus far remains together\nwith the most-ﬁnite gross impressions of the most-last species of\ns t o n e - f o rm dro p p e d .\nThe soul, now without any medium or form, is conscious of the\nm o s t - ﬁnite gross impressions (sanskaras) of the most-last species of\ns t o n e - f o rm. The soul must necessarily experience these impre s s i o n s .\nN o w, in order to experience the impressions of the most-last\ns t o n e - f o rm, the soul associates and identiﬁes with another medium—\nthe metal-form. This medium of metal-form is but the mould of the\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of stone-form. In other word s ,\nthe most-ﬁrst species of metal-form is created and moulded of the\nmost-last species of stone-form impressions.\nIt is thus that the inﬁnite, eternal soul without form, which is\ne t e rnally in the Over-Soul, experiences through evolved conscious-\nness the most-gross ﬁnite impressions of the most-last species of\ns t o n e - f o rm while associating and identifying itself with the most-\nﬁrst species of metal-form.\nT h e re are diverse species of metal-form just as there are of stone-\nf o rm, and the consciousness of the soul utilizes these diverse innu-\nmerable species of metal-form as media through which to experience\nthe diverse and innumerable impressions gathere d. Thus the evo-\nlution of the consciousness of the soul gains and gathers momentum\nInitial Urge 13\n\nin pro p o rtion to the diverse and multiple experiences of varied\nand innumerable impressions, through diff e rent media or species\nof forms.\nThis is how the cycles of evolution of consciousness of the soul\ngo on evolving further and greater consciousness with evolution of\nf o rms of higher and higher species, while experiencing and ex-\nhausting the impressions of the dissociated forms of the lower and\nlower species.\nThe consciousness of the soul experiences and exhausts all the\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of stone-form through the\nmedium of the most-ﬁrst species of metal-form. When all the im-\np ressions of the most-last species of stone-form are exhausted, the\nconsciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-ﬁrst species\nof metal-form, and drops that form. But the consciousness now re-\ntains the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of the metal-form .*\nThese impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of the metal-form\na re now experienced by the conscious soul through its associa-\ntion and identiﬁcation with the most-next species of metal-for m .\nThis form is but the consolidated mould of the impressions of the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of metal-form which was dropped or dissociated\nby the conscious soul. A chain of varied species of metal-forms is\nthus created and the soul (or to be more precise, the consciousness\nof the soul) associates with and dissociates from every species\nof the metal-form, exhausting and gaining diverse impr e s s i o n s .\nWhile experiencing these impressions, the soul evolves more and\nm o re consciousness simultaneously with the evolution of the\nhigher and higher species of forms. After ages and cycles, at last the\nconsciousness of the soul associates and identiﬁes itself with the\nmost-last species of metal-form to experience the impressions of\nthe most-last but one species of metal-form that the soul has just\ndropped or dissociated.\n14 God Speaks\n* [The reader should not think the oft-appearing “mosts,” such as most-ﬁrst, most-\nnext, most-ﬁnite, are superﬂuous or redundant, because each species of a cer t a i n\nf o rm—stone, for instance—has numerous repetitions with slight variations be-\nfore going on to the most-next species of that same form, and it seemed necessary\nto diff e rentiate. “Most-last” is used to mean the form most recently encounter e d ,\ni . e . ,the highest and latest evolutionary form of the species, and should not be con-\nstrued as the form furthest down the scale. Ed.]\n\nThis soul, eternally in the Over-Soul, though being inﬁnite and\nwithout form, ﬁnds itself as metal.\nWhile identifying itself with diverse species of metal-form\nthe soul begins to experience simultaneously the gross world in\na c c o rdance with and in pr o p o rtion to the soul’s experiences of\nthe stone-form and the metal-for m .\nThe metal-form, which includes a series of diverse species of\nmetal, is as inorganic, inanimate and solid as the stone-form, which\nincludes a series of diverse species of stone.\nThe soul, or more pr e c i s e l y, the consciousness of the soul,\nwhile identifying itself with the species of stone- and metal-forms,\nﬁnds itself as one with the stone- or metal-form and thus r e a l i z e s\nitself as inorganic, inanimate and solid, and experiences these in-\no rganic, inanimate and solid states throughout the entire evolution\nof the stone- and metal-forms in the gross world.\nThe solid, inanimate state of the soul is one in which life and\nenergy are still dormant in spite of greater evolution of conscious-\nness. Hence the forms in this solid state cannot of their own accord\nmove about by themselves ( i.e., they cannot have voluntary mo-\ntion), and there f o re the consciousness of the soul, associating with\nthese solid forms which are inanimate and inorganic and with life\nand energy still dormant in them, tends to assert recumbent, hori-\nzontal positions rather than to assert vertical, upright stands or\nerect positions in the gross world.\nAfter ages and cycles of varied innumerable gross experiences\no f diverse and innumerable impressions through a variety of\nspecies of metal-forms, the consciousness of the soul eventually\ndissociates itself even from the most-last species of metal-for m .\nThus the identity of the soul with the most-last species of metal-\nf o rm is dropped and as usual the conscious soul now is once again\ntemporarily unidentiﬁed with any form (i.e., the soul is now with-\nout any form).\nIn this state of the conscious soul, when there is no form with\nwhich to be associated, the consciousness of the soul is centr e d\nonly in the impressions of the most-last species of metal-for m ,\nwhich has now been dropped.\nInitial Urge 15\n\nThus the conscious soul in this state—of having no form for\ni d e n t i ﬁcation—is conscious only of the impressions of the most-\nlast species of metal-form.\nThe conscious soul must exhaust these impressions of the\nmost-last species of the metal-form by the consciousness of the\nsoul experiencing these impressions through some appr o p r i a t e\nmedium. And the appropriate medium to spend or exhaust these\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of metal-form is the most-ﬁr s t\nspecies of vegetable-form. This species of vegetable-form is noth-\ning but the consolidated mould of the impressions of the most-last\nspecies of the metal-form.\nWhen the consciousness of the soul associates now with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of vegetable-form, the soul, thus conscious, tends\nto identify itself with that form and actually finds itself as that\nspecies of vegetable-form, quite oblivious of the reality that it\n(soul) is inﬁnite, eternal and without form—eternally in the Over-\nSoul (Paramatma). \nIn this state of the most-ﬁrst species of the vegetable-form the\nconsciousness of the soul experiences the gross world, in accor-\ndance with and in pro p o rtion to the impressions it experienced and\nexperiences of the stone-forms, metal-forms and vegetable-form\nrespectively .\nWhile thus experiencing the gross world, this consciousness of\nthe soul, identified with the vegetable-form, realizes now that it\nis vegetable and has half inanimate and half animate attributes.\nThe conscious soul now asserts in the gross world through this\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm an upright, erect stand. Although this form can-\nnot stand independently by itself, it uses the support of other\nmedia to assert an upright stand. This form is still not capable,\nh o w e v e r, of giving the experience of voluntary movement to the\nconsciousness of the soul.\nAfter the impressions of the last-most species of the metal-form\na re exhausted by the consciousness of the soul through the most-\nﬁrst species of vegetable-form, this most-ﬁrst species of vegetable-\nf o rm is dropped (i . e . ,the consciousness of the soul dissociates itself\nfrom this most-ﬁrst species of vegetable-form).\n16 God Speaks\n\nAgain the conscious soul realizes that it is without a form al-\nthough the evolved consciousness is there. This evolved con-\nsciousness of the soul is now centred in the impressions of the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of the vegetable-form just dropped or dissociated.\nTo experience these impressions of the most-first species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm, the consciousness of the soul, now without any\nf o rm, utilizes an appropriate medium, which is the most-next\nspecies of the vegetable-form. This most-next species of the\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm is nothing but the consolidated mould of the im-\npressions of the most-ﬁrst species of vegetable-form.\nBy association with the medium of the most-next species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm, the consciousness of the soul experiences in the\ng ross world the impressions of that last species of the vegetable-\nf o rm just dropped. When these impressions are exhausted thro u g h\ndiverse experiences, the consciousness of the soul relinquishes its\na ssociation with the most-next species of vegetable-form and again\nexperiences that it (the soul) is without gross form and that its con-\nsciousness is centred only in the impressions of that species of form\nlast dropped. Again, to experience these impressions the conscious-\nness of the soul tends the soul to identify with the next species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm. This chain of impressions, experiences and species\nof form, from one form to another, is so linked that it is appare n t l y\nendless; and the consciousness of the soul, in order to evolve it-\nself fully and completely , has no other course but to become en-\ntangled in this vicious circle until, per f o rce, the consciousness of\nthe soul thus gained, makes the soul realize that it is inﬁnite, eter-\nnal and eternally in the Over-Soul, and makes the soul experience\ninﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss.\nThe point that is important and which is to be carefully noted\nis that, as the cycle of evolution of consciousness of the soul ro l l s\non and on, and further and greater consciousness is evolved thro u g h\nexperiences of further and greater impressions, this evolution of\nconsciousness inadvertently evolves a series of forms of higher and\nhigher species while exhausting the impressions of the lower and\nlower species that get dissociated or dropped or shed.\nThus the gap between the beginning and the end of a series of\nspecies of one particular form, such as stone-form or metal-form or\nInitial Urge 17\n\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm or other forms, beginning with the lowest or cru d e\nmost-ﬁrst species of a form of particular kind and ending with the\nhighest or sublime most-last species of form of that particular kind,\nis pro g ressively filled in by the evolution of forms of higher and\nhigher types suitable to the impressions and aiding the conscious-\nness of the soul to gain higher and higher consciousness. In short,\nin between the most-ﬁrst and most-last species of form of a par-\nticular form, there are diverse species of forms of that par t i c u l a r\nf o rm, evolved to suit the re q u i rements of the evolving conscious-\nness of the soul.\nComing to the point, when the consciousness of the soul as-\nsociates itself with the most-last species of vegetable-form, the\nc o nscious soul identiﬁes itself with this most-last species of vegetable-\nf o rm and experiences the impressions of the most-last but one\nspecies of the vegetable-form that was last shed.\nWhen all the impressions of this most-last but one species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm are exhausted, the conscious soul no longer iden-\nt i ﬁes itself with the most-last species of vegetable-form because the\nconsciousness of the soul has dissociated itself from that most-last\nspecies of vegetable-form. This most-last species of vegetable-form\nis also eventually shed by the conscious soul after ages and cycles\nof experience of the whole vegetable kingdom through the gr o s s\nworld, on the earth and in the waters.\nAlthough the most-last species of vegetable-form is shed by the\nconscious soul and the soul is now without any form, yet the con-\nsciousness evolved is there, and through this consciousness the\nsoul (though without form) is conscious of the impressions of the\nmost-last species of the vegetable-form just shed.\nThese impressions must necessarily be spent or exhausted.\nIn order to experience these impressions the consciousness of\nthe soul now associates with an appropriate medium to experience\nthese impressions of the most-last species of the vegetable-for m .\nT h e re f o re, the consciousness of the soul thus tends the soul to\nidentify itself with the most-ﬁrst species of the worm - f o rm. It must\nbe re m e m b e red that this form of the most-first species of wor m -\nform is nothing other than the consolidated mould of the impres-\nsions of the most-last species of vegetable-form.\n18 God Speaks\n\nWhile the conscious soul thus identiﬁes itself with this most-\nfirst species of wor m - f o rm, the soul realizes that it is actually a\nworm and becomes worm-conscious.\nDespite all of the consciousness so far evolved, the soul is still\nnot conscious of its reality, its original, inﬁnite, eternal state, eter-\nnally in the Over-Soul. Although the soul is eternally in the Over-\nSoul and is inﬁnite and without form, this partially conscious soul\nactually experiences itself as a worm in the gross world. This is\nignorance. This ignorance persists as long as the consciousness of\nthe soul is not fully evolved, but even when the soul has come to\nfull consciousness, it is still said to be enveloped by ignorance be-\ncause this fully evolved consciousness does not make the soul Self-\nconscious instantaneously . On the contrary , when the consciousness\nof the soul is fully evolved the soul begins to identify itself as a\nhuman being.\nWhile the consciousness of the soul associates itself with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm it experiences and exhausts the im-\np ressions of the most-last species of the vegetable-form. When all\nthe impressions of the most-last species of vegetable-form are com-\npletely exhausted or spent through the diverse experiences had by\nthe soul while identiﬁed with the most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm ,\nthen this most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm is dropped or dissociated\nand the soul is once again without any form although it is conscious\nof the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm .\nThese impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm must\nbe experienced and exhausted. Therefore the consciousness of the\nsoul associates itself with another appropriate medium and tends\nthe soul to identify with the most-next species of worm - f o rm. This\nmedium of the most-next species of wor m - f o rm is nothing other\nthan the consolidated mould of the impressions of the most-ﬁ r s t\nspecies of worm-form.\nSpecies after species of wor m - f o rm are thus moulded and\nd ropped while the consciousness of the soul rapidly evolves thro u g h\nexperiencing the varied impressions of worm - f o rms through diverse\nspecies of worm - f o rm s .\nWhen the conscious soul is worm-conscious and experiences\nitself as a worm in the gross world, the consciousness of the soul\nInitial Urge 19\n\nalso has for the ﬁrst time the experience of voluntary movement,\nand also experiences that it is an animate cr e a t u re. This wor m -\nconscious soul in its travail to gain more and greater conscious-\nness also experiences itself in the gross world as an inver t e b r a t e ,\nand at a later stage in other states of vertebrate, limbless, cre e p i n g\nw o rm - f o rms of diverse species. In other diverse species of wor m -\nf o rm the consciousness of the soul undergoes further varied expe-\nriences of voluntary movement through crawling, through pairs\nof legs and sometimes through multiple pairs of legs, and somet i m e s\nt h rough pairs of legs and pairs of wings. Sometimes the wor m -\nconscious soul in varied species of wor m - f o rm realizes itself as\np o ssessing a hairy surface, sometimes a smooth and silky and some-\ntimes a rough or scaly surface (hide). The worm-conscious soul also\nrealizes more acutely that it has to struggle for its sustenance and\nalso for its survival, and that it is endowed with sensation and life.\nThis worm-conscious soul, with further evolution of con-\nsciousness through greater and varied innumerable experiences\nof varied and multiple impressions of varied species of worm - f o rm ,\nalso experiences and realizes that it is an amphibian—that it has\nnot only voluntary movement on earth but also freedom and mo-\nbility in water.\nFor our own convenience in understanding the evolution of con-\nsciousness more clearly , we include in the worm - f o rm the varied\nspecies of worms, varied species of insects, varied species of r e p-\ntiles and varied species of amphibia. In short, we include in the\nw o rm - f o rm all species that tend to crawl or that crawl in spite of\nh a ving limbs, legs and wings, or that are otherwise distinct fr o m\nb i rds and quadru p e d s .\nThe stone- and metal-forms had no upright or erect stand.\nThey were recumbent forms. Their posture was ﬂat and horizontal.\nThe vegetable-form had an upright, erect stand. Now the wor m -\nform is again of the recumbent type of form which has no upright\nor erect stand but is prone to have a prostrate posture.\nWhen the consciousness of the soul associates itself with the\nmost-last species of worm - f o rm after experiencing all the impre s-\nsions of the varied species of worm-form, and when the conscious\nsoul eventually drops or sheds this most-last species of worm - f o rm\n20 God Speaks\n\nafter ages and cycles of multiple diverse experiences in the gr o s s\nworld, the conscious soul again ﬁnds itself without any association\nor identiﬁcation with forms. But the consciousness of the soul is now\nc e n t red in the impressions of the most-last species of worm - f o rm just\nshed. These impressions must necessarily be exhausted thr o u g h\nexperience, and to get experience a suitable medium is necessary .\nT h e re f o re the consciousness of the soul, being centred in the\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of worm - f o rm, associates with\nan appropriate medium and tends the soul to identify itself with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of ﬁs h - f o rm in order to experience and exhaust\nthe impressions of the most-last species of worm-form. This most-\nfirst species of fish-form is nothing other than the consolidated\nmould of the impressions of the most-last species of worm-form.\nAs soon as the impressions of the most-last species of the worm -\nf o rm are exhausted through experiences, the most-ﬁrst species of\nﬁs h - f o rm is dropped or shed because the consciousness of the soul\ndissociates from this most-ﬁrst species and the conscious soul no\nlonger identiﬁes itself with that species.\nAlthough the conscious soul is now once again temporarily\nwithout form, yet the consciousness of the soul is centred in the im-\np ressions of the most-ﬁrst species of ﬁs h - f o rm .\nIn order to experience these impressions of the most-ﬁrst species\nof fish-form, the consciousness of the soul associates itself with\na suitable medium and tends the conscious soul to identify itself\nas the most-next species of ﬁs h - f o rm. This species is nothing but\nthe consolidated mould of the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species\nof ﬁs h - f o rm .\nAfter ages and cycles, and after innumerable varied impre s s i o n s\nof diverse species of ﬁs h - f o rms are experienced and exhausted, the\nconsciousness of the soul eventually associates itself with the most-\nlast species of ﬁsh-form in order to experience and exhaust all the\nimpressions of the most-last but one species of ﬁsh-form.\nThus the ﬁsh-conscious soul, identifying with varied species of\nthe ﬁs h - f o rm, experiences in the gross world that it is a living cre a-\nt u re in water; a vertebrate endowed with life, sensation and vol-\nu n t a ry motion; an animate cr e a t u re with limbs (if any) modiﬁ e d\ninto ﬁns; and that it has to struggle for sustenance and for surv i v a l .\nInitial Urge 21\n\nThe ﬁsh-conscious soul does not experience an upright, erect stand\nbut it experiences itself as a recumbent that can never hold its head\nhigh and erect and assert an upright stand in the gross world.\nThe ﬁsh-conscious soul eventually sheds or drops its identity\nwith the most-last species of fish-form as soon as the conscious-\nness of the soul has experienced and exhausted all the impre s s i o n s\nof the most-last but one species of ﬁ s h - f o rm. Thus the conscious\nsoul once again ﬁnds itself without identiﬁcation with any for m .\nBut the consciousness of the soul is conscious of impressions of\nthe most-last species of ﬁs h - f o rm .\nThese impressions of the most-last species of ﬁs h - f o rm must be\nexperienced and exhausted, and there f o re the consciousness of the\nsoul now associates with another suitable medium and thus tends\nthe soul to identify itself with the most-ﬁrst species of bir d - f o rm ,\nwhich is but the consolidated mould of the impressions of the\nmost-last species of ﬁsh-form.\nIn the most-ﬁrst species of bird-form the consciousness of the\nsoul experiences and exhausts the impressions of the most-last\nspecies of ﬁsh-form.\nWhen all the impressions are thus exhausted the conscious-\nness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-ﬁrst species of bird -\nf o rm, and the conscious soul dr o ps or sheds its identity with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of bird - f o rm (i . e . ,the most-ﬁrst species of bird -\nform is dropped).\nThe conscious soul is once again without form but it has con-\nsciousness centred in the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of\nbird-form just dropped.\nThese impressions must be experienced and exhausted, and\nt h e re f o re the consciousness of the soul automatically associates\nitself with the most-next species of bir d - f o rm and tends the con-\nscious soul to identify itself with the most-next species of bird - f o rm ,\nwhich species is but the consolidated mould of the impressions of\nthe most-ﬁrst species of bird - f o rm .\nOn and on, ages after ages and cycles after cycles, this chain\nof successive associations and dissociations with varied species of\na particular form moves onwards steadily and pr o g re s s i v e l y, and\ngives out innumerable diff e rent impressions to be experienced by\n22 God Speaks\n\nthe conscious soul. Directly and indire c t l y, these associations and\ndissociations of the consciousness of the soul are absolutely es-\nsential to keep the wheel of evolution of consciousness revolving.\nThe evolution of gross forms is but a by-product in the universal\nfactory of evolution of consciousness.\nThe bird-conscious soul identiﬁes with one species, then with\nthe next, and then the next species of bir d - f o rm, one after the\no t h e r, in regular succession until all the species of bird - f o rm are as-\nsociated and dissociated alternately by the consciousness of the\nsoul while experiencing multifarious impressions in the gr o s s\nworld, and thus the evolved consciousness of the conscious soul\ntends the soul to realize itself as bird in every species of the bir d -\nf o rm. Though the soul is eternally without form and in the Over-\nSoul, yet the bird-conscious soul consistently realizes that it is no\nother than a bird in the gross world experiencing bird impressions\non earth, on water and in air. It realizes itself as a feathered vert e-\nbrate capable of ﬂying in air, and with the help of two legs it main-\ntains an erect stand.\nE v e n t u a l l y, after ages and cycles of experiences of varied species\no f b i rd - f o rm , t h e b i rd - c o n s c i o u s s o u l s h e d s o r d ro p s t h e m o s t -\nlast species of bird - f o rm as soon as the consciousness of the soul\ndissociates itself from the most-last species of bir d - f o rm; and the\nconsciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-last\nspecies of bird - f o rm as soon as the consciousness experiences and\nfully exhausts all the impressions of the most-last but one species of\nb i rd - f o rm in the most-last species of bird - f o rm .\nAgain the conscious soul experiences itself as being without\nany form for the time being although the consciousness, evolved\nf u rther and gre a t e r, is always there. (Once consciousness is achieved\nby the soul, this consciousness goes on evolving more and more\nand can never be lost or devolved.) This consciousness of the soul\nwithout form now gets centralized in the impressions of the most-\nlast species of bird - f o rm just dropped. These impressions must nec-\nessarily be spent or exhausted by the consciousness of the soul.\nT h e re f o re consciousness associates itself with a suitable medium\nand thus tends the conscious soul to identify itself with the most-\nfirst species of animal-form. Through this most-first species of\nInitial Urge 23\n\na n i m a l - f o rm the consciousness of the soul experiences the im-\np ressions of the most-last species of bird - f o rm that was dropped or\nf rom which it was dissociated. This most-first species of animal-\nform is nothing other than the consolidated mould of the impres-\nsions of the most-last species of bird-form shed.\nAfter innumerable and diverse experiences of the impre s s i o n s\nof the most-last species of bird - f o rm through the form of the most-\nfirst species of animal-form, the consciousness of the soul com-\npletely exhausts the impressions of the most-last species of bir d -\nf o rm and then automatically dissociates itself from identiﬁ c a t i o n\nwith the most-ﬁrst species of animal-form. In this manner the form\nof that species is shed by the conscious soul, or the form of that\nspecies is said to have dropped or died.\nAgain, the conscious soul, with greater evolved consciousness,\nﬁnds itself without a form, although the consciousness of the soul is\nc e n t red  in the impressions of the form (just discarded or dro p p e d )\nof the most-ﬁrst species of animal-form .\nThese impressions of the form (just dropped) of the most-ﬁrst\nspecies of animal-form must be experienced or exhausted by the\nconsciousness of the soul, so that the conscious soul should not be\na w a re of any impressions of any form, but be conscious only of the\nreality of its own inﬁnite, eternal state, without forms or impr e s-\nsions, and through knowledge experience the Over-Soul. Thro u g h-\nout the travail of the soul to gain that consciousness for itself which\nwould make it realize the reality of its Self, the conscious soul goes\non and on in an apparently unending chain with its consciousness\nendeavoring ceaselessly to experience and exhaust all impressions\nthat centralize the consciousness of the soul, deviating this con-\nsciousness from the reality of the eternal and inﬁnite state of the\nSelf (eternally in the Over-Soul) to the consciousness of duality\nof illusion of the gross world. Thus the consciousness of the soul,\nin an eff o rt to gain consciousness of the reality of the Self, is con-\nsistently shrouded in an envelope of ignorance.\nT h e re f o re, in order that the consciousness of the soul should\nexperience and thus exhaust the impressions of the most-first\nspecies of animal-form, the consciousness of the soul now associ-\nates automatically with an appropriate medium which will permit\n24 God Speaks\n\nand aid it to experience the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of\na n i m a l - f o rm. This association of the consciousness of the soul per-\nforce tends the conscious soul to identify itself with the most-next\nspecies of animal-form. This most-next species of animal-form is\nno other than the consolidated mould of the impressions of the\nmost-ﬁrst species of animal-form.\nAs soon as the impressions are experienced and exhausted\nt h rough the most-next species of animal-form, this species is\nd ropped by the conscious soul. The soul once again experiences\nthat it is not identiﬁed with any gross form of the gross world.\nWhen the animal-conscious soul is without any form the con-\nsciousness of the soul is centred in the impressions of the most-\nnext species of animal-form just dropped or shed.\nThese impressions must also be experienced in order that they\nmay be exhausted, and therefore the consciousness of the soul au-\ntomatically associates itself with another medium and this perf o rc e\ntends the conscious soul to identify itself with the most-next to the\nnext species of animal-form.\nAfter ages and cycles of varied and innumerable associations\nwith and dissociations from diverse species of animal-form, the con-\nsciousness of the soul eventually associates itself with that medium\nwhich tends the conscious soul to identify itself as being the most-\nlast of the last species of animal-form .\nAll throughout the experiences of the animal-conscious soul,\nthe soul identified itself (through its consciousness) with varied\nspecies of animals in the gross world in water, on earth and below\nthe surface of the earth, and realized the experiences of an animate\nc re a t u re, usually as a quadru p e d a l - o rganized being, endowed with\nlife, sensation and voluntary motion, and which all the while had\nto struggle for sustenance and survival, sometimes as an herbivo-\nrous cre a t u re and sometimes as a carn i v o rous cre a t u re .The animal-\nf o rm has no erect or upright posture and has a tendency to look down\nwith drooping head. Apes, however, are the most evolved types of an-\nimals, and they tend to stand erect like human beings.\nU l t i m a t e l y, after ages and cycles, when all the impressions of the\nmost-last but one species of animal-form are experienced and ex-\nhausted through the medium of the most-last species of animal-f o rm ,\nInitial Urge 25\n\nthe consciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-last\nspecies of animal-form and the conscious soul no longer identiﬁe s\nitself with this most-last species of animal-form. This form is dis-\nsociated by the consciousness of the soul and is dropped or shed.\nH o w e v e r, though the most-last species of animal-form is dro p p e d\nor shed, the impressions of the most-last species of animal-form are\nleft or retained, and the consciousness of the soul is centralized or\nfocussed on the impressions of the most-last species of animal-form .\nThe conscious soul is once again without form .\nThese impressions must necessarily be experienced and ex-\nhausted, and hence the consciousness of the soul now associates\nitself with another suitable medium and the soul per f o rce tends\nto identify itself through its own consciousness with the most-\nfirst human-form. This human-form is no other than the consoli-\ndated mould or cast of the impressions of the most-last species o f\na n i m a l - f o rm .\nT h rough the most-ﬁrst human-form the consciousness of the soul\nexperiences and exhausts the impressions of the most-last species\nof animal-form .\nWhen all the impressions of the most-last species of the animal-\nf o rm are experienced and exhausted by the consciousness of the\nsoul, then the consciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the\nm o s t - ﬁrst human-form and the conscious soul automatically d ro p s\nor sheds the body association. This is called the death of the most-\nfirst human-form. But the consciousness of the soul is now focussed\nor centralized in the impressions of the most-ﬁrst human-form and\nthe soul is now temporarily without a form. \nIn order that the impressions of the most-first human-form\nmay be experienced and exhausted, the consciousness of the soul\nassociates itself with another appropriate medium, and the con-\nscious soul is thereupon inclined to identify itself with the most-\nnext human-form, which form is no other than the consolidated\nmould or cast of the impressions of the most-ﬁrst human-form just\nd ropped or shed. This identiﬁcation of the conscious soul with the\nnext form and those following is called the b i rth of a human being.\nAs soon as the consciousness of the soul associates with the\nmost-first human-form the EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS\n26 God Speaks\n\nFULL AND COMPLETE.* Because the consciousness 1 of\n the soul is\nfully developed in human-form, the evolution of form is also com-\nplete, and no new higher forms are now evolved once the con-\nscious soul identifies itself with the most-first human-form. In\ns h o rt, in human-form the consciousness of the soul is full and\ncomplete. The process of the evolution of consciousness is bro u g h t\nto a standstill. The human-form is the highest and the most sub-\nlime form evolved during the evolution of consciousness. Hence in\nthe human being consciousness is fully developed and the form\nmoulded and cast after ages and cycles is the most perfect form or\nmedium. The consciousness of the soul therefore utilizes this per-\nfect medium to experience and completely exhaust all impre s s i o n s\nso that the fully conscious soul becomes devoid of any impression\nwhatsoever, and thus is able to realize its own real, eternal and in-\nﬁnite state in the Over-Soul.\nInitial Urge 27\n* [Meher Baba maintains that such subjects should no longer be left indefinite,\nalthough he concedes that belief or non-belief in evolution and r e i n c a rn a t i o n\ndoes not in any way hasten or impede man’s spiritual pr o g ress. He tells us the\nspiritual significance of evolution and r e i n c a rnation in the following words: “It\nis the evolutionary struggle that enables the soul to develop full consciousness as\nthat in the human-form, and the purpose having been achieved, the side issues\nor by-products of evolutionary travel (the nuqush-e-amal or s a n s k a r a s) have to be\ndone away with, while retaining the consciousness intact. The process of re i n c a r-\nnation there f o re is to enable the soul to eliminate the sanskaras by passing thro u g h\nthe furnace of pain and pleasure.” Ed.]\n1.

    "text": "TO ACHIEVE complete development of consciousness in the human form, the evolutionary process had to take seven major leaps, viz., from stone to metal, from metal to vegetable, from vegetable to worm, from worm to fish, from fish to bird, from bird to animal and finally from animal to the human being, each possessing different characteristics.\n\nCharacteristics of the Kingdom of Stones and the Kingdom of Metals\n\nIn the stone-forms and metal-forms, the soul has its initial experiences of the gross world. The kingdom of metals, like the kingdom of stones, is inorganic and solid. Both kingdoms include within their range a rich variety of species. In the solid states of stones and metals, life and energy are dormant. Therefore they are regarded as inanimate. The stone-forms and metal-forms cannot move about by themselves, i.e., they have no voluntary motion. For this reason the consciousness, which associates itself with these forms, tends to assert itself through a recumbent, horizontal position rather than through an erect or upright stand in the gross world.\n\nCharacteristics of the Vegetable Kingdom\n\nIn the vegetable kingdom, consciousness realizes itself as half animate and half inanimate. The increased consciousness of the vegetable-form asserts its existence in the gross world through an upright or erect stand. The vegetable-forms have to take the help of some other things such as earth or rock for maintaining an erect position. They can neither stand by themselves nor move voluntarily from place to place since they are rooted in one spot.\n\nCharacteristics of the Kingdom of Worms\n\nIn worm-consciousness the soul gathers experiences of voluntary movement. It experiences itself as animate. In its travail to gain more and further consciousness, the worm-conscious soul experiences itself in the gross world, first as an invertebrate and later as a vertebrate, and goes on creeping in diverse species of worms. Voluntary movements are made by crawling by means of pairs of legs, sometimes by multiple pairs of legs, and sometimes by pairs of legs and pairs of wings. Worms may have surfaces that are hairy, smooth, silky, rough or scaly. The worm goes through a struggle for existence and survival and is endowed with sensation and life. Sometimes it is an amphibian, i.e., it has not only voluntary movement on earth, but has also mobility in water. For the purpose of this explanation, the worm-form includes all worms, insects, reptiles and amphibia of their species. Even when they have legs and wings, they have a tendency to crawl and they are distinct from birds and from quadruped animals. The worm-form is recumbent, has no upright or erect stand and is prone to lie prostrate.\n\nCharacteristics of the Kingdom of Fish\n\nThe fish-conscious soul identifies itself with varied species of fish and experiences the gross world as a living creature in water, a vertebrate endowed with life, sensation and voluntary motion, and has fins. It goes through a struggle for sustenance and survival. The fish-conscious soul does not assert its existence in the gross world through an erect stand, but experiences itself as recumbent, never holding its head high and erect.\n\nCharacteristics of the Kingdom of Birds\n\nThe bird-form enriches consciousness with new experiences since, as a feathered vertebrate, it is capable of flying in the air and, with the help of its two legs, of maintaining an erect stand in the gross world.\n\nCharacteristics of the Kingdom of Animals\n\nThe animal-form brings to consciousness further expansion, since it can yield new experiences through the greater varieties existing in the kingdom of animals. Endowed with life, sensation and power of voluntary locomotion, quadruped animals have to face a struggle for existence and survival. They are sometimes herbivorous and sometimes carnivorous. Animal consciousness does not assert its existence in the gross world through erect or upright posture, but has a tendency to look downwards with drooping head. Apes, however, are the most evolved type of animals, and they tend to stand erect like human beings.\n\nCharacteristics of the Kingdom of Human Beings\n\nIn the human-form the evolving consciousness of the soul attains its full development. The process of evolution of consciousness has its terminus in the human form. Here consciousness is full and complete. When a human being is born, it can only lie prostrate and it continues to experience this state for a fairly long period. But it soon expresses a tendency first to sit erect and then to stand erect. The fully evolved human consciousness of the soul eventually asserts its existence in the gross world through an upright position.",

    "text": "DURING the course of evolution of its consciousness, the soul (atma), while consciously identifying itself with varied, finite gross forms, was also simultaneously, though unconsciously, identifying itself with its finite subtle form and its finite mental form, which associated with the soul in compact, homogeneous, unconscious alliance throughout the entire course of evolution of consciousness right from the first urge. From the unconscious state of the soul (comparable to the deep-sleep state of man), until it has gained full gross consciousness (comparable to the wide-open eyes of man in the awake state) while experiencing the gross world, the soul is One—indivisible, infinite, formless—and is eternally in the Over-Soul.\n\nThroughout the whole process of evolution, reincarnation was an absolutely spontaneous outcome of the first urge, manifested in the unconscious soul, to become conscious of its eternal and infinite Self. As has been mentioned already, we can now understand that the cycle of evolution of consciousness of soul evolved further and greater consciousness, together with the evolution of forms of higher and higher types, while exhausting the impressions of the dissociated forms of lower types.\n\nThus the evolution of consciousness of soul apparently causes the soul to identify itself with, and gather varied innumerable impressions of, higher and higher gross species of forms of the gross world. The clean-cut and major concrete gross forms (after the most-first seven major, most abstract gaseous and fluid forms) with which the consciousness of the soul associated are separated by the seven leaps from stone to metal, from metal to vegetable, from vegetable to worm, from worm to fish, from fish to bird, from bird to animal and lastly from animal to human being.\n\nThe most-finite first impression of the first urge gave to the unconscious soul the most-finite first consciousness. Gradually, varied impressions gained greater finite consciousness for the soul, and eventually the evolution of consciousness was complete when the soul identified itself with the first human-form. In human-form the soul achieves full and complete consciousness. Therefore the soul, having now gained full and complete consciousness in human-form, does not need any more or any other higher forms to evolve consciousness.\n\nThough the soul has gained full and complete consciousness, it is still not conscious of its Self as One, indivisible, eternal and infinite, and does not experience infinite knowledge, power and bliss. It is fully conscious only of its identity with the human-form and experiences the gross world in full. Because of the burden of gross impressions of the human-form, the consciousness of the soul dissociates from that form at death, but the impressions cling to consciousness.\n\nIn trying to unburden itself of these impressions, the soul undergoes innumerable reincarnations, experiencing opposite impressions through varied human-forms. The attempt to balance impressions is constantly disturbed by fresh associations with new human-forms. Thus equilibrium is approached but missed. Heaven and hell are states in which predominant impressions are experienced subjectively in the absence of the gross body, yet even here complete impressionless equipoise is not attained.\n\nResidual impressions compel further association with gross forms, sustaining an unending chain of births and deaths until consciousness succeeds in establishing complete impressionless equipoise. Through countless reincarnations, impressions are experienced, counterbalanced and thinned out, leading ultimately to emancipation from ignorance and realization of Self-consciousness.\n\nThroughout reincarnation the soul never dissociates from its subtle and mental bodies. These bodies evolve simultaneously with gross evolution, fortifying consciousness with energy and retaining impressions. In lower forms instinct gradually develops, and in the human-form instinct transforms into intellect. Thus only in the human-form are gross, subtle and mental bodies fully developed.\n\nAlthough the gross-conscious human soul experiences only the gross world, it indirectly uses the subtle and mental bodies. After death, impressions retained in subtle and mental bodies lead the soul through heaven or hell before rebirth. Birth is the association of the soul with a new human-form moulded from residual impressions.\n\nThus the reincarnation process is the continuous play of association and dissociation of consciousness with gross forms, sustained by impressions, until consciousness ultimately attains impressionless equipoise and realizes the infinite, eternal state of the Self.",

Out of the Nothing, seven states of gas\ncame into being. The seventh evolved state is hydrogen. Out of this seventh gaseous\nstate evolution and production came into being.\nC reation can be reconciled with evolution because all is in seven stages: seven\nstages of production, seven stages of evolution, and seven stages of involution.\nSo, it is said that God created the universe in seven days. From the Nothing, most\nﬁnite shadow and inﬁnite shadow emerged simultaneously.\nthe all-p e rvading inﬁnite trio- n a t u re of God—gradually expands\nad infinitum and manifests apparently as infinite Nothingness or\nas inﬁnite Creation.\nThe Whim or Lahar\nThe cause which led the most ﬁnite Nothing, latent in the in-\nﬁnite Everything, to manifest itself as inﬁnite Nothingness, is the\noriginal cause called the “CAUSE.”\nThis Cause is just nothing but the WHIM or lahar of God. This\noriginal whim can also be called the ﬁrst “WORD” u t t e red by God—\n“WHO AM I?”\nThe inﬁnitude of the God-Is state made God absolutely inde-\npendent, and by virtue of being absolutely independent it is but\nnatural for God to exercise His infinite whim to experience and\nenjoy His own infinity.

A whim\nmay come at any moment; it may come now or after a few months\nor after years, and it may not come at all.\nS i m i l a r l y, the original infinite whim, after all, is a whim, and\ntoo, it is the whim of God in the state of infinitude!

Hence this whim, which once surged, once began the Begin-\nning of all things in Creation.\nIn short, this original inﬁnite latent whim of God in the state of\ni n ﬁnitude, once it surged in God Who is absolutely independent,\nmade itself manifest, and simultaneously with its manifestation,\nit manifested the latent-all that was of the Nothing as Nothingness.\nThus the whim created the Nothing.\nLet us recapitulate how inﬁnite Nothing came out of most ﬁn i t e\nE v e ry t h i n g :\nGod Beyond is inﬁnite Everything.

It remains eter n a l l y, re g a rdless of whether that\nconsciousness fully gained is the consciousness of the false Noth-\ningness experienced as real, or whether that consciousness is the\nconsciousness of Reality Itself.\nEventually consciousness does make God realize His own re-\nality after that same consciousness has attained complete maturity .\nConsciousness is fully matured to realize Reality only after it is nur-\nt u red by the apparent awareness of the false. This awareness of the\nfalse as real becomes so intensiﬁed during the course of the evo-\nlution of consciousness, that the consciousness, steeped in false\na w a reness, makes God aware only of the false, which is experi-\nenced by God as the real. That is, God as Creator falsely experiences\nthe manifestation of the Nothing as real and Everything.\nIn order that the latent consciousness of God in the God-Is\nstate should make it possible for God to realize His own eternal re-\na l i t y, the projection of that latent consciousness in Ever y t h i n g\n(which, when projected outwards, becomes focussed on the false\ninfinity of Nothingness) should be withdrawn inwar d l y. By such\nan i n w a rd withdrawal, the focus of the same consciousness becomes\n80 God Speaks\ncentred on the inﬁnity of Everything (from which it had projected\no u t w a rds and given rise to the experience of inﬁnite Nothingness\nrather than the experience of the inﬁnity of Everything).\nAs said before, when the projected consciousness withdraws\ninwards or undergoes full and complete involution, that Nothing-\nness which was once experienced as reality automatically vanishes\nfor the consciousness which is now focussed completely on the\neternal Reality of the inﬁnitude of God.\nIn short, there is no n e wconsciousness to be attained to re a l-\nize Reality—the Eternal. It is the same consciousness latent in the\nE v e rything which, when it emerges out of the Nothing, ﬁrst gradu-\nally evolves and, associating with the Nothingness, then experiences\nthe Nothingness as real. When the evolution of this consciousness\nis complete and full, the same consciousness makes God experi-\nence the false Nothingness which expands ad inﬁnitum as real and\ninfinite. Again, when the same full and complete consciousness\nreaches full and complete maturity through its own involution, it\nrealizes infinite Reality as the only reality and gives God the ex-\nperience of His own real and eternal inﬁnite state.\nGod in His original state of infinitude is eternally infinite\nt h rough His inﬁnite, unbounded and unlimited trio- n a t u re of in-\nﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss. As God etern a l l y\nIs, the only virtual diff e rence between the original state of God a n d\nthe new states of God that He acquires is that of the conscious-\nness gained pro g ressively through the i m p ressions of the pro j e c t e d\nNothingness.\nGod in His original state of God-Is is not conscious of His in-\nﬁnite eternal existence nor of His own inﬁnite nature though He\nexists inﬁnitely and eter n a l l y. Due to His own inﬁnite whim God\na c q u i res the consciousness of His reality and realizes His inﬁn i t e ,\ne t e rnal unlimited Self to experience His unbounded, unlimited and\ninﬁnite trio-nature.\nThus God, now with His newly acquired state of eternal con-\nsciousness, is consciously and eternally aware of His original Be-\nyond the Beyond state of God-Is, which is for ever and ever\nunconscious of the inﬁnitude of His own God-Is state.

In this state man experi-\nences that his nature is not the finite body (typifying happiness)\nbut is inﬁnite bliss; not the ﬁnite energy but inﬁnite power; not the\nfinite mind but infinite knowledge. Thus man loses his basic fi-\nnite triple nature and realizes that his is the basic infinite trio-\nn a t u re of God. This means that the basic ﬁnite triple nature of man,\nwhich was upheld by the basic inﬁnite trio- n a t u re of God, is un-\nlinked from the basic inﬁnite trio-nature of God.\nAlthough the man loses his basic finite triple nature, the full\nconsciousness that he gained in his travail is not lost, because full\nconsciousness once gained is never lost, except in gross misuse of\nthe powers of the fourth plane, as previously described.\nIn this state, with consciousness intact and complete, the lim-\nited and ﬁnite body (typifying happiness), the limited and ﬁnite en-\ne rg y, and the limited and ﬁnite mind are all totally unlinked fro m\nthe unlimited and inﬁnite bliss, power and knowledge re s p e c t i v e l y.\nThis is the stage when man is fully conscious and yet no longer\nexperiences the false finite Nothingness as real and infinite. The\nbody (typifying happiness), energy and mind, which were instru-\nmental in giving the experience of the Nothingness, no longer grip\nthe consciousness of man with ﬁnite impressions. These are now\nunlinked and have simply vanished from the focus of the con-\nsciousness. They must vanish because they were of the ﬁnite Noth-\ning by nature, which literally means absolutely nothing.\nBut before body , energy and mind ultimately lose their grip\nover the consciousness of man, there is one predominant experi-\nence which he has in his everyday life, that of sleeping and waking\neach day .\nThis fundamental experience in a normal man gives rise to\nthree basic states in his everyday life:\nThe ﬁrst state is the sound sleep state or the state of complete\nunconsciousness of the Self in man.\nThe second state is the dream state or the semi-conscious or semi-\nawake state.\n86 God Speaks\nThe third state is the completely awake state or the state of com-\nplete consciousness of the Self in man as man.\nN o w, man’s cognizance is life in man, and man’s life is m a d e\ncognizant through the a c t i o n sof man. Actions are generated by the\ni m p ressions of man and vice-versa. These impressions of man are\npicked up and imprinted on the mind of man by actions. Impre s-\nsions and actions are thus interdependent because impressions are\nfed by actions and actions are motivated by impressions.\nAs said pre v i o u s l y, the source of impressions is traced as far\nback as the latent Nothing in the Everything, which means God\nin the God-Is state. When the Nothing ﬁrst became manifested as\nNothingness in the shape of Creation, the primal manifestation\nof the Nothing gave rise to the ﬁrst trace of consciousness in God\nand hereupon the first impression of Nothingness manifested.\nThis first impression pr o c reated impressions with the evolution\nof consciousness.\nA c c o rd i n g l y, all impressions are of the Nothing, and as Nothing\nliterally means nothing, these impressions are naturally nothing\nbut mere impressions. But, because it was through these very im-\np ressions of Nothing that consciousness evolved fully and com-\npletely in man, the consciousness of man is closely linked with\nthese impressions of Nothing and makes man consciously expe-\nrience this false Nothing as Everything and real.\nI m p ressions as such play a vital role in the life of man until\nsuch time as they are completely wiped away , relieving and fr e e-\ning consciousness from experiencing the false Nothing as Every-\nthing and real. Consciousness, when relieved of all impr e s s i o n s ,\nwill no longer experience the false Nothing as real but it will ex-\nperience Reality as the unlimited Self (i.e., God).\nAs long as impressions persist and continue to impress the con-\nsciousness of man, these impressions, activated and generated by\nthe energy of man, are being constantly imprinted on the mind of\nman and are being retained or stored in his sub-consciousness.\nSome of these impressions remain dormant in the sub-\nconsciousness of man for hours, or days, or years, and sometimes\nfor lifetimes.

When God in the man state completely wakes up\ne v e ry day from His sound sleep state, the full consciousness which\nlay dormant during sound sleep and the multitude of impressions\nwhich had vanished (i.e., out of sight and out of experience) in the\nsound sleep are now all catapulted out to produce once again the\nfalse experiences of the ﬁnite Nothing manifesting as real and in-\nﬁnite Nothingness.\nThis unending chain of alternating absorption and ejection of\nconsciousness and impressions in the alternating sound sleep and\nawake states continues until ultimately all of the impressions are\nousted or wiped off clean through the experiencing of the opposite\ni m p ressions in the processes of r e i n c a rnation and involution of\nconsciousness. Thus impressionless consciousness alone re m a i n s\nto give God the conscious experience of His original, eternal, in-\nﬁnite, real God-state.\nAs God invariably gains full and unimpressioned consciousness\nthrough the human-form, the different states of man may be taken\nas examples with which to compare the different states of God.\nThe sound sleep state of God in the man state not only resem-\nbles the divine sound sleep state of God but is literally the same\noriginal divine sound sleep state of God in the Beyond the Beyond\nstate of God-Is where unbounded, absolute vacuum prevails.*\n94 God Speaks\n* There is a profound and very real relationship between God-realization and sound\nsleep. The eternal desire of the soul is to become one with God, but because con-\nsciousness attaches itself to the gross, the soul seems to become one merely with\nthe gross. In the stone state, for instance, gross consciousness makes the soul iden-\ntify itself with the stone although, in reality, the soul is all the time one with God.\nTo make this clearer, let us suppose that you take opium or an intoxicating drink.\nYou feel elated or depressed, although there is no radical change in your body, and\nit is only the consciousness that is affected and gives rise to your feelings. Thus you,\nas an individual soul, are twenty-four hours within and one-with God, although\nyou feel merely gross-conscious.\nAgain, let us suppose that you feel tired and fed up and that you go to sleep. What\nis it that you are trying to do? It is nothing but to try to take refuge in God—your\nnatural and inherent state. The whole Creation ther e f o re has this conscious or\nunconscious tendency to take shelter in God the Over-Soul by entering the state of\nsound sleep for a time.\n\nWhen man passes away in the sound sleep state, absolute vac-\nuum and no consciousness prevails, and though the “self” in man\ncontinues to breathe normally, yet in that “self” of man there is no\nconsciousness of its limited “I” or ego, nor is there consciousness\nof the limited mind, energ y, body or the world. The self in man is\nnot even conscious of its own being. In short, in the sound sleep\nstate of man the “self-is” and consciousness “is-not.”\nWhen a man wakes up daily from his sound sleep state he nor-\nmally just wakes up for no reason whatsoever except that his own\nd o rmant consciousness of impressions urges or excites his sub-\nconsciousness to eject out the consciousness, and experience the\nd o rmant impressions which apparently vanish in sound sleep.\nT h e re f o re, as soon as the man wakes up, he invariably and simul-\ntaneously gains consciousness at ﬁrst of his surroundings and gradu-\nally then of his own “self” with all of its paraphernalia of the limited\n“I,” the mind, energy , the body and the world.\nS i m i l a r l y, no rhyme, no reason and no cause other than the origi-\nnal, inﬁnite whim of the absolutely independent God was the ac-\ntual Cause—the original cause—for God in the original divine sound\nsleep state to wake up out of the unbounded, original vacuum.\nJust as a man, who wakes up from his sound sleep state,* has in-\nvariably to pass through the state of dreaming ﬁrst and then wake\nup completely , gaining full consciousness after the semi-c o n s c i o u s\nstate of the dream (which may last for a very long duration or may\nlast only for a split second), so, too, is it the case with God in the\nGod-Is state. Before completely waking up from His original divine\nsound sleep state, God necessarily experiences the divine semi-\nconscious state which is the divine dream state or the creator state.\nThe original, inﬁnite whim, as the Cause, manifested the ﬁ r s t\ntrickle of most-ﬁnite consciousness in God. This most-ﬁnite con-\nsciousness made God, now in a semi-conscious state, experience\nt h rough sub-consciousness the most-ﬁnite impression of the latent\nNothing which was also manifested as the Nothingness.

God in this way receives apparently real, but\nreally false, answers to His First Wo rd “Who am I?”—such as “I am\nstone,” “I am metal,” and so forth, and ﬁnally obtains the answers\n“I am man,” “I am woman.”\nWhen God identifies Himself with human beings, He is no\nlonger semi-conscious; because at this stage in the divine dr e a m\nstate, as soon as God identifies Himself with a human form He\ngains full consciousness.\nFull consciousness now having been gained, this consciousness\nought to dispel all dreams and cause God to experience the r e a l\nawake state, giving Him the realization that He is God.

For the man to commence \nexperiencing dreams means that in his initial stage of the semi-\nconscious state he begins to experience through his sub-\nconsciousness the dormant impressions of the Nothingness in\ns u b-subtle forms. The man now is not only in the initial stage of\nthe semi-conscious state and is not only beginning to experience\ndreams, but he is also starting to get involved in the dreams by be-\nginning to associate with the cr e a t u res in sub-subtle forms of his\nown creation. Thus the projection of impressions, which lay dor-\nmant in the sub-consciousness of man, makes man play the role of\nthe hero or the creator in the drama of his dreams. Because this\nman in this dream state has only just stirred from his sound sleep\nand has just attained the semi-conscious state, picture this man\ne xperiencing the dreams as one who is starting now to open his\neyes very , very slightly . The beginning of the opening of the eyes\nresembles the advent of the first trace of consciousness as sub-\nconsciousness manifested in man.\nWhile visualizing this state of man, as a parallel, picture likewise\nthat state of God in which He has just stirred from His original di-\nvine sound sleep state. God now only begins to experience the divine\nd ream state, or the Creator state, as soon as the first most- f i n i t e\ni mp ression of the Nothingness is projected through the divine sub-\nconsciousness of God. Both of these—i.e., the Nothingness and the\ndivine sub-consciousness of God—were latent as of Nothing in the\noriginal state of God as the Everything. God, now in the initial stage\nof the divine semi-conscious state, just begins to identify Himself\nwith the cre a t u res of His own Creation (i.e., His own divine dre a m )\nt h rough the inﬁnite divine sub-consciousness which just begins to\np roject the Creation, that is, the impressions of the Nothingness.\nThird Stage\nVisualize the third state of the man as still asleep, but with\nh a l f-open eyes, because a man in this state now completely expe-\nriences the semi-conscious state. In order to picture this complete\ns e m i-conscious state of the still-sleeping man, continue to visualize\nhim with eyes very , very slightly open, re p resenting the beginning\n100 God Speaks\nof the semi-conscious state. In this state, as said above, he starts to\nexperience dreams due to the false, illusory impressions of the\nNothingness which were collected sub-consciously and are now\nejected out through the projection of the sub-consciousness, giving\nrise to the beginning of the dream state of man. But, as the dre a m s\ncontinue, and as they gather momentum due to the intensity of the\np rojection of multifarious and varied dormant impressions thro u g h\nthe sub-consciousness of the man, he gets more and m o re involved\ns u b-c o n s c i o u s l y. As a result he now ﬁrmly associates himself with\nthe cre a t u res of his own creation in the dreams and he is completely\nin the semi-conscious state. This semi-conscious state of the man re p-\nresents that state which is neither the complete sound sleep state\nwithout consciousness nor the complete awake state with full con-\nsciousness. This state, so to speak, is the semi-awake state. Now visu-\nalize this third state of the man as the state of semi-consciousness\nre p resented by half-opened eyes experiencing the dreams more\nforcefully and much more intently.\nWhile visualizing this state of the man, picture as a parallel that\nstate of God in the divine dream state where God is experiencing\na semi-conscious state. At this stage, God as the creator of Cre a t i o n\nexperiences the creator state through the infinite, divine semi-\nconscious state. Here the inﬁnite divine sub-consciousness, inten-\nsively projecting Creation into being, continually af f i rms God’s\nidentification with the cr e a t u res of His own creation. This gives\nrise to inﬁnite experiences of a more forceful nature in the divine\nd ream of God, when God actually finds Himself as the cr e a t u re s\nof His Creation.\nFourth Stage\nVisualize the fourth state of the man as that in which he is still\nasleep but trying gradually to open wider his already half-opened\neyes in accordance with the greater and greater intensity of the pro-\njection of more and more impressions through the sub-consciousness\nof the man still in his dream state. Here the man is not only in a\nsemi-conscious state but is verging on being fully conscious, and is\nabout to realize his awake state.",

Compare the fourth state of the man\nin the semi-conscious state with a very critical stage in the divine\nd ream state of God. Here the projection of inﬁnite impr e s s i o n s ,\nt h rough the inﬁnite divine sub-consciousness of God, is so inten-\ns i ﬁed in the course of the cosmic evolution of the consciousness\nof God, that this projection is about to be so completely ﬁxed, or so\np e rfectly focussed, onto the inﬁnity of Nothingness as to identify\nGod with His own most perfect image in His divine dream of Cre-\nation. Thus at this stage in the divine dream state, God the Cre a t o r\nis about to identify Himself with a human form after innumerable\ni d e n t i ﬁcations with all and everything that is in His Creation in-\ncluding inanimate and animate objects. God, in the divine inﬁn i t e\ns e m i-conscious state, is now nearing the verge of gaining full con-\nsciousness concurrently with His identiﬁcation with human form .\nFifth Stage\nVisualize the ﬁfth state of the man as being still asleep but with\neyes now almost open. The man in this state is still i nthe semi-\nconscious or semi-awake state, experiencing the dreams at their\nheight in their ﬁnal stage, in which the impressions are pro j e c t e d\nt h rough his sub-consciousness with the greatest intensity . The\nzenith is reached both by the intensiﬁed projection of the impres-\nsions in much less hazy forms, or in greater degree of realism, and\nby relevant dreams which are dreamt in a greater degree of clarity\nor in their ripe stage. This is the stage in dreams when the sub-\nsubtle forms of Nothingness have reached their zenith and appear\nm o re clearly . The dreams at their height now must stop, because\nthe zenith reached by the projections of impressions through the\ns u b-consciousness of the man is at this point sufﬁcient to excite and\nu rge the emergence or manifestation of full consciousness at any\nmoment. This state of the man almost fully conscious may there f o re\nbe pictured as a man with his eyes almost wide open, though still\nasleep. This is the stage reached a split second before the man has\nroused from his dream state to become wide awake.

With divine, inﬁ-\nnite sub-consciousness, God is in His divine, inﬁnite semi-conscious\nstate, which when almost matured i d e n t i ﬁed God with inﬁnite im-\np ressions of animal forms. But now in the ﬁfth stage of the divine\nd ream state where God is in the completely matured divine, inﬁn i t e\ns e m i-conscious state, God can no longer be made to identify with\ni m p ressions of animal forms even though they are intensively and\ni nﬁnitely projected through His divine, inﬁnite sub-consciousness.\nAt this point a stage is reached in the divine dream state where i n ,\nwith the projection to inﬁnity of impressions projected inﬁ n i t e l y\nt h rough the divine, inﬁnite sub-consciousness of God at its zenith,\nthis inﬁnite projection has almost identiﬁed God with a human form\nand God is almost fully conscious.\nSixth Stage\nVisualize the sixth state of the man as having completely awak-\nened from his sleep and as having his eyes completely wide open.\nIn this state the man is no longer in the semi-conscious state,\nd reaming the dreams which were nothing but the hazy and faint\np rojection of the dormant impressions of Nothingness which were\ns t o red in the sub-consciousness of the man, and realized thro u g h\nhis sub-consciousness in sub-subtle forms of Nothingness. This\nis the stage in the state of the man where he has just awakened\nc o m p l e t e l y, but albeit he is fully conscious, he is not conscious of\nhis “Self” as yet.

The man now in the\nawake state no longer experiences or sees the Nothingness as some-\nthing hazy or faint as he used to see it in his dream state. With his\neyes just opened wide and fully, he is dazed and stares vacantly\nat things that now confront his sight more r e a l i s t i c a l l y. The man\nnow observes things that confront his sight as if he were seeing the\nripe, the clear and the fully developed forms of the same Nothing-\nness that he saw in his dream as raw , hazy and faint. In this state\nthe man sees, as it were, yet another dream, but he sees it much\nm o re realistically than the dream from which he awakened a split\nsecond before.\nThis is the sixth stage in the state of man where the man, dazed,\nsimply experiences the sight of things much more realistically but\nstill as if it were just a vacant dream. That is, the man sees more\nf o rcefully and realistically but still vacantly the dream of his dre a m\nstate, giving him the sense of yet another dream within the dream\nof his dream state.\nThis state corresponds to the few seconds immediately after a\nman has awakened and cannot help but see at ﬁrst theobjects that\ncome within range of his vision rather than his own self. This is be-\ncause, as soon as his eyes open after the sleep state, the sponta-\nneous opening of the long-shut eyes creates in him a sort of dazed\nstate and, although the man has awakened and is fully conscious,\nhe is still unaware of his Self or of its position in relation to the ob-\njects surrounding his very self. He simply stares at the objects upon\nwhich his gaze falls.\nWhile visualizing the sixth state of the man, make a parallel\nof it by picturing in the same way that state of God as of that instant\nwhen God has just identiﬁed Himself with a human form and has\nj u s tgained full consciousness. At that moment God is no longer in\nthe divine, inﬁnite semi-conscious state, dreaming the original di-\nvine dream which was the projection of the latent Nothing re l e a s e d\nby the divine, infinite sub-consciousness as the Creation, or as\ncompletely evolved Nothingness.\nIn this sixth state, God is now out of His original, divine sound\nsleep and His divine, inﬁnite semi-conscious states because He is\n104 God Speaks\nnow fully conscious. Here God is conscious not of His unlimited\nSelf nor of His inﬁnite, unbounded and unlimited trio-n a t u re of in-\nﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss, but is just fully conscious. God\nis fully conscious now in the sense that God is consciously ab-\nsorbed in the Nothingness which now manifests through His full\nconsciousness as clear and well defined, realistic gross states ap-\nparently demonstrating their inﬁnite aspects ad inﬁnitum.\nSeventh Stage\nVisualize the seventh state of the man where he has his eyes\nwide open and is completely and fully awake in the sense that he\nnow asserts his limited self or ego, and is conscious of his human\nf o rm or the gross body , of his surroundings and of the gross world.\nThough this man is fully conscious and completely aware of the\ng ross, and experiences the gross world in full, yet he is still un-\nconscious of the limited energy and mind of which he indir e c t l y\nmakes unconscious use, being aware of their aspects through the\nlimitations of his gross body alone. In this state the man is fully\nconscious, but gr o s s-c o n s c i o u s l y, and is fully aware of his self as\na man in the world of his surroundings.\nThe man is not only completely aware of the gross world, and\nof all things in the world which confront his view , but he also ac-\ntually experiences them by involving his fully conscious and fully\na w a re state of limited self in them. He now recognizes the objects\nof the gross world through his ﬁve predominant gross senses and\nd i ff e rentiates them one from another, using them discriminately or\nindiscriminately, automatically and indirectly utilizing energy and\nmind which are now fully developed, in attaching to them their\nrelative values as and when his limited self asserts in his awake\nstate before he passes away once again in sound sleep.*",

God now\nno longer dreams divinely the original divine dream but, with full\nconsciousness now completely gained, He experiences falsely the\ncomplete awareness. This awareness makes God falsely aware of\nthat original Nothing which was latent in His own state of inﬁ n i-\ntude, and which, with the present gain of full consciousness, makes\nGod experience that Nothing realistically as the Everything, inﬁ-\nnite and real. In other words, God, when He was in the divine, in-\nfinite semi-conscious state, was experiencing the latent Nothing\nmanifested as the Nothingness as His divine dream. Now , when\nGod is in a fully conscious state, He apparently experiences that\nNothing, not as the divine dream of Nothingness, but He now ac-\ntually experiences the awareness of this Nothing as the Every t h i n g .\nIn this stage with the advent of awareness, although God in the\nstate of creator has stopped dreaming divinely the original divine\nd ream, yet, because of His having gained full consciousness and\ncomplete awareness, God now becomes completely aware of the\noriginal divine dream not as a dream but as something realistic, not\nas illusion but as reality, not as the Nothing but as the Everything,\np re s e rving the Nothing that He created. Thus it is that, although\nGod gained full consciousness and experienced complete aware-\nness in the state of creator, this very awareness of God the Creator\np roves a deception and makes God now experience His own divine\nd ream (or the Creation) of the Nothing as Reality while He iden-\ntiﬁes Himself with the human being.\nIn short, God the Creator as the God-i n-man, though now fully\nconscious and completely aware and out of His original divine\nd ream state, yet ﬁnds Himself not as God but as man with complete\ng ross consciousness, experiencing the creation of His own original\ndivine dream state as Reality . Here it is to be said that the God-in-\nman continues to experience in the awake state with the aware n e s s\nof false reality the vacant divine dream as yet another dream ofG o d\nwithin that original divine dream.\nThis is the most alluring stage in the state of God when, with\nfull consciousness gained, God is led astray , by the false awareness  \n106 God Speaks\nattained, to identify Himself not with His unlimited and inﬁnite Self,\nbut with His most perfect image in the shape of the human being,\nwhile God continues to experience the vacant divine dre a m .\nAlthough it appears as the most fantastic imagination, yet it is\na fact that the very life of man is the veil that shrouds the r e a l i t y\nof the eternal existence of God.\nIt is the irony of divine fate that God gets lost in man to find\nHimself, and the instant that man gets lost in God, God realizes His\nReality as Existence, eternal and inﬁnite.\nIn other words, inﬁnite God becomes inﬁnitely absorbed in His\nown inﬁnitely perfect image intently seeking His inﬁnity; and al-\nthough God does gain full consciousness through it, He does not re-\nalize the reality of His own eternal, inﬁnite existence in it. But, the\ninstant the full consciousness thus gained ceases to identify God\nwith the inﬁnite re ﬂection of His inﬁnitely perfect image, this image\nvanishes from the consciousness of God, and God spontaneously\nand automatically and consciously realizes His own identity as God,\nthe inﬁnite Existence, and ﬁnds that He alone ever was, always is\nand eternally will remain the Only Reality .\nThus God in the man state, at ﬁrst realizing Himself as man, as-\ns e rted His limited aspects through the limited self or the limited\nego, the limited mind, the limited energy and the ﬁnite gross body .\nThen eventually and ultimately realizing Himself as God, He mani-\nfests His unlimited, unbounded, infinite trio- n a t u re of infinite\nknowledge, inﬁnite power and inﬁnite bliss through His divine un-\nlimited Self.\nWhile depicting, through the seven diff e rent primary stages, the\np rocess of unfoldment of the latent consciousness of God in His\noriginal, unconscious, divine sound sleep state, as compared with\nthe seven diff e rent primary states of man gaining consciousness\nright from his unconscious sound sleep state to the state where i n\nhe gains full consciousness and wakes up completely with wide-\nopen eyes, it is found that this is the process of the evolution of\nconsciousness of God which eventually identifies the fully con-\nscious God with the fully conscious man, after identifying God\nwith all and everything inanimate and animate in the drama of the\ndivine dream of Creation.18",

This unawareness is due to the unwanted (though\nn e c e s s a ry) burden of the gross impressions still clinging to the full\nconsciousness gained.\nThe process through which God in the man state struggles to\nu n b u rden these ﬁnite impressions is one which takes place thro u g h\nopposite impressions, and is called the process of reincarnation.19\nIn\n trying to unburden consciousness from the finite impr e s -\nsions the gross consciousness of God necessarily has to experience\nthese impressions and then exhaust them by innumerable opposite\nexperiences through a series of reincarnations.

    "text": "In order to understand the involution of consciousness in the\nmental sphere more clearly it is necessary to understand that the\nmental sphere of the fifth and sixth planes of consciousness is\nthe domain of the Mind. This Mind of the mental planes has two\nsections.\nIn the ﬁrst section the state of Mind is inquiring or re ﬂe c t i n g .\nIn this state Mind functions as Thoughts—high thoughts, low\nthoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, material thoughts, spiritual\nthoughts and thoughts of every kind, type and state.\nIn the second section the state of Mind is impressive or sympa-\nthetic. In this state Mind functions as Feelings—feelings of suff e r i n g s\nand emotions, feelings of desires and longings, feelings of pangs of\nseparation and feelings of every kind and type and state.\nSince Mind of the mental sphere has distinct dual functions,\nit is inevitable that the experiences in the ﬁeld of Mind (i . e . ,the men-\ntal sphere) must be distinctively of two kinds also.\nThus the mental sphere has two domains. There f o re the domain\nof the ﬁfth plane of consciousness is of thoughts, and the domain o f\nthe sixth plane of consciousness is of feelings.\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the consciousness of mental-conscious God in\nthe man state in the ﬁfth plane identiﬁes with the ﬁrst section of\nMind, which is inquiring or re ﬂecting Mind. There f o re, this mental-\nconscious God in the man state of the fifth plane is the cr e a t o r\nand master of thoughts, as He i s“Thoughts” personified, and is\na c c o rdingly capable of controlling only the thought section of all\nminds of all gro s s- and subtle-conscious states of God. This is often\nm i s i n t e r p reted as controlling the minds of all gross- and subtle-\nconscious states of God, but the fact is that God in the ﬁfth plane\nof consciousness does not control the mind as a whole, but contro l s\nonly that state of Mind which functions as thoughts.\nM e n t a l-conscious God in the man state in the fifth plane of\nconsciousness, while identifying Himself as inquiring or re f l e c t i n g\nMind emanating only thoughts, does not identify Himself with the\nsecond section of Mind and is ther e f o re still incapable of estab-\nlishing mastery over feelings (i.e., emotions and desires).",

He feels for, longs for and pangs for union with God\nWhom He at this stage feels seeing face to face.\nThis identiﬁcation with the second section of Mind (feelings)\nis the state of God in the man state where the predominant aspect\nof divine love, which eventually leads to union with God (i.e., re a l i-\nzation of the God state consciously), is manifested most forc e f u l l y.\nHence it should be clear that the ﬁfth plane of the mental sphere\nis the state of full consciousness of thoughts only . The mastery over\nc o n t rol and creation of thoughts alone is established, and t h e re is\nno mastery or control over feelings of desires and emotions. But the\nsixth plane of the mental sphere is the state of full consciousness\nof feelings, and thus the mastery over control and creation of feel-\nings is established and no more scope is now left for even a single\nthought to penetrate into the domain of feelings.\nThe sixth plane consciousness is thought-less and governs the\nfeelings of all of the gro s s- and subtle-conscious states of God. This\nis often misinterpreted as mastery over the h e a rts of all those in the\ng ro s s- and subtle-conscious states of God. He does not govern or\nregulate the so-called hearts but controls and governs that second\nsection of Mind in the mental sphere which emanates feelings of\nemotions and desires.\nThe loving of God and the longing for His union is really and\nfully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness. Only when\nthe sixth plane of the mental sphere is transcended, does Illusion\nvanish with the vanishing of the last trace of impressions, and Re-\nality is realized.\nM e n t a l-conscious God in the man state on the sixth plane is\nstill experiencing duality , because God in this state of conscious-\nness ﬁnds Himself as Mind and not as God.\nThis experience of duality lingers on and on until the ﬁnal in-\nvolution of consciousness attains the seventh plane of conscious-\nness. This is the ﬁnal and seventh stage in the process of involution\nof consciousness when the full consciousness of God in the man\nstate is now fully withdrawn inwards, so completely that it is now\n124 God Speaks\nﬁxed and focussed onto Himself rather than onto the objects of His\nown creation.\nNow that full consciousness has been fully involved, the ob-\njects of Nothingness, which apparently appeared to exist, vanish\ncompletely together with their impressions.\nWith complete annihilation of impressions of the associations\nof the Nothing, the impressioned consciousness of God in the man\nstate is spontaneously transformed into the unimpressioned or\ni mp ressionless consciousness of God which makes God in the\nman state experience the “passing-a w a y-in” His original state of ab-\nsolute vacuum. It is but natural that the full consciousness, fully\ninvolved, and now free from even the slightest trace of any im-\npression, should give no other experience but that of the original,\nabsolute vacuum state of God which once prevailed and which is\nnow experienced consciously.\nThis full consciousness, fully involved, is the super- c o n s c i o u s n e s s\nor the mahachaitanya. The unconscious God in the original, ab-\nsolute vacuum state is now fully conscious, or super - c o n s c i o u s ,\nof His original state of God in the Beyond the Beyond state.\nThis “passing- a w a y-in” the absolute vacuum of the original\nstate of God is called attaining the fana of the seventh plane of\nc o n s c i o u s n e s s .\nIn Sufi terms fana means “passing- a w a y-in.” Fana has two\nstages: the ﬁrst stage of fana is the conscious experience of the ab-\nsolute vacuum state, and the second stage of fana or f a n a-ﬁllah i s\nthe conscious experience of the “I am God” state.\nF a n a-fillah, the second stage, is the Goal of God in the man\nstate where God in human form, that is, as man, ultimately re a l i z e s\nthe “I am God” state with full consciousness. This is the state of ﬁn a l\nmajzoobiyat as it is termed by the Suﬁs.\nMuch before the ﬁrst stage of fana is attained, God in the man\nstate, as man, had full consciousness of the limited ego or “I,”\nmind, energ y, body and the world in an ord i n a ry awake state, be-\ncause the full consciousness of God in the man state, as man, was\nd i rectly focussed on them through their finite impressions.

When the sub-super-\nconsciousness completely involved, that is, was withdrawn inward s\nt o w a rds Himself, then God in the man state, as man, gained the\nseventh plane of super-consciousness devoid of all impr e s s i o n s .\nThis was the ﬁnal stage in attaining the Goal.\nSimultaneously with the complete involution of conscious-\nness, and on gaining super-consciousness, the mind is ﬁnally com-\npletely annihilated and vanishes once and for all time together\nwith all im p ressions. The false experiences of the limited ego or\n“I,” mind, energ y, body and the world all disappear for e v e r, van-\nishing completely , because all these experiences were but the out-\ncome of the impre ssions generated out of the Nothing, which l i t e r a l l y\nmeant nothing and were nothing.\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, with the vanishing of the limited ego or “I,”\nmind, energ y, body (typifying happiness) and worlds with all of\ntheir corresponding paraphernalia, a state of absolute vacuum is\nspontaneously experienced by the consciousness, which r e m a i n s\ne t e rnally when once it is gained. At this stage God, in the man state\nas man, with full consciousness as super-consciousness, is now only\nconscious of absolute vacuum—the consciousness is now ﬁxed and\nfocussed on “Absolute Vacuum” itself.\nThis vacuum is absolute in its entirety; vacuum alone prevails\nand there is an entire absence of the Nothing as well as of the Ev-\ne rything. This is there f o re called the “Divine, Absolute Va c u u m , ”\nand it is not born of Illusion, but it is born of Reality .\nThis state of divine vacuum prevails just at the instant when\nthe Nothing disappears or vanishes and just immediately before\nthe E v e rything ﬁlls in that vacuum to give conscious experience of\nthe reality of the “I am God” state.\nThis is the ﬁrst stage of fana w h e re all that is of the Nothing van-\nishes completely and where the super-consciousness is focussed\nonly on absolute vacuum, which now prevails as it prevails etern a l l y\nin the original God-Is state of God in original, divine sound sleep.\nT h e re f o re, in the ﬁrst stage of fana the consciousness of God, in\nthe man state as man, is not of the limited self or ego or “I,” mind,\n126 God Speaks\ne n e rg y, body and worlds, nor is the consciousness even of God or\nof the unlimited Self or Ego or “I,” universal mind, unbounded en-\ne rg y, universal body and universes; because, in this first stage of\nfana only the consciousness of absolute vacuum prevails. This vac-\nuum is also divine; it is not of Illusion but it is of Reality . In this ﬁr s t\nstage of fana the super-consciousness of God, in the man state as\nman, experiences the “passing-away-in” the absolute vacuum state\nof the original God-Is state, and is thus conscious now only of ab-\nsolute vacuum.\nAs has already been said, this same absolute vacuum state is\nalso established in the everyday sound sleep state of a normal man\nw h e re the limited ego or “I,” mind, ener g y, body and the worlds\nalso vanish and the consciousness gained remains dormant.\nThe only diff e rence, which truly makes a world of dif f e re n c e ,\nbetween the absolute vacuum state of the everyday sound sleep\nstate of man and the experience of the absolute vacuum in the ﬁr s t\nstage of fana i s ,that although the same absolute vacuum is estab-\nlished also in fana, yet in fana the consciousness no longer re m a i n s\nd o rmant. In this stage it is fully and completely matured con-\nsciousness, now actually experiencing the very same absolute vac-\nuum state as the original state of God.\nThe experience of the ﬁrst stage of fana is of the nirvana state.\nN i rvana is that state where apparently “God Is Not.” This is the\nonly state where “God Is Not” and “Consciousness Is.” This ex-\nperience of the ﬁrst stage of fana is what Buddha emphasized, but\nlater on it was misinterpreted as Buddha having emphasized that\nt h e re was no God. The re a l i t y, however, is that God Is; but in the\nabsolute vacuum state of the ﬁrst stage of fana only consciousness\nremains, experiencing absolute vacuum.\nAs it can never happen for God not to exist, in the state of nir-\nvana God plays the part of consciousness itself, which conscious-\nness is sometimes termed super-consciousness or mahachaitanya.\nThe second stage of fana follows this n i rvana state and the “I\nam God” state is experienced consciously .\nH o w e v e r, it is only in some cases that the ﬁrst stage of fana is im-\nmediately followed by the second stage of fana called “ f a n a - ﬁl l a h ”\nw h e re the annihilated false and limited ego or “I” is replaced by the",

This led God to\nrealize His Self, or made God fully conscious of God-realization. In\nother words, God’s own inﬁnite state was consciously realized by\nGod Himself when He attained the “I am God” state.*\nIn other words, God ﬁrst goes through the becoming process \nin the gross; that is, in the gross, God becomes the body of a n n a\nbhuvan ( g ross sphere). Then in the subtle He becomes the e n e rg y\nof pran bhuvan (subtle sphere). Then in the mental He becomes the\nmind of mano bhuvan (mental sphere). Beyond this in vidnyan, G o d\nbecomes God—that which He was and is and always will be. There-\nf o re God, Who was originally unconscious, now becomes oblivi-\nous of oblivion itself and gets the real and final answer to His\noriginal First W o rd—“Who am I?”—as “I am God.” Thus in the\ng ross, subtle and mental spheres God becomes actually what He re-\nally is not; and in vidnyan He becomes actually what He really i s .\nOriginally God was God; now God has become God.\nJust because God, after “passing-away-in” His original state of\nabsolute vacuum in the first stage of fana, realizes His own infi-\nnite state of “I am God” in the second stage of fana, this fana (i.e.,\nfana-ﬁllah) becomes and is the goal.\nAttainment of this goal means the end of the First Divine Jour-\nn e y, which began with gnosis and which ended, after traversing all\nplanes of consciousness, in deiﬁcation.\nThe second stage of fana i s d e i ﬁcation which means man has\nbecome God. Man now is God and experiences God’s knowledge,\nG o d ’s powers and God’s bliss; but this is not “Perfection” as yet,\na lthough it is the goal. At the second stage of fana or the f a n a -\nﬁllah, which is the end of the ﬁrst divine journ e y, man has e n t e re d\nGod and thus has become God, but has not yet entered God’s life.\nMan at the end of the first divine journey simply realizes that he\nis God and simply experiences the “I am God” state together with\n130 God Speaks\n* The happiness of God-realization is the Goal of all Creation. The real happiness\nwhich comes through realizing God is worth all physical and mental sufferings in\nthe universe. Then all suffering is as if it were not.

Thus in\nbaqa the life of God in a human being is established. This means\nthat in baqa man establishes himself as God consciously . This con-\nsciousness is called “sulukiyat” or the normal consciousness of b e -\ning “established in the life of God.” Distinct from this is the m a j-\nzoobiyat or “being drowned or absorbed by inﬁnite bliss” in the state\nof “I am God.” Accord i n g l y, God as man, experiencing the state o f\nbaqa, i scalled the real “Salik” in Suﬁ t e rm i n o l o g y. This baqa of Re-\nality and Divinity is called “ b a q a-billah.” In Vedanta it is known\nas “atmapratisthapana.”\nThe Salik not only experiences infinite power and infinite\nknowledge while in inﬁnite bliss, as in majzoobiyat, but, now being\nthe Salik, He consciously accumulates all the inﬁnite power, inﬁ-\nnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss while being established in the life\nof God with the normal consciousness of His sulukiyat.\nBut before finally and really “passing- a w a y-in” the reality of\nthe ultimate f a n a-fillah state with full consciousness completely\nm a t u red, and before getting established in the ﬁnal baqa-billah o f\nDivinity, generally speaking in terms of Illusion, there are as many\nindividualized experiences of fana-baqa as there are varied and in-\nnumerable species and states of life in Creation.\nNevertheless, three fundamental types of fana-baqa include all\nthe individualized experiences of fana-baqa.\nThe first of the three fundamental types is the r u d i m e n t a ry.\nThis type is the f a n a-baqa of the phenomenal, false life in Illusion\nexperienced by all who, daily “passing- a w a y-in” fana, gain b a q a\nto “abide-in” Illusion every day .

In both types the\n132 God Speaks\nfana ( “ p a s s i n g-a w a y-in”) is fundamentally the same, for daily in the\nsound sleep state the impressioned consciousness, in both cases,\n“passes-away-in” the same state of absolute vacuum, regardless of\nall the differences in the types of impressions of Illusion.\nAlthough the fana is always the same in both the evolving c o n-\nsciousness and the i n v o l v i n gconsciousness, yet it is the type of im-\np ressions of Illusion with which the consciousness is impre g n a t e d ,\nwhile abiding in Illusion during the awake state, that really mat-\nters, and that does create the diff e rentiation when “passing-away-\nin” the sound sleep state or in the state of fana.\nFor example, the fana of an animal or a cre a t u re in the sound\nsleep state “passing- a w a y-in” the absolute vacuum, with its own\np a rticular impressions of Illusion, differs completely from the f a n a\nof a human being in the sound sleep state “passing- a w a y-in” the\nabsolute vacuum with his own particular impressions of Illusion.\nS i m i l a r l y, the impressions of Illusion of an ord i n a ry human being\nwill be quite different from the impressions of Illusion of a human\nbeing in the planes of the path.\nIn all cases, though the diff e rent types of fana remain always as\nfana, yet the diff e rent impressions impregnating individual con-\nsciousness in the baqa of the awake state give rise to the individu-\nalized fana of each and all species and states of life in Creation.\nIn contrast with that, when the baqa of the individualized life\nis gained in the awake state after the sound sleep state of fana, the\nbaqa, which in Suﬁ t e rms means “abiding-in,” establishes in Illu-\nsion the everyday individualized life of Illusion in accordance with\nthe predominant impressions with which the individualized life\nhad “passed away” from the variety of impressions of Illusion in\nthe state of its individualized fana, in the sound sleep state. As\nsuch, every individualized baqa completely differs from every other\nbaqa, because when this individualized baqa is gained in the awake\nstate, the impressions of the impressioned consciousness of every\nindividualized life are solely responsible for establishing in Illusion\nthe individualized life of Illusion.\nHence it is that in re g u l a r, unfailing succession the fana of Illu-\nsion in the sound sleep state is invariably followed by the baqa o f\nIllusion in the awake state, which in turn gets lost in the inevitable",

It is never stable as long as it is of the Illusion.\nAs long as individualized life does not really and ﬁnally “pass-\naway-in” the f a n a-ﬁllah of Reality and become established in the\nabiding b a q a-billah of Divinity , it is obvious that there are bound \nto be innumerable and diverse types and groups of fana-baqa o f\nIllusion in accordance with the persisting impressions that con-\nsistently impress the evolving and the involving consciousness of\nindividualized life in baqa.\nIn every plane also, from the ﬁrst through the sixth plane of in-\nvolving consciousness, there is bound to be a particular type of\nbaqa for each of the six planes, in accordance with the par t i c u l a r\nimpressions of the Illusion of each plane.\nWhen a man is said to be on the ﬁrst plane his fully evolved con-\nsciousness is beginning to involve, and his full consciousness re-\nmains focussed on the ﬁrst plane of the subtle sphere, because the\ni m p ressions of the first plane consistently impregnating his in-\nvolving consciousness make him abide in the ﬁrst plane and lead\nhim to experience the illusion of this plane. Even though the gro s s\nbody of the man on the first plane is exactly like the gross body\nof a man n o ton the first plane, and though the man on the first\nplane also sleeps and wakes up exactly like an or d i n a ry man of\nthe everyday phenomenal, false life, yet, because his involving con-\nsciousness is directly focussed on the ﬁrst plane, he “passes-away-\nin” the sound sleep state of the ﬁrst plane fana with the impre s s i o n s\nof the illusion of the ﬁrst plane, and wakes up daily to get estab-\nlished in the ﬁrst plane baqa to “abide-in” the ﬁrst plane, and to ex-\nperience the impressions of that plane.\nThe diff e rence between the f a n a-baqa of the man who enters\nthe planes of the path and of the man who is not on the planes\nof the path is that the former can be likened to a man who, after\nliving for many years in a certain place, severs all of his past con-\nnections and sets out on a world tour, travelling from one place to\na n o t h e r, crossing continents one after the other. Although this\n134 God Speaks\nman would be daily going to sleep, and awakening the next day , as\nhe was accustomed to sleeping and awakening every day in his\nﬁrst habitat, yet now in the course of his world tour he would be\n“ p a s sing-away-in” sound sleep and would be daily waking up evi-\ndently with the predominant impressions of his completely\nchanged environments and novel experiences.22\nIn short\n, he who enters the ﬁrst plane of involving conscious-\nness eventually experiences the ﬁrst plane fully . This man, who is\ngetting established in the ﬁrst plane, establishes his living in this\n“world of his own” and there f o re he sleeps in this plane and wakes\nup every day in this plane as well. In exactly the same way , all in-\ndividualized consciousness in all other planes “passes-a w a y-in” the\nfana of those particular planes to wake up in such planes and es-\ntablish the everyday life baqa in these particular planes.\nN e v e rtheless, the f a n a-baqa of every plane of the path is fun-\ndamentally of the same type, because it pertains only to conscious-\nness that is involving gradually and not to that of the evolving n o r\nof the evolved consciousness. Whatever dif f e rence there is to dif-\nf e rentiate the f a n a-baqa of one plane from another plane would\nonly be such as would exist between two men living on two dif-\nf e rent continents of the same earth and having their own individ-\nual impressions of that particular part of the earth on which each\nlives. The man in America has his own impressions and relative ex-\nperiences of his individualized life; the same is true of the man in\nAsia who has his own impressions and experiences related to his\ncontinent which is quite different from America.\nBut the fundamental fact remains that both men live on the\nsame earth. Despite the vast diff e rence between the impressions and\nthe consequent experiences of these two men, yet when both sleep,\nthey both “pass-a w a y-in” sound sleep. And, whether one sleeps on\na bed of velvet and the other on a bed of hay , it is quite immaterial\nwhen both can equally enjoy the same sound sleep state. In like\nm a n n e r, when both wake up they both can live their individual lives\nin illusion on the same earth, irrespective of the diff e rence in their\ni m p ressions and their consequent relative experiences due to living\non diff e rent continents.

The cause of this igno-\nrance is but the impressions—sanskaras.\nSo God, Who is eternally in the Beyond the Beyond state of\nParatpar Parabrahma or in the inﬁnitude state of God-Is, in the be-\nginning acquires ignorance through being impressed by the im-\npressions rather than by acquiring knowledge of His reality .\nHence when God acquires a particular form, body or sharir a c-\nc o rding to particular impressions, He feels and experiences Him-\nself as that particular form, body or s h a r i r. God in His stone-f o rm\nexperiences Himself as stone. Accord i n g l y, in consonance with im-\npressions and their consciousness, God feels and experiences that\nHe is metal, vegetation, worm, ﬁsh, bird, animal or human being.\nWhatever be the type of the gross form and whatever be the shape\nof the form, the evolving consciousness of God tends God spon-\ntaneously to associate Himself with that form, figure and shape\nwhich tends Him to experience Himself through impressions that\nHe is that form, ﬁgure and shape.\nS i m i l a r l y, when God is conscious of the subtle body (i.e., t h e\npran) then God experiences the subtle world and r e g a rds Him-\nself as the subtle body or pran. Likewise, God becomes conscious\nof the mental body ( i.e., the mana or the mind), experiences the\nmental world and re g a rds Himself as the mental body or the m a n a\n(i.e., the mind).\nIt is only because of impressions that the inﬁnite God, the Over-\nSoul, without form and inﬁnite, experiences that He is veritably but\na finite gross body in the gross sphere (i.e., the j i v-atma in a n n a\n144 God Speaks\nb h uv a n), or a subtle body in the subtle sphere (i.e., the jiv-atma i n\npran bhuvan), or a mental body in the mental sphere (i.e., the j i v -\natma in the mano bhuvan). God, while experiencing the gross world\nt h rough gross forms, associates with and dissociates from innu-\nm e rable gross forms. The association with and dissociation fr o m\ngross forms are called “birth” and “death,” respectively .\nIt is because of impressions that the eternal, immortal, form l e s s\nGod, or the Over-Soul, without births and deaths, has to experience\nb i rths and deaths a number of times. While God has toe x p e r i e n c e\nthese innumerable births and deaths because of impressions, He has\nnot only to experience the gross world which is ﬁnite and there f o re\nfalse, but together with it He has also to experience its happiness\nand misery , its virtue and vice.\nAll forms, ﬁg u res and shapes, all worlds and planes, all birt h s\nand deaths, all virtue and vice, all happiness and misery , experi-\nenced by God, Who is eternal, formless and inﬁnite, are the out-\ncome of impressioned consciousness. Since all impressions areb u t\nthe outcome of the Nothing that manifested as the Nothingness,\nit means that whatever God experiences through His evolved con-\nsciousness in the gross, subtle and mental worlds is the experience\nof the Nothing; and as this Nothing by nature is nothing, there f o re\nall the experiences in the inter m e d i a ry illusory states of God are\nnothing but literally illusion and, as such, false and ﬁnite.\nOnly when the impressioned consciousness is freed from all\ni m p ressions is liberation or mukti in human form attained as n i r-\nvana or fana, w h e re only consciousness “Is” and where all else of\nthe Nothing, which was as Nothingness, vanishes for e v e r. Only\nin the case of the one who retains the body* for three to four days†\nafter nirvana does the liberated (or the unimpressioned or impres-\nsi\nonless) consciousness invariably realize eternal Godhood in the\nsecond stage of fana (i.e., in f a n a-fillah) and assert itself as “I am\nGod” without doubt. This is the nirvikalpa state of “Undoubtedly",

The period mentioned (three to four days) holds meaning only for the\nunderstanding of those who are gross-conscious and are bound by time. Ed.]\nI am God” when, literally , the impressionless or unimpre s s i o n e d\nconsciousness, linked with human-form, realizes “I am God, I was\nGod and fore v e rm o re will remain God” as Existence, eternal and\nconscious. In this way man becomes God; and it is said that man is\nG o d-realized, or that the j i v-atma in Paramatma has become the\nShiv-Atma in Paramatma, or the Over-Soul.\nThe eternal reality is that Paramatma, or the Over-Soul, is a t m a\nor the soul; and this reality is realized only when the impre s s i o n e d\nconsciousness as j i v-atma becomes the impressionless or unim-\np ressioned consciousness as S h i v-Atma, m e rging in Paramatma t o\nassert and realize the identity of Paramatma.\nIf in reality atma is Paramatma, how then could any situation\narise for atma to merge in Paramatma?\nIn order to clarify this situation and understand that P a r a m-\natma is atma in re a l i t y, we compare Paramatma with an infinite,\nlimitless and shoreless ocean. There f o re atma, which is P a r a m a t m a ,\ncan never be out of bounds of the limitless and shoreless ocean\n(i.e., Paramatma). Atma can never be out of Paramatma b e c a u s e\nParamatma, which we have compared to the limitless and shore-\nless ocean, is inﬁnite and unlimited. How could atma come out of\nor have a place beyond the expanse of the limitless when atma i s\nParamatma?\nHence, atma is in Paramatma, too.\nN o w, in order to understand that the atma which is i nP a r a m-\natma is in reality Paramatma Itself, let us imagine that it is possible\nto separate or take one iota of the ocean out of the limitless expanse\nof the unlimited and shoreless ocean. It follows then that this iota\nof ocean, when in the limitless ocean, is ocean itself before sepa-\nration, and was in the unlimited ocean not as an iota of the ocean\nbut as the ocean itself (because every iota of ocean when not lim-\nited by the limitations of being an iota is unlimited ocean itself).\nIt is only when the iota of the ocean is separated from the un-\nlimited ocean, or is taken out of the unlimited ocean, as a drop, that\nthis separated iota of the ocean is looked upon as the limited drop\nof the unlimited ocean.\nIn other words, the inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean now\nis made to look upon itself through the drop as merely the limited\n146 God Speaks\nd rop of that inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean; and in com-\nparison to the inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean, this drop of\nocean is most ﬁnite, most limited, and has now inﬁnite limitations.\nS i m i l a r l y, atma, as compared to the drop of the inﬁnite ocean, can\nnever be out of any limitations of the limitless and inﬁnite P a r a m-\na t m aas compared to the inﬁnite, unlimited and shoreless ocean.\nBut just as the iota of ocean acquires its limitations as a dr o p\nt h rough a bubble on the surface of the ocean, and just as this bubble\nbestows upon the iota of the ocean an apparent separative and lim-\nited existence apart from the inﬁnite ocean, likewise atma, w h i c h\nis not only in Paramatma but which is Paramatma Itself, appare n t l y\nexperiences and asserts separative existence from the inﬁnite, un-\nlimited Paramatma t h rough the limitations of the bubble of im-\np ressions, which bestow conscious ignorance, and with which a t m a\ns h rouds itself and experiences itself as limited and separate fr o m\nParamatma.\nT h rough these limitations, formed by the bubble of impr e s-\nsions, self-c reated by atma, atma a p p a rently inherits a separative\nand limited existence from P a r a m a t m a ,and because of this self-\ncreated separativeness from inﬁnite Paramatma, atma, which is It-\nself infinite, unlimited and unbounded, bestows upon Itself the\naspects of being most finite and most limited, with infinite limi-\ntations acquired through impressions.\nAs soon as the bubble of impressions bursts on completion of",

When people actually see him ill they do not see him ill but\nin reality they see his illness p e rfectly enacted because he is the\nPerfect Master and perfection personiﬁed; he acts as if he were ill.\nOn the other hand, when people see the Avatar ill, He has a c t u-\nally fallen ill and He has literally become ill.

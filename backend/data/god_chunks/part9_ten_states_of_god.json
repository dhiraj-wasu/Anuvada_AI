    "text": "second state of God, de-\nnoted in the chart as “II” and termed “God in Beyond State,” is in\n162 God Speaks\nno way to be taken as a state of God altogether other than the most-\noriginal ﬁrst state of God, denoted in the chart as “I” and term e d\n“God in Beyond-Beyond State.”\nThe only diff e rence between State I and State II of God is that\nState I is of unbounded, absolute, inﬁnite Divine Vacuum, where\neven the remotest prospect of the insurge of the inﬁnite whim is in-\nconceivable. There f o re, only at the instant when the original inﬁ-\nnite whim insurges in the infinitude of the God-Is state could\ni n ﬁnite God conceive the inﬁnite original urg e - t o - k n o w, as “Who\nam I?”—that is, only when the aspectless State I of God in Beyond-\nBeyond gets the aspect of State II of God in Beyond. Paratpar Para-\nbrahma thus gets the inﬁnite aspect of Paramatma.\nIt is also to be noted very carefully that the Beyond state marked\nin the chart as “II” is fundamentally the same as the Beyond-Beyond\nstate of God marked in the chart as “ I.” But in the chart these t w o\nstates, State I and State I I, are depicted separately , because even\nthough State II of God in Beyond state is the sameoriginal state of\nGod, yet it is not the most-original state of God which is the Beyond-\nBeyond state. This necessarily follows because God could conceive\nthe inﬁnite insurge of the inﬁnite original whim and could get the\ninfinite original impulse of the infinite original ur g e - t o - k n o w, as\n“Who am I?” only in State I I, when God eternally in State I a s s u m e s\nthe inﬁnite original aspect of State I Iwithin His own eternal State\nI which is the most-original Beyond-Beyond state.\nT o be more explicit, in both these states of God (States I and I I) ,\nexcept for the eternally manifest inﬁnity of the eternal inﬁnitude of\nGod (as the unbounded, absolute, inﬁnite Divine Vacuum), all at-\ntributes, all aspects, all states, inﬁnite and most-ﬁnite conscious-\nness and unconsciousness of God, including God’s own infinite\ntrio-nature of power, knowledge and bliss and all other things, are\nall latent in the unbounded, absolute, inﬁnite Divine Vacuum.\nAll this that is latent in the Inﬁnitude could only have the scope\nof manifestation in State I Iof God, which may be said to differ fro m\nState I only in this respect, of having this infinite scope of mani-\nfestation of all that is inﬁn i t e l y, and most ﬁn i t e l y, latent as the Noth-\ning in the inﬁnitude of God as the Everything.\nThe T en States of God 163\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the inﬁnite original whim of God, when it once\ns u rged, had the feasibility of surging only in State I Iof God; and\nwhen it surged, it did so uniformly in the infinitude of God. But\nwhen the whim surged, the insurge of this whim could never be\nexperienced by God in His inﬁnitely most independent Beyond-\nBeyond State I; it was experienced by God, eternally in the most-\noriginal Beyond-Beyond state, only through the inﬁnite aspect of\nHis State II as “God in the Beyond State.”\nHence, the inﬁnite insurge of the inﬁnite original whim and its\nconsequent inﬁnite re p e rcussions are in reality effected in the State\nII of God in the Beyond state.\nAt the instant when the inﬁnite original whim surged and God\nhad the inﬁnite original urge-to-know—as “Who am I?”—the in-\nﬁnite uniformity of the inﬁnite insurge of the whim spontaneously\nmade manifest both the latent inﬁnite consciousness and the latent\ni n ﬁnite unconsciousness of God simultaneously in the original B e-\nyond state of God, Who is nevertheless eternally in the most-original\nBeyond-Beyond state.\nThis spontaneous manifestation of the latent infinite con-\nsciousness and inﬁnite unconsciousness s i m u l t a n e o u s l y, is beyond\nthe grasp of human intellect to understand and digest. It is indeed\na paradox of the realm of Reality , and it defeats all human under-\nstanding. How could God gain spontaneously His own inﬁnite con-\nsciousness and His inﬁnite unconsciousness simultaneously? Meher\nBaba, while explaining this, declared that this is a fact, and it is of\nthe realm of Reality , but it can never be understood or grasped by the\nmind; it is only to be realized on realizing the Reality. At the same\ntime, in order that we may get at least some concept of this fact ef-\nfected in Reality , and that we may not take it as a mere paradoxical\nm y s t e ry , Meher Baba made us understand this apparent paradox\nthrough the example of a child in a mother’s womb.\nWhen the mother conceives, the child is under development\nin the mother’s womb; and as soon as the development reaches \na stage when, along with other developments, the eyes of the child\na re fully moulded, the child gains the faculties of “seeing” and “not-\nseeing” simultaneously. Irrespective of whether the child, after\n164 God Speaks\nb i rth, sees or does not see, the very fact that the eyes have been\nmoulded in the womb of his mother gives to the child the dual as-\npect of his own eyes. In the eyes, as soon as they are developed,\nthe faculties of seeing and not-seeing are simultaneously contained.\nWhen the child opens his eyes he will see and when he closes his\neyes he will not-see; but the fact still holds good that no sooner were\nthe eyes developed than there was contained in them the dual fac-\nulty of seeing and not-seeing simultaneously.\nS i m i l a r l y, with the insurge of the original infinite whim in\nGod, both the inﬁnite consciousness and unconsciousness, latent\nin God, were manifested simultaneously , which to the limited mind\nappears paradoxical.\nThus God in His most-original State I of the Beyond-Beyond\ngained spontaneously, through His original State II of the Beyond,\nHis own inﬁnitely unconscious state and His own inﬁnitely con-\nscious state simultaneously , depicted in the chart as states A and B ,\nrespectively .\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, on the one hand, with the spontaneous mani-\nfestation of inﬁnite unconsciousness, God in His inﬁnite, u n c o n-\nscious Beyond state, shown as “A” in the chart, eternally remains not\nonly inﬁnitely unconscious of His own eternal, inﬁnite existence,\nas in the most-original Beyond-Beyond state of Inﬁn i t u d e - A b s o l u t e ,\nbut He also eternally remains inﬁnitely unconscious of His own be-\ngotten inﬁnite original Beyond state, shown in the chart as “II.”\nOn the other hand, simultaneously with the spontaneous mani-\nfestation of inﬁnite consciousness, God in His inﬁnite, c o n s c i o u s\nBeyond state, marked in the chart as “B,” e t e rnally becomes not only\ninﬁnitely conscious of His own eternal inﬁnite existence, as in the\nmost-original Beyond-Beyond state of Inﬁnitude-Absolute, but He\nalso becomes, most obviously , inﬁnitely conscious of His own be-\ngotten inﬁnite original Beyond state, shown in the chart as “II.”\nIn other words, only in the Beyond state of God, marked in the\nc h a rt as State II, God spontaneously , with the insurge of the inﬁ-\nnite original whim, simultaneously begets His eternal, inﬁnite un-\nconscious state, marked as sub-state A, and His eternal, infinite\nconscious state, marked as sub-state B.\nThe Ten States of God 165\n166 God Speaks\nSub-state A is of God in Beyond state, marked as State II. T h i s\nsub-state A is of divine inﬁnite unconsciousness of God’s own in-\nﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss. God in this sub-\nstate A neither consciously experiences His own trio-nature of\ninﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss, nor uses them.\nSub-state B is also of God in Beyond state, marked as State I I .\nThis sub-state B is attributeless and formless, but is of highest di-\nvine consciousness of God’s own infinite trio-nature of infinite\np o w e r, knowledge and bliss. God in this sub-state B consciously ex-\nperiences His own inﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁn i t e\nbliss but He does not use them. He is conscious of His Reality but\nis unconscious of Illusion.\nIn Vedantic term i n o l o g y, it is thus that the State I of P a r a t p a r\nParabrahma begets the State II of Paramatma; and in this State\nII, God as Paramatma is eternally unconscious and simultane-\nously e t e rnally conscious of His own most-original state of P a r a t-\npar Parabrahma. This inﬁnite dual aspect of the Paramatma state is\npointed out in the chart as state A and state B respectively .\nIt naturally follows, there f o re, that the eternal unconscious state\nof Paramatma, marked “A,” in the eternal original Beyond state,\nmarked “II,” e t e rnally aspires to attain the eternal conscious state of\nParamatma, marked “B,” which is the second of the dual inﬁnite as-\npects of the original Beyond God state (Paramatma) m a r k e d“ I I . ”\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the divine goal is that the unconscious state of\nGod in “A” should attain the conscious Reality of the conscious\nstate of God in “B.”\nIn short, when state A consciously realizes state B, the divine goal\nis attained.\nFor state A to realize consciously state B, t h e re is no other al-\nt e rnative but that state A must gradually experience transmutation\ninto state B and eventually become state B in all respects consciously .\nThis gradual transmutation of the unconscious, inﬁnite state\nof God into the conscious, inﬁnite state is depicted through States\nIII, IV , V , VIand VII as diff e rent states of God in the chart of the Te n\nStates of God. In State VIII, state A of God becomes fully conscious\nof state B.\nIn this State VIII, the unconscious inﬁnite state A of God not\nonly gains the highest divine consciousness of state B, but God\nb ecomes divinely absorbed in the Reality of His own inﬁnite con-\nscious state and so realizes His eternal identity with the inﬁnite con-\nscious state B of God.\nIf God, divinely absorbed, as in State VIII, recovers and main-\ntains normal consciousness of the mental, subtle and gross sphere s\nt h rough His mental, subtle and gross aspects as an embodiment\nof a perfect human being, then State IX, at the Divine Junction be-\ntween States VIII and X, is attained. After this ninth state, the tenth\nstate of God is depicted in the chart and connected with the God\nstate C.\nThis"

    "text": "tenth state of God is the state of God qualitied and mani-\nfest in the human form of a Perfect Master. In State X God con-\nsciously experiences His own trio-nature of inﬁnite power, inﬁn i t e\nknowledge and inﬁnite bliss, and also uses them through the Di-\nvine Ofﬁce of God, State X, marked in the chart as “C.”\nIt is also to be well noted that God in the inﬁnite, unconscious\nstate A is neither n i rguna ( a t t r i b u t e l e s s )-nirakar ( f o rm l e s s), nor s a-\nguna (with attributes)-sakar (with form). But state B is of nirguna-\nnirakar (attributeless and form l e s s), and state C (which is also of\nthe original Beyond God state) is of saguna-sakar (with attributes\nand form). It is that highest state of Man-God where God is infi-\nnitely conscious of both Reality and Illusion.\nState III\nGod as Emanator, Sustainer and Dissolver\nIn this state God brings into play His three principal attributes\n(sifat) of emanating, sustaining and dissolving. This thr e e - i n - o n e\nstate corresponds to the trinity of Vedanta: Brahma ( C re a t o r),\nVishnu ( P re s e rv e r) and Mahesh ( D e s t royer)—the Suﬁ synonyms of\nwhich are the terms Afridgar , Parvardigar and Fanakar.\nThe three attributes of God are expressed through the thr e e\nA rchangels, Israfeel (the angel who creates life), Mikaeel (the angel\nwho sustains life) and Izraeel (the angel who destroys life).\nThe Ten States of God 167\nThe triple attributes of State III of God were latent in the most-\noriginal State I of God; these, simultaneously, unfolded them-\nselves spontaneously at that instant when the original infinite\nwhim surged in God and when He conceived in His State II t h e\ni n ﬁnite urge-to-know Himself, as “Who am I?” At that instant of\nthe insurge of the inﬁnite whim, God in His State II gained simul-\ntaneously the inﬁnite, dual aspects of being inﬁnitely unconscious\nas in His state A and at the same time, of being inﬁnitely conscious\nas in His state B.\nN e v e rtheless the inﬁnite original urge-to-know Himself obvi-\nously persists still in God state A which is yet inﬁnitely unconscious\nof Himself. The inﬁnite urge-to-know Himself persisting in this in-\nﬁnitely unconscious state A of God made possible the m a n i f e s t a t i o n s\nof all the qualities and aspects of God latent as the Nothing in the\ni n ﬁnitude of the most-original State I of God as the Every t h i n g .\nBut all that is latent as the Nothing in theE v e rything could be pos-\nsibly conceived as latent in the Beyond State II of God only .\nW h e re f o re, all that is latent in the Beyond state of God is gradu-\nally unfolded, propelled by the inﬁnite urge, and is spontaneously\nmade to manifest as all that is of the Nothing. Hence the Nothing-\nness of the Nothing that is manifested is the Creation; and this Cre-\nation springs forth out of the inﬁnite urge-to-know in the inﬁn i t e ,\nunconscious state A of God. Consequently , it is only natural that the\ni n ﬁnite, unconscious state A of God gains the ﬁrst attribute as Ema-\nn a t o r, of the three inﬁnite attributes: God the Cre a t o r, God the Pre-\nserver and God the Dissolver or Destroyer.\nFor God to have gained the attribute of Emanator, He obviously\nbecomes the Creator of Creation, as in His State III.\nIt then follows most naturally that when God creates, He must\nspontaneously also sustain what He creates. He then obviously be-\ncomes also the Preserver of Creation, as in His State III.\nAnd in the very act of pre s e rving what is created, God also si-\nmultaneously establishes the inevitable dissolution or destruction\nof Creation. Pre s e rvation would be meaningless if dissolution or\nd e s t ruction were not anticipated. Accordingly God obviously be-\ncomes also the Dissolver or Destroyer of Creation, as in His State I I I .\n168 God Speaks\nState III of God is that state in which God becomes the Cre a t o r\nand simultaneously remains the Sustainer or Pre s e rver and Dissolver\nor Destroyer of His own Creation. At one and the same time, God\nthus becomes the Cre a t o r, Pre s e rver and Destroyer in State I I I .\nThe inﬁnite original whim that surged in God and the conse-\nquent inﬁnite urge-to-know Himself made manifest in God the in-\nﬁnite triple attributes of Cre a t o r, Pre s e rver and Dissolver, with all\nthe paraphernalia of the Nothingness of the latent Nothing. This\nNothingness literally is nothing, although it appears to exist\nthrough Illusion (sometimes called Maya35) as the Cr\neation.\nMeher Baba has told us that there is no Creation in the literal\nsense of the word. What we call Creation is a manifestation of count-\nless f o rms of the Nothing. This Nothing is really “no-thing”—but it\nexists in its own ﬁeld of Illusion. It cannot be denied, but it is not\nbeyond the Everything, that is, God. Although the Everything in-\ncludes this Nothing, the Nothing never does and never can include\nor mean the Everything. The Almighty alone is the Everything, in-\ncluding the Nothing; and before Creation manifested itself, there\nwas literally and absolutely “no-thing” but the Almighty as the\nEverything.\nZat thi Allah ki aur jalve sab ruposh the\nIk saut-i sarmadi tha naGme sab K amosh the\nTha faqav maiK anah saqi tha nah vaj mainosh the\nKa-yi nate dahar kya ruh ul-amin bihosh the\nZindagi jab muskura’i hai qaxa ke samne.\n—Munsiff-AsGar\n“The existence of Allah alone was and all manifestations\nwere latent therein;\nOne Eternal Sound prevailed, and all musical notes were\ndormant therein;\nOnly the tavern was there—no cup-bearers and wine-\ndrinkers;\nThe gross universe was out of the question—even the an-\ngelic world was not in existence,\nWhen, with the divine command ‘Be,’ life smilingly sprang\nup.”\nThe T en States of God 169\nThe Almighty alone existed, but He was only latently conscious,\nand hence He did not know Himself, and in the same way that con-\nsciousness was latent in Him, so also Creation was latent in Him.\nThe diff e rence between the latent and the manifest Cr e a t i o n\nmay be compared to that between a seed and a tree. But, whether\nseed or tree, latent or manifest, Creation is always “no-thing,” be-\ncause it is the latent Nothing that is manifested as the Nothingness.\nAll that is latent as the Nothing in the Beyond State II of the\ni nfinitude of God as the Everything is expressed and manifested\nt h rough a most ﬁnite point in the inﬁnitude of God. This point is\ncalled the “creation point” or the “Om point.”* Through this point\nCreation has been precipitated. This creation point was also latent\nin the most original State I of God, in the Beyond-Beyond state.\nThe process of emanating, sustaining and dissolving, which is\nconstantly and uniformly going on, may be illustrated by an anal-\no g y. Let us imagine that a human body is God. The human body\nsleeping with eyes shut may then be compared to the Beyond state\nof God, as State II–A. The very first moment of opening the eyes\nmay be compared to the state of God as Cr e a t o r. The subsequent\ncondition of remaining awake may be compared to the state of God\nas Sustainer, and going back to sleep again with eyes shut may be\nc o m p a red to the state of God as Dissolver. Thus God is the Cre a t o r,\nSustainer and Dissolver, all three in One, at one and the same time.\nState IV\nGod as Embodied Soul\nDid apni thi use Kvahish\nAp ko har tarah bana dekha.\n—Niyaz\n“He desired to see Himself; hence He assumed to Himself\nvaried aspects involving names and forms.”\nIn order to understand how the inﬁnitely unconscious state A o f\nGod becomes gradually transmuted into the infinitely conscious\n170 God Speaks\n* [See also Francis Brabazon, Stay with God ( Woombye, Queensland, Australia:\nE dwards and Shaw for Garuda Books, 1959), 65–66. Ed.]\nstate B of God and attains full and inﬁnite consciousness, Meher\nBaba gave the following analogy:\nImagine the infinitely unconscious God state A, b e f o re the\nC reation came into being, as motionless inﬁnite ocean. A puff of\nwind then stirred the tranquil uniformity of this ocean, and im-\nmense waves, countless drops of water, and innumerable bubbles\na p p e a red from out of the uniformity of the limitless, inﬁnite ocean.\nThe puff of wind that set the ocean into commotion may be com-\np a red to the impulse of the infinite, original urge-to-know origi-\nnating with the inﬁnite, original whim of God, surging in God to\nknow Himself through His inﬁnite God State II.\nThe stir on the surface of the ocean, caused by the inﬁnite urg e ,\ns u rc h a rged every drop of that inﬁnite ocean with the inﬁnite origi-\nnal urge-to-know itself.\nThus Paramatma in His infinitely unconscious state A, b e i n g\nu rged to know Himself, simultaneously bestirs the tranquil poise\nof every atma in Paramatma with an urge to know itself. This could\nonly be understood when Paramatma is compared to an infinite\nocean and the atmas to the drops of that inﬁnite ocean. But it must\nalso be well noted that every drop of the ocean, when in the ocean,\nis ocean itself, until the drops inherit individuality through bubble\nf o rmations over the surface of the ocean. Every bubble thus form e d\nwould then bestow a separate and a particular individuality upon\ne v e ry drop. And this created separateness would exist within the\nu n i f o rm indivisibility of the drops of the inﬁnite ocean as long as\nthese bubbles creating separateness exist. As soon as the bubbles\nburst, the drops, which are and were already in the ocean itself, come\nto realize that they are and were one with the inﬁnite ocean; and t h e y\ngain this consciousness of their e t e rnal infinity in the infinite\nocean only after they first experience separateness and then dis-\npel the bubbles of ignorance that were instrumental in bestowing\nupon them the experience of their apparent separateness from their\ninherent indivisibility .\nAs long as the inﬁnitely innumerable drops of the ocean do not\nexperience apparent separateness, they fail to realize their own\nh omogeneous and indivisible eternal, inﬁnite existence as ocean\nitself. It is only through the experience of apparent separateness\nThe Ten States of God 171\nthat atmas can consciously realize their indivisible Oneness as\nP a r a m a t m a .\nIn order to describe the God State IV of “God as Embodied\nSoul,” let us think of one inﬁnitely unconscious soul (atma) of P a r a m-\natma in state A .\nIn the beginning, in state A, the soul (atma) has no conscious-\nness and has no impressions (sanskaras).\nT h e re f o re, at that stage and in that state the soul (atma) has no\ng ross form, gross body , subtle body nor mental body , because the\nexistence of gross, subtle and mental impressions ( s a n s k a r a s )\nonly can give existence to gross, subtle and mental bodies; a n d\nonly the existence of these bodies can make possible the existence\nof gross, subtle and mental worlds.\nHence in the beginning the soul in God state A, being inﬁn i t e l y\nunconscious and being impressionless, had no consciousness of\ng ross, subtle and mental bodies, and was also unconscious of its\ni nfinite Self. The soul naturally then had no experience of the\ng ross, subtle and mental worlds, and also had no experience of the\nOver-Soul (Paramatma).\nNow this inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious, tranquil state\nof the soul reverberated with the ﬁrst impulse, which we called The\nFirst Urge (the ﬁrst urge to know Itself).\nSimultaneously with reverberations of the ﬁrst urge to know It-\nself, a m o s t - g ross ﬁrst impression emerged, objectifying the soul as\nthe absolutely opposite and most-finite counterpart of the ab-\nsolutely inﬁnite Over-Soul.\nThe soul, being eternally in the Over-Soul and one with the\nO v e r-Soul, has also the inﬁnite potentialities of the Over - S o u l ,\nthough latent in its unconscious state. Thus the soul is also the\npossessor of inﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss.\nT h e re f o re, when the impressionless, inﬁnite soul receives the\nv e ry ﬁrst impression, this impression could be nothing other than\nthe most-gross impression, because the soul itself, which is the\npossessor of inﬁnite knowledge, tries to gain knowledge of its own\n“Self.” This very conception on the part of the possessor of inﬁn i t e\nknowledge is inﬁnitely crude or gross, and this inﬁnitely crude or\n172 God Speaks\ng ross conception of the inﬁnite soul imparted to the impre s s i o n l e s s\nsoul the most-gross ﬁrst impression. Simultaneously with the most-\ng ross ﬁrst impression, the inﬁnitely unconscious soul also gained\nt h em o s t - ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness. With the increasing gross im-\np ressions, the consciousness evolved and the evolution of gr o s s\nforms gained momentum.\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, the evolution of consciousness, the evolution\nof g ross forms and the evolution of the experiences of the gr o s s\nworld were all effected as the result of the ﬁrst urge of God to know\nH i m s e l f .\nBecause of this most-gross ﬁrst impression of the ﬁrst urge, the\ni n ﬁnite, unconscious soul gained the aspects of experience for the\nﬁrst time. This ﬁrst experience of the inﬁnite soul was that it (soul,\na t m a) experienced a contrariety (absolutely opposite by nature) in\nits identity with the inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious state A o f\nP a r a m a t m a.\nThis experience of contrariety effected changeableness in the\neternal, indivisible stability of the inﬁnite soul; and spontaneously\nt h e re occurred a sort of eruption, disrupting the indivisible poise\nand unconscious tranquility of the inﬁnite soul with a recoil or tre-\nmendous shock, which impregnated the inﬁnite unconsciousness\nof the inﬁnitely unconscious soul ( a t m a )with ﬁrst consciousness\nof its apparent separateness from the indivisible state of P a r a m a t m a.\nBut the soul being inﬁnite, the ﬁrst consciousness that it derived\nf rom the recoil or shock of the absolutely opposite and most-gross\nfirst impression of its separateness was naturally and necessarily\nmost-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness.\nThe ﬁrst consciousness gained by the soul was obviously most-\nﬁnite in pro p o rtion to the experience of absolute opposites of its\nown original, inﬁnite state as in “A. ”\nC o n s e q u e n t l y, it then means that in the beginning when the\ni m p ressionless, inﬁnite soul was ﬁrst impressioned, such ﬁrst im-\np ression was an absolutely most-ﬁnite gross impression. The ﬁr s t\nconsciousness it (soul, a t m a) derived was most ﬁnite. Naturally , at\nthat instant, the unconsciousness of the inﬁnite soul actually ex-\nperienced a most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness of the most-gross ﬁ r s t\nimpression.\nThe T en States of God 173\nNow if the soul is conscious of impressions (sanskaras), t h e n\nthe soul must necessarily experience these impressions. And in\norder to experience the impressions, the consciousness of the soul\nmust experience them through proper and suitable media. As the\ni m p ressions are, so are the experiences of the impressions, and\nl i k ewise so are the proper media to experience the impr e s s i o n s .\nThat is to say , the impressions give rise to experiences, and to ex-\nperience the impressions, the use of appropriate media is essential.\nT h e re f o re, as the infinite, eternal and formless soul has now\ngotten the most-finite first consciousness of the most-gross first\ni mp ression, most obviously and necessarily this ﬁrst consciousness\nof the soul must utilize the most-finite and the most-gross first\nmedium to experience the most-gross ﬁrst impression.\nThis ﬁrst medium adopted by God in His State IV (God as em-\nbodied soul) is a ﬁrst form which, although it is gross, yet it is so\ni n c o n c e i v a b l y, infinitely finite that it cannot even be consider e d\nas g ross. It is so very inﬁnitely shapeless and substanceless, mat-\nterless and formless, that it cannot lead one even to imagine that\nit is gross. Yet this form is the very first gross form that emer g e s\nsimultaneously as if in three prongs, as the ﬁrst three of the fore-\nmost seven “gas-like” f o rms. If a description of these ﬁrst three gas-\nlike forms could ever be attempted, they could only be described\nf rom the standpoint of density—the first having infinitely negli-\ngible density , then in the next stage negligible density , and in the\nt h i rd stage as having the first traces of density . These first thr e e\nf o rms have no evolution. The next three forms may come within the\nscope of our imagination and may be described as “semi-gaseous\nand semi-material” forms. Evolution begins with the fourth gas-like\nf o rm. And ﬁn a l l y, there is the seventh gas-like form, of the series\nof seven foremost gas-like forms, which is hydrogen, and which\nmay be said to include the electro n .\nIt should be noted well that the first six gas-like gross for m s\nbear no resemblance to the various gases such as hydrogen, nitro-\ngen, and so forth. They are much, much ﬁner (not subtler) * t h a n\nthose with which the scientists of the age are well conversant.\n174 God Speaks\n* This is in no way to be connected with any form or object of the subtle world, be-\ncause these forms are solely of the gross world.\nState V\nGod as Soul in the State of Evolution\nGod as embodied soul now begins to become conscious and\nbegins to “know” the Creation (the Nothingness), although His\n“knowing” of the Creation at this stage is inﬁnitely negligible. Even\nthis most ﬁnite consciousness and this minutest “knowing,” how-\ne v e r, creates more impressions (sanskaras) that cause the “dro p ”\n(soul, atma, s e lf) to leave or dissociate from the original ﬁrst bubble\n( f o rm). Leaving the bubble is equivalent to a dropping off of, or\ndissociating from, the ﬁrst form.\nEven after the form is dropped, the impressions gathered by the\nevolving consciousness of the soul do not vanish. These impr e s-\nsions remain associated with the evolved consciousness and cause\nthe evolving consciousness of the soul to associate with another ap-\np ropriate and superior bubble (form). The soul is thus able to\nknow or experience more of the Creation through the second form .\nThe “angle of vision” widens and the consciousness of “knowing”\ni n c reases in pr o p o rtion to the simultaneous evolution of for m .\nWith the evolution or growth in gross consciousness the impr e s-\nsions (sanskaras) also increase and cause the soul to assume or as-\nsociate with a still more complex gross form in accordance with the\nimpressions retained by the consciousness when the second gross\nform is abandoned.\nIn this way the evolution of consciousness pro g resses for ages,\nc o n c u rrently with the evolution of forms which help to experience,\nand concurrently exhaust, the impressions gathered, until after\ncountless changes of forms, through more concrete and successive\nstages of stones, metals, plants, worms, ﬁshes, birds and animals,\nthe soul takes on the human form.\nIn other words, the cycle of evolution of consciousness of soul\ncontinues evolving further and greater consciousness with the evo-\nlution of forms of higher and higher types, while experiencing a n d\nexhausting the impressions of the dissociated forms of the next\nlower type.\nConsequently the evolution of consciousness of souls appar-\nently tends the souls to identify themselves with, and gather varied\ninnumerable impressions of, higher and higher gross species of\nThe Ten States of God 175\nf o rms, unlimited in number, in the gross world. The clean-cut\nmajor forms with which the souls associate, with every leap of\ng reater and greater consciousness, are in accordance with the leaps\nf rom stone to metal, from metal to plant, from plant to worm, fro m\nw o rm to ﬁsh, from ﬁsh to bird, from bird to animal, and ultimately\nthe last and seventh leap is from animal to human form.\nIt is very important to understand that the process of evolution\nof consciousness concerns the evolution of bubbles or forms only,\nand not the “drops” or the souls. The souls remain as indivisible\nand inﬁnite as the unlimited ocean ( P a r a m a t m a )f rom the begin-\nning until the end of evolution of consciousness, which term i n a t e s\nwith the completion of evolution of form.\nOnly through this evolution of form does the consciousness\nof ignorance, or the “knowing” of Creation, increase step by step\ndue to varied impressions; and only in the human form can the in-\ndividualized soul ( a t m a )eventually realize the Over-Soul or P a r a m-\natma. As the soul is inﬁnite, the consciousness of the soul must also\nbecome infinite; and because consciousness can become infinite\nonly in human form, the human form is there f o re the ﬁn a lstage of\nevolution of form.\nThe soul has to pass through eight million, four hundred thou-\nsand (eighty-four l a k h s) human forms after it has once commenced\nto r e i n c a rnate in the human form until it has attained God-\nrealization. The prehuman forms through which it has to pass be-\nfore it can incarnate in the human form are innumerable.\nStrictly speaking there is only one form—the human for m —\nwhich is latent in all of the previous forms. The mineral, the plant\nand the animal forms actually contain the human form in its latent\nstate, and this is gradually and increasingly manifested until it is at\nlast completely expressed as a human being in a human body .\nB e f o re the human form becomes completely manifested in a\nhuman body , such as a man or a woman, the latent human form\nmakes a series of partial turns. In the crystalline rock state (such as\ngranite) the latent human form is completely upside down, and is\nalmost so in the plant state as well. As the forms pro g ress or evolve,\nthe axis of the body rotates slowly , so that it becomes more and\n176 God Speaks\nm o re horizontal; and when we reach the higher vertebrates, we ﬁn d\nthe head rising up more and more, as the axis of the body ap-\nproaches the vertical. In men and women we ﬁnd the human form\ncompletely expressed and completely vertical.\nThe details of this evolution of form are extremely complex.\nT h e re are, for example, certain species of stone, metal, plant and\nanimal that have what Meher Baba described as a special “seat” in\nevolution. These key species of forms are mostly those that are mile-\nstones on the evolutionary road, and they mark the first and the\nlast of a certain general class of species of forms. For example, the\nﬁrst species of bird-form to follow the last species of ﬁsh-form and\nthe ﬁrst species of the animal-form to follow the last species of the\nbird-form have a special “seat” signiﬁcance in evolution.\nMeher Baba tells us that this whole theme has been explained\ndown to the last detail in his own book * that is still to be handed\nover to the world.\nJust as there is evolution of consciousness and evolution of\nforms, so also there is evolution of the worlds.\nThe evolved consciousness of the soul, identifying the soul with\nevolved forms, gets more and more impressioned; and in order t o\nexhaust these impressions, it consistently ﬁnds its ﬁeld of expre s-\nsion; and it experiences these impressions on the earth, which is\nalso evolving concurrently with other worlds in accordance with\nthe progressive evolution of the entire cosmic Creation.\nDuring the course of evolution of consciousness of the soul,\nthe soul, while consciously identifying itself with varied, finite\ng ross forms, was also simultaneously , though u n c o n s c i o u s l y, i d e n-\ntifying itself with its ﬁnite subtle form and its ﬁnite mental for m ,\nwhich associated with the soul (atma) in compact, homogeneous,\nunconscious association throughout the course of evolution of con-\nsciousness, right from the ﬁrst urge.\nDuring the whole course of the evolution of consciousness\nwhile the soul frequently and consciously dissociates itself fr o m\nThe Ten States of God 177\n* [The book re f e rred to should not be confused with this publication. Meher Baba\nhas authored an additional work, which might be published later. Ed.]\nthe ﬁnite gross forms, which act as media to experience and exhaust\nthe impressions while evolving greater and greater consciousness,\nthe soul never dissociates itself, consciously or unconsciously , fro m\nits ﬁnite subtle form and its ﬁnite mental form .\nOn the contrary , when the soul dissociates its identiﬁ c a t i o n\nwith any one medium of ﬁnite gross form, it is the unconscious as-\nsociation of the soul with its subtle form that for t i ﬁes the soul,\nthen without any gross medium, with ﬁnite energy—the driving\nf o rce—to tend the consciousness of the soul towards identifying it-\nself with yet another form, i.e., the next medium of the next ﬁnite\ng ross form, to experience the impressions of the last dissociated ﬁ-\nnite gross form, retained and r e ﬂected by the ﬁnite mental form\nof the soul, which is also in unconscious association with the soul.\nIt is only natural that together with the evolution of gr e a t e r\nand g reater consciousness of the soul, the evolution of the finite\nsubtle form of the soul also takes place to fortify the soul with\ng reater finite energy to tend the consciousness of the more and\nm o re gross-conscious soul to identify itself with higher and higher\ntypes of finite gross forms evolved by the impressions of the last\nlower and ﬁnite gross form.\nS i m i l a r l y, the evolution of the finite mental form of the soul\nalso takes place simultaneously to accommodate, retain and re-\nﬂect the increasingly innumerable, varied impressions gained and\ng a t he red by the evolution of greater and greater consciousness of\nthe soul.\nThus it is that only in a human form are the subtle body and the\nmental body fully developed. Hence the soul, associating itself con-\nsciously with human form is, so to speak, fully equipped with gro s s\nb o d y, subtle body and mental body in human form, together with\nthe full consciousness of the gross gained in the human for m .\nN e v e rtheless, although the soul has gained full consciousness\nin human form and so experiences the gross world, yet the gro s s -\nconscious human soul is unconscious of the subtle body and there-\nf o re cannot experience the subtle world; the gross-conscious human\nsoul is also unconscious of the mental body and ther e f o re cannot\nexperience the mental world.\n178 God Speaks\nState VI\nGod as Human Soul in the State of Reincarnation*\nThe most-ﬁnite ﬁrst impression of the ﬁrst urge gave to the in-\nfinite unconsciousness of the unconscious soul the most-finite\nfirst consciousness. Gradually , varied and innumerable impr e s-\nsions, experienced through varied and innumerable gross media,\ngained greater and greater consciousness of the ﬁnite gross world\nfor the soul, and eventually the evolution of consciousness was\ncomplete when the consciousness of the soul identiﬁed itself with\nthe most-ﬁrst human form. There f o re the soul, having now gained\nfull consciousness in human form, does not need any more or any\nother higher forms to evolve consciousness. The consciousness\ngradually gained in the process of evolution is full and complete in\nhuman form .\nThough the soul in this state has gained full and completec o n-\nsciousness, it is still not conscious of its subtle and mental bodies\nnor of its unlimited Self as One—indivisible, eternal and inﬁ n i t e ;\nit is only fully conscious of its identity with human form and its\nvaried aspects and experiences of the gross world.\nConsequently the soul at this stage, only fully gross-conscious\nof the most-first human gross form, and still unconscious of the\nsubtle and mental, experiences in the gross world all of the im-\np ressions of the most-last animal gross form dissociated or dro p p e d\nby the consciousness of the soul in the latest stage of evolution of\nconsciousness.\nWhen all of the impressions of the most-last animal gross form\na re exhausted through incessant experiences by the most-first\nhuman gross form, then it is but natural that this most-ﬁrst human\nform is dropped or dissociated from the consciousness of the soul.\nThis experience by the fully conscious soul is universally accepted\nas the death of the human being. As explained pre v i o u s l y, although\nthe consciousness of the soul gets dissociated from the most-ﬁ r s t\nhuman form, yet it can never get dissociated from the unconscious\nassociations of its subtle and mental bodies.\nThe Ten States of God 179\n* [See also Meher Baba, “Reincarnation and Karma,” Discourses, 301–338. Ed.]\nThe consciousness of the soul retains and experiences the im-\np ressions of the dropped or dissociated most-first human form\nt h rough its subtle and mental bodies. In order to exhaust these im-\np ressions the consciousness of the soul must necessarily associ-\nate with a gross form; and ther e f o re, it associates itself with the\nnext human form to exhaust and experience the residual impr e s-\nsions of the previous human form dropped. In fact this next human\nf o rm is nothing but the consolidated mould of the past impre s s i o n s\nretained of the previous body or human form that dissociated fro m\nthe conscious soul. The association of consciousness of the soul\nwith the next human form is universally accepted as the birth of\na human being.\nIn short, in State VI of God as human soul in the state of re-\ni n c a rnation, the soul has developed full consciousness in human\nf o rm, and there f o re there is no need for any further evolution of the\ng ross form. The evolution of gross consciousness thus comes to an\nend with the attainment of the human form; and to experience the\ni m p ressions (sanskaras) cultivated in the human and the sub-\nhuman forms, the soul has to incarnate again and again into the\nhuman form.\nThe kind of human forms with which the consciousness of the\nsoul has to associate is determined by the nature of previous im-\np ressions (sanskaras) of virtue or vice, happiness or misery , and so\nf o rth. While experiencing the gross world, the soul identifies itself\nwith the gross body, which is destructible, although the soul itself\nis eternal.\nIn the sub-human stage the evolutionary process of form and\nconsciousness is involuntary , yet sustained and continuous, with\nno possibility of slipping down to the lower forms of evolution. I n\nthe human stage, which marks the end of the evolution of form and\nthe attainment of full consciousness, the spiritual pro g ress of man,\nt h rough the re i n c a rnation and realization processes, is voluntary ,\nand is also absolutely free from any danger whatsoever of slipping\ndown to a sub-human state except in ﬂagrant misuse of the powers\nof the fourth plane. Once full consciousness is gained, it is gained\nf o rever and is never lost; and the evolution of consciousness is\n180 God Speaks\ncompleted only when the consciousness of the soul associates it-\nself with human form. There f o re re t rograde incarnation is an im-\npossibility once the consciousness of the soul identiﬁes itself with\na human form.\nWith the development of full consciousness of the gross world\nin the human gross body, the soul simultaneously is associated\nwith the fully developed subtle and mental bodies. But as long as\nconsciousness is conﬁned to the gross world, the consciousness\nof the soul cannot make use of its subtle and mental bodies dire c t l y.\nThe soul becomes conscious of these bodies and experiences the\nc o rresponding impressions of these bodies through the corre-\nsponding s p h e res of the subtle and mental worlds only when full\nconsciousness, which is conscious only of the gross at this stage,\nt u rns inwards toward itself and the process of the involution of\nc o nsciousness begins. This becomes possible only when the con-\ns c i o u sness of the individualized soul becomes satiated with the in-\ncessant experiences of the varied and innumerable impressions of\nthe material or gross life, and only when it has suff e red oscillations\nbetween the opposites of pain and pleasure, for what may seem in-\nt e rminable ages, through the unfailing chain of births and deaths\nin the process of r e i n c a rnation. In the stage of evolution of con-\nsciousness the “winding process” of impressions (sanskaras) is at\nwork with a view to evolving consciousness, developing higher and\nhigher types of gross forms. In the human stage the fully evolved\nconsciousness remains, but the grip of impressions (sanskaras) b e-\ngins to loosen and thin out as a result of continuous jolts experi-\nenced by the consciousness of the soul through the seemingly\nunending chain of births and deaths in the re i n c a rnation pro c e s s .\nState VII\nGod in the State of Spiritually Advanced Souls\nAfter a long drawn out struggle with the life of the gross senses\nin the gross world, the consciousness of the soul begins to get\ndrawn towards the Self of the soul rather than to remain focussed\non the gross body and its gross environment. After a number of\nThe T en States of God 181\nb i rths and deaths the gross-conscious human soul is at last in-\nevitably drawn to embark upon the process which will lead the\nman ultimately to the goal of God-realization in human form.\nThe consciousness of the soul therefore begins to withdraw it-\nself from the world of gross senses and is now ready to undergo the\np rocess of involution. The soul is thus said to advance spiritually\nthrough the subtle and mental spheres.\nThe subtle sphere, or the subtle world, is the domain of the ﬁr s t\nthree planes of the involving consciousness of the soul; the fourth\nplane lies between the subtle sphere and the mental sphere; and the\nmental sphere contains the ﬁfth and sixth planes.\nThis"

The\ng reater the advance, the greater the involution of consciousness.\nWhen the soul becomes conscious of the subtle sphere thro u g h\nthe subtle body , it identiﬁes itself with the subtle body; and when\nit is conscious of the mental sphere through the mental body , it\ni d e n t i ﬁes itself with the mental body , just as it identiﬁed itself with\nthe gross body when it was conscious of the gross sphere through the\ngross body .\nThe spiritual pro g ress of the soul through these spheres is en-\nt i rely in imagination. The pilgrim’s pr o g ress in the involution of\nhis consciousness consists in replacing one realm of imagination\nfor a better and higher level of imagination, right from the first\nt h rough the sixth plane of involving consciousness. In the seventh\nplane the involving process is complete, imagination comes to an\nend and Reality is realized and is no longer a concept.\nThose who enter the spiritual path and tread upon it without\nthe help of a Master to guide them very often get lost in the laby-\nrinths of sights and illuminations, and have little or no chance of\nredeeming themselves from that position. They are like childr e n\nwho, on their way to school, get distracted by the sights and at-\ntractions of the market place.\nThe enchantment on the spiritual path is so great and the en-\nticement so intense that even in the earlier stages of the journey the\npilgrim has a pseudo-sense of God-realization from which he cannot\n182 God Speaks\ne m e rge unless helped by Perfect Masters. Many an advanced pil-\ngrim in the subtle sphere thinks that he has gained complete free-\ndom from births and deaths—although this is not so. The delusion\nremains up to the sixth plane of involving consciousness, but it is\nmost conspicuous between the third and fourth planes. The fourt h\nplane of consciousness is the most tr e a c h e rous stage in the pil-\ng r i m ’s pro g ress, because this is the stage when all the powers of the\ni n ﬁnite Energy of the subtle sphere are under his direct comm a n d .\nThe misuse of these powers means the downfall and disintegration\nof the consciousness of the soul. Though it is a fundamental fact\nthat once consciousness is gained it can never be lost, yet an ex-\nception to this rule can occur, but only at the fourth plane w h e re\nt h e re is a good possibility of the consciousness gained by the soul\nbeing disintegrated. While it is never lost completely, it disinte-\ngrates as far back as the consciousness of the stone-form. The whole\np rocess of evolution of consciousness then has to be repeated to re-\ngain the full consciousness and the human form.\nThus it is that from the fourth plane the pilgrim on the spiri-\ntual path may either fall back due to the abuse or wrong use of\nt ajalliyat (siddhis), or pro g ress by further involution of his con-\nsciousness to fifth plane consciousness, and capture the experi-\nence of the mental sphere or the mental world. Crossing the fourt h\nplane and stepping into the ﬁfth would mean gaining approach to\nthe Divine Gate!\nIn the sixth plane the pilgrim “sees” God face to face. This see-\ning is through the mental eye when the consciousness of the soul\nidentifies the soul with the mental body . Even when the pilgrim\nsees God face to face in the sixth plane of his involving con-\nsciousness, the grip of duality is not overcome, because the seer\nand the seen are still differentiated through the seeing.\nImagination on the planes ceases as soon as the pilgrim cro s s e s\nthe ﬁeld of Illusion and enters the realm of Reality in the seventh\nplane of completely involved consciousness, where he is absolutely\nf ree of all traces of impressions. The seventh plane consciousness is\nfull, as well as mature, and is the impressionless consciousness w h i c h\ni d e n t i ﬁes the soul with its “Self.” The soul then feels and experiences\nThe Ten States of God 183\nconsciously its eternal existence as God. The “drop” (soul), devoid\nof any bubble (form of ignorance in Illusion), realizes its eter n a l\nexistence in the inﬁnite ocean, as the ocean itself (the Paramatma o r\nthe Over- S o u l ) .\nState VIII\nGod as the Divinely Absorbed\nThis state of God signiﬁes for the soul the end of the long evo-\nl u t i o n a ry struggle, the end of the r e i n c a rnation process and the\nend of the realization process through the planes. For the individ-\nual soul there is no higher stage toward which to aspire, because\nit has reached the goal by becoming one with God. The God-\nrealized pilgrim of this stage is known to the Suﬁ world as a M a j-\nzoob and the Vedantist calls him a Brahmi Bhoot. The Majzoob has\nno body-consciousness and no consciousness of the three sphere s ,\nthe gross, the subtle and the mental. This means that in this State\nVIII, God as Majzoob consciously experiences His own infinite\nt r i o - n a t u re of infinite power, knowledge and bliss, but does not\nmake use of these inﬁnite aspects of His nature.\nIn this State VIII, the unconscious, inﬁnite state A of God (the\nunconscious P a r a m a t m a) not only gains the highest divine con-\nsciousness of state B of God (the conscious P a r a m a t m a) but in this\nstate God becomes divinely absorbed in the reality of His own in-\nﬁnite, conscious state, and thus realizes His eternal identity with\nthe inﬁnite, conscious state B of God.\nThis State VIII of God is of the highest divine consciousness,\nwhich is the ahadiyat (halat-e-Muhammadi) or the vidnyan.

Whether God is in the state\nof Man-God, as Perfect Master, or in the state of God-Man, as Ava-\nt a r, He is in this tenth state and functions as a Man-God and as a\nGod-Man from the divine office muqam-e-Muhammadi or v i d-\nnyan bhumika, depicted in the chart as “C.” The first manifestation\nof God, with His inﬁnite consciousness, assumed this divine ofﬁc e ,\nand this ofﬁce will ever continue to function eternally to radiate in-\nﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss, which the Perfect Masters and\nthe Avatar not only eternally experience, but also use for the eman-\ncipation of all souls who are still in the grip of ignorance, tr y i n g\n186 God Speaks\nto gain consciousness of their eternal state of oneness with the\nOver-Soul.\nIn other words, God in a human body will everlastingly mani-\nfest Himself in all of His perfection only through this divine ofﬁce\nmarked “C” in the chart “The Ten States of God.”\nIt was only through this divine ofﬁce that God, as God-Man, in\nthe form of Zoroaster, Rama, Krishna, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad\nand others, manifested Himself and proclaimed in every cycle,\nage after age, that He is the Saviour, the Prophet, the Messiah, the\nSon-of-God, the Av a t a r, the Rasool, the Buddha and so forth. And\nit is only through this divine ofﬁce that the ﬁve Perfect Masters or\nthe Qutubs or the S a d g u rus function as the summum bonum of the\nwhole cosmic Cre a t i o n .\nThe Suﬁs call this divine ofﬁce “muqam-e-Muhammadi,” a f t e r\nthe name of the Prophet Muhammad, the Rasool of God, in His\nhaqiqat-e-Muhammadi. S i m i l a r l y, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God,\nis—like Muhammad, Zoro a s t e r, Krishna, Rama, Buddha—the God-\nMan; whilst “Christ,” like haqiqat-e-Muhammadi, is the divine state\nof Jesus.\nWhen we try to put together all the diff e rent stages of God in a\nnutshell, ﬁve distinct stages, in the travail of the unconscious P a r a m-\natma to gain complete consciousness, become conspicuous.\nThe First Stage\n1. To begin with, atma (soul) and Paramatma ( O v e r-Soul) are\nboth one in the inﬁnite, indivisible “Oneness of Reality .”\n2. B e f o re the beginning of the Beginning, Paramatma and all a t m a s\nwere unconscious and unimpressioned.\n3. In the beginning, atma had no consciousness of the gross body ,\nsubtle body or mental body , and there f o re had no experience of\nthe gross world, the subtle world or the mental world. A t m a\nwas even unconscious of its own Self and therefore had no ex-\nperience of its own Paramatma state.\nThis is the stage depicted as state A in the chart of the T e n\nStates of God.\nThe T en States of God 187\nThe Second Stage\nA t m agains consciousness and has impressions. At this stage\na t m ais conscious either of the gross body or the subtle body or the\nmental body and experiences either the gross world or the subtle\nworld or the mental world; but a t m ais still unconscious of its own\nSelf and therefore does not experience the Paramatma state yet.\nThis is the stage as in States III, IV , V , VIand VII a c c o rding to\nthe chart.\nThe Third Stage\nA t m abecomes impressionless but retains full and complete con-\nsciousness. This complete consciousness is now no longer of the\ngross body, the subtle body or the mental body, and therefore atma\nno longer experiences the gross world, the subtle world or the men-\ntal world.\nThis consciousness that is retained is of a t m a ’s own infinite\nSelf, and there f o re atma now experiences the P a r a m a t m astate con-\nsciously and experiences the inﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss of\nthe “I am God” state.\nThis is the stage noted as State VIII in the chart.\nThe Fourth Stage\nAtma recovers the so-called normal consciousness of the gross\nb o d y, the subtle body and the mental body and there f o re once again\nexperiences, at one and the same time, the gross world, the subtle\nworld and the mental world. At this stage, atma is simultaneously\nalso conscious of its own inﬁnite Self and experiences the inﬁn i t e\npower, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss of its own Paramatma\nstate, but a t m acannot use these infinite attributes even though,\nat this stage, it is conscious of its gross, subtle and mental bodies\nand experiences simultaneously the three worlds.\nThis is the stage of State IX in the chart.\n188 God Speaks\nThe Fifth Stage\nA t m ais fully and completely conscious of the gross body , the\nsubtle body and the mental body , and experiences the gross world,\nthe subtle world and the mental world simultaneously with having\nthe highest divine consciousness of its infinite Self, and also ex-\nperiences and uses the inﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and in-\nﬁnite bliss of its own Paramatma state.\nThis is the stage of State X as shown in the chart of the T en States\nof God.*\nThe Ten States of God 189\n* [A summary by Meher Baba of different terms for status, state, stage or aspect and\ngnosis in the eternal sphere of Reality appears on pages 2 7 8 – 2 7 9. The gnosis of “I\nam God” is common to each one of the four types of perfection and does not end\non physical death. Ed.]"

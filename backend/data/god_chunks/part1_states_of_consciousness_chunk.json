They are formless. \nAll souls are One; there is no difference in souls or in their being\nand existence as souls.\nThere is a difference in the consciousness of souls; \nthere is a difference in the planes of consciousness of souls; \nthere is a difference in the experience of souls and thus \nthere is a difference in the state of souls.\nMost souls are conscious of the gross body (sthul sharir);\nsome souls are conscious of the subtle body (pran); \na few souls are conscious of the mental body (mind or mana);\nand \na very few souls are conscious of Self.\nMost souls have experience of the gross sphere (world); \nsome souls have experience of the subtle sphere (world); \na few souls have experience of the mental sphere (world); and \na very few souls have experience of the Over-Soul.\nMost souls are on the gross plane (anna bhumika); \nsome souls are on the subtle plane (pran bhumika); \na few souls are on the mental plane (mano bhumika); and \na very few souls are on the plane beyond the mental plane \n(vidnyan).\n1\n\n† SPHERE BODY\nMystic Mystic Suﬁ Vedantic\nGross Sphere Gross Body Jism-e-Kasif Sthul Sharir\n(World)\nSubtle Sphere Subtle Body Jism-e-Latif Sukshma Sharir\n(World) (Pran)\nMental Sphere Mental Body Jism-e-Altaf Karan Sharir\n(World) (Manas)\nMost souls have great binding; some souls have little bind-\ning; a few souls have very little binding; and a very few souls have\nabsolutely no binding.\nAll these souls (atmas) of diff e rent consciousness, of diff e re n t\nexperiences, of different states are in the Over-Soul (Paramatma).\nIf, now , all souls are in the Over-Soul and are all One, then why\nis there any diff e rence in the consciousness, in the planes, in the\nexperiences and in the states?\nThe cause of this difference is that the souls have different and\ndiverse impressions (sanskaras).*\nMost souls have g ross i m p ressions; some souls have subtle i m-\np ressions; a few souls have m e n t a li m p ressions; and a very few\nsouls have no impressions at all.\nSouls having gross impressions, souls having subtle impr e s-\nsions, souls having mental impressions and souls having no im-\npressions, are all souls in the Over-Soul and all are One.\nSouls with gross impressions have consciousness of the gr o s s\nbody (sthul sharir) and have experience of the gross sphere.\nSouls with subtle impressions have consciousness of the subtle\nbody (pran) and have experience of the subtle sphere.\nSouls with mental impressions have consciousness of the\nmental body (mana or mind) and have the experience of the men-\ntal sphere .†\nS\nouls with no impressions have consciousness of Self (soul,\natma) and have the experience of the Over-Soul (Paramatma).\n2 God Speaks\n* [See also Meher Baba, “The Formation and Function of S a n s k a r a s ,”Discourses, 7t h\ned. (Myrtle Beach, SC: Sheriar Press, 1987), 32–39. Ed.]\n\nThus souls with gross impressions experience the gross sphere\nt h rough the gross body; that is, they experience dif f e rent and di-\nverse experiences such as seeing, hearing, smelling, eating, sleep-\ning, clearing the bowels and urinating. All these are experiences of\nthe gross sphere.\nSouls with subtle impressions experience successively thr e e\nplanes of the subtle sphere through the subtle body , and in these\nt h ree planes they have only the experiences of seeing, smelling\nand hearing.\nSouls with mental impressions, through the mental body or\nmind, in the mental sphere experience only seeing, and this seeing\nis the seeing of God.\nSouls having no impressions, through the Self experience the in-\nﬁnite power, inﬁnite knowledge and inﬁnite bliss of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that is conscious of the gross body is n o tconscious of\nthe subtle body , n o tconscious of the mental body , and n o tc o n-\nscious of Self.\nThe soul that is conscious of the subtle body is n o tc o n s c i o u s\nof the gross body , n o tconscious of the mental body , and n o tc o n-\nscious of Self.\nThe soul that is conscious of the mental body is not conscious\nof the gross body , n o tconscious of the subtle body , and n o tc o n-\nscious of Self.\nThe soul that is conscious of Self is not conscious of the gross\nb o d y, not conscious of the subtle body , and not conscious of the\nmental body .\nThe soul that has experience of the gross world does not have\ne xperience of the subtle world, nor experience of the mental world,\nnor does it have experience of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that has experience of the subtle world does not expe-\nrience the gross world, nor does it have experience of the mental\nworld, nor does it have experience of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that has experience of the mental world does not ex-\nperience the gross world, nor does it experience the subtle world,\nnor does it have experience of the Over- S o u l .\nThe soul that has experience of the Over-Soul does note x p e r i-\nence the gross world, nor does it experience the subtle world, nor\nStates of Consciousness 3\n\ndoes it experience the mental world. That is, the soul that is con-\nscious of Self and has experience of the Over-Soul is not conscious\nof the gross body , subtle body and mental body and does not expe-\nrience the gross, subtle and mental spheres (worlds).\nThis means that in order to have consciousness of Self and to\nhave the experience of the Over-Soul, the soul must lose conscious-\nness of the gross, subtle and mental bodies. But as long as the soul\nis impressioned either by the gross, subtle or mental impre s s i o n s ,\nthe soul consistently and respectively has consciousness of the gro s s\nb o d y, subtle body or mental body , and the gross, subtle and men-\ntal experiences are persistently and necessarily underg o n e .\nThe obvious reason for this is that as long as the consciousness\nof the soul is impressed by gross impressions, there is no way out ex-\ncept to experience these gross impressions through the gross body .\nSimilarly, as long as the consciousness of the soul is impressed\nby subtle impressions, there is no way out but to experience these\nsubtle impressions through the subtle body .\nSimilarly, as long as the consciousness of the soul is impressed\nby mental impressions, there is no escape but to experience these\nmental impressions through the mental body .\nAs impressions of the gross, subtle and mental vanish or com-\npletely disappear, the consciousness of the soul is automatically and\nobviously directed and focussed towards itself, and this soul then nec-\nessarily has no alternative but to absorb experience of the Over- S o u l .\nN o w, gross, subtle and mental bodies are nothing but the s h a d-\nows of the soul. The gross, subtle and mental spheres (worlds) are\nnothing but the shadows of the Over-Soul.\nG ross, subtle and mental bodies are ﬁnite, have forms and are\nchangeable and destructible. The gross, subtle and mental worlds\na re false; they are zero, imagination and vacant dreams. The only re-\nality is the Over-Soul ( P a r a m a t m a ) .\nT h e re f o re when the soul with its gross, subtle and mental bod-\nies experiences the gross, subtle and mental worlds, the soul actually\nexperiences in reality the shadows of the Over-Soul with the help\nof its own shadows.\nIn other words, the soul with its ﬁnite and destructible form ex-\nperiences falsity , zero, imagination and a vacant dream.\n4 God Speaks\n\nOnly when the soul experiences the Over-Soul with its Self\ndoes it experience the Real with reality .\nWhen the soul is conscious of its gross body , then this soul iden-\nt i ﬁes itself with the gross body and takes itself as the gross body .\nThis means that the inﬁnite, eternal, formless soul ﬁnds itself\nas ﬁnite, mortal and having form.\nImpressions (sanskaras) are the cause of this ignorance. In the\nbeginning the soul, which is eternally in the Over-Soul, at first\na cq u i res ignorance through impressions rather than acquiring\nKnowledge.\nWhen the soul acquires a particular form (body or s h a r i r) a c-\ncording to particular impressions, it feels and experiences itself as\nbeing that particular form.\nSoul in its stone-form experiences itself as stone. Accordingly ,\nin due course, the soul experiences and feels that it is metal, vege-\ntable, worm, ﬁsh, bird, animal, man or woman. Whatever be thet y p e\nof gross form and whatever be the shape of the form, the soul spon-\ntaneously associates itself with that form, ﬁg u re and shape, and ex-\nperiences that it is itself that form, ﬁgure and shape.\nWhen the soul is conscious of the subtle body , then this soul\nexperiences that it is the subtle body .\nWhen the soul becomes conscious of the mental body , then this\nsoul experiences that it is the mental body .\nIt is only because of impressions (nuqush-e-amal or s a n s k a r a s )\nthat the soul without form, the Inﬁnite Soul, experiences that it is\nveritably a g ross body (sthul sharir), or a subtle body (pran) or a\nmental body (mana or mind).\nThe soul, while experiencing the gross world through gr o s s\nf o rms, associates with and dissociates from innumerable gr o s s\nf o rms. The association with and dissociation from gross forms are\ntermed birth and death respectively .\nIt is only because of impressions that the eternal, immor t a l\nsoul, existing in reality without births and without deaths, has to\nexperience births and deaths innumerable times.\nWhile the soul has to undergo this experience of innumerable\nb i rths and deaths because of impressions, it has not only to experi-\nence the gross world, which is a shadow of the Over-Soul and which\nStates of Consciousness 5\n\nis false, but together with it the soul has also to experience the hap-\npiness and misery , virtue and vice of the gross world.\nIt is only because of impressions that the soul, which is beyond\nand free from happiness and misery , virtue and vice, has necessarily\nto undergo experiences of misery and happiness, vice and virt u e .\nNow this much is established, that the experiences of bir t h s\nand deaths, happiness and misery , virtue and vice are experienced\nonly by the gross form of the soul while experiencing the gr o s s\nworld; but the gross form of the soul is a shadow of the soul and\nthe gross world is a shadow of the Over-Soul.\nThus all the experiences of births and deaths, virtue and vice,\nhappiness and misery experienced by the soul are nothing but the\nexperiences of the shadow . Hence all that is thus experienced is false.\nAtma in Reality Is Paramatma\nIn order to clarify the relationship of “atma-Paramatma” we com-\np a re Paramatma with an inﬁnite ocean, a limitless ocean, and the\natma as a drop in this ocean. The atma i snever out of this limitless\nocean ( P a r a m a t m a ) .\nThe atma can never be out of Paramatma because Paramatma i s\ni n ﬁnite and unlimited. How can the atma come out of, or have a\nplace beyond, the limitlessness of the limitless? There f o re the a t m a\nis in P a r a m a t m a .\nAfter establishing the primary fact that the atma is i nP a r a m-\natma we go a step further and say that atma i sParamatma. H o w ?\nFor example, let us imagine an unlimited ocean. Let us also\nimagine that we separate or take out one iota of ocean from the lim-\nitless expanse of this unlimited ocean. It follows then that this iota\nof ocean, while in the limitless ocean, before separation is ocean\ni tself, and is not there in the shoreless ocean as an iota of the ocean,\nbecause every iota of ocean, when not limited by the limitations\nof a drop, is unlimited ocean.\nIt is only when an iota of ocean is separated from the unlim-\nited ocean, or is taken out of the unlimited ocean as a drop, that this\niota of ocean obtains its separate existence as a drop of the shore l e s s\n6 God Speaks\n\nocean, and that this iota of ocean begins to be looked upon as a dro p\nof the unlimited ocean.\nIn other words, the inﬁnite, unlimited and limitless ocean itself\nis now looked upon as merely a drop of that inﬁnite, unlimited and\nlimitless ocean. And in comparison to that inﬁnite, unlimited and\nlimitless ocean this iota of ocean, or this drop of the iota of ocean,\nis most ﬁnite and most limited with inﬁnite limitations. That is, the\ninﬁnitely free iota ﬁnds itself inﬁnitely bound.\nS i m i l a r l y, the atma, which we have compared with a drop of\nthe inﬁnite ocean, obtains a seeming separate existence, though in\nreality it can never be out of the limitlessness of the limitless, inﬁn i t e\nParamatma which we have compared with the inﬁnite, unlimited\nand limitless ocean.\nBut just as the iota of ocean acquires its limitation as a drop\nt h rough being in the form of a bubble on the surface of the ocean, and\nthe bubble bestows upon the iota of ocean an apparently separative\nexistence from the inﬁnite ocean, likewise the atma, which is i n\nP a r amatma and is Paramatma, a p p a rently experiences separative\nexistence from the inﬁnite Paramatma t h rough the limitations of\na bubble (of ignorance) with which the atma s h rouds itself. No\nsooner does the bubble of ignorance burst, than the atma not only\nﬁnds itself in Paramatma but experiences itself as Paramatma.\nT h rough this limitation, formed by the bubble of ignorance,\ns e l f - c reated by the atma, the atma a p p a rently inherits a separative\nexistence from Paramatma. And because of this self-created sepa-\nrativeness from inﬁnite Paramatma, the atma, which is itself inﬁ-\nnite, unlimited and limitless, apparently experiences itself as most\nﬁnite with inﬁnite limitations.\nStates of Consciousness 7"

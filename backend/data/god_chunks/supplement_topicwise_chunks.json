    "text": "Impressioned Consciousness (27)*\nAt the request of the editors, Meher Baba added the following\ninformation:\nConsciousness is deﬁnitely complete as soon as the ﬁrst human\nf o rm is taken, but it does not start involving at that point. When\nconsciousness ﬁrst begins to involve it means that the human being\nis only beginning to take the ﬁrst step on the spiritual path.\nBetween the time of the ﬁrst human incarnation and the time of\ngoing on the path, the complete consciousness of a human being,\nwhich is still an impressioned consciousness, has necessarily to in-\ndulge in a process that eventually must dislodge these impre s s i o n s\nf rom retaining their hold on it (the consciousness which is complete).\nIt is to be noted that during that period, which covers thou-\nsands of re i n c a rnations, the impressions which were hard-set or\ndense get shaken up so thoroughly by the r e i n c a rnation pro c e s s\nthat their tight grip on consciousness becomes loose. These hard -\nset (dense or gross) impressions thin out or become feeble thro u g h\ninnumerable and varied experiences of opposites. The limit to\nthese experiences is reached by persistent r e i n c a rnations which\ngive experiences of opposites.\nIt is also to be noted that it is only when these dense, hard-set\nor gross impressions become less dense or become feeble, that the\nlimit to the experiences of the gross world through gross impr e s-\nsions is reached by the gross medium, the human body. When the\ndense, hard-set impressions become less dense, they no longer give\nrise to gross experiences because these less dense (feeble) impre s-\nsions are re ﬁned or ﬁne and no longer crude or gross. The aggre g a t e\n192\n* P a renthetical numbers refer to the page number of this book where the supplement\nreference appears.\nof such re ﬁ ned or ﬁ ne impressions is called subtle impr e s s i o n s.\nThese subtle impressions give rise to experiences of the subtle type\n(i . e . ,p e rtaining to the subtle world) and the subtle body experiences\nthese subtle impressions and tries to exhaust them.\nWhen these subtle impressions become even less dense and\nstill more re ﬁ ned, the aggregate of such impressions is called men-\ntal impressions. These mental impressions give rise to experiences\np e rtaining to the mental world, and the mental body experiences\nthese mental impressions and tries to exhaust them.\nWhen the last traces of mental impressions are exhausted\nthrough experiences by the mental body, the complete conscious-\nness of the soul (which was all along in the grip of impr e s s i o n s\nfrom the instant it identiﬁed itself with the most-ﬁrst human-form\nup to the last human-f o rm—which is the mental-conscious human\nb e i n g), is unburdened of impressions. Only such impr e s s i o n l e s s\ncomplete consciousness can realize the ﬁnal experience of the “I\nam God” state of the soul.\nWhen the gross or hard-set impressions get thinned out by\nthe reincarnation process, they become subtle impressions. These\nsubtle impressions can no longer give rise to experiences of the\ng ross world. At this stage the consciousness of t h e gro ss-c o n s c i o u s \nhuman being automatically begins to indulge in experiences of t h e \nsubtle world. This marks t h e advent o f t h e process o f"

    "text": "Practical Mysticism (41)\nApproach to T ruth Is Individual\nT h e re is no general rule or method applicable to all who aspire\nto realize God. Every man must work out his own salvation, and\nmust choose his own method, although his choice is mostly de-\nt e rmined by the total effect of the mind impressions ( s a n s k a r a s )\n2  Practical Mysticism 193\na cq u i red in previous lives. He should be guided by the creed of\nhis conscience, and follow the method that best suits his spiritual\nt e n d e n c y, his physical aptitude and his external cir c u m s t a n c e s .\nTruth is One, but the approach to it is essentially individual. The\nS u ﬁs say , “There are as many ways to God as there are souls of men”\n(Av-vuruqu ilallahi kanufusi bani adam).\nJamal-i ﬁvrat ke lakh partao\nQubul partao ki lakh shaK ij\nTariq-i ’irfaj maij kiya batauj\nYah rah kiski wah rah kiski.\n—Akbar\n“ N a t u re ’s beauty has thousands of facets for which there are\nthousands of ways and means of acceptance (understanding);\nin the Path of Gnosis, who can determine which part i c u l a r\nmode or mood is earmarked for a given individual?”\nRenunciation\nWhen a pilgrim, and by pilgrim we mean here aspirant or dis-\nciple, feels drawn to renunciation, it means that the spirit of re-\nnunciation was already latent in him. This readiness results fr o m\nthe swinging of the terrible pendulum from pain to pleasure and\np l e a s u re to pain, in the countless forms of evolution and in the\ncountless entrances and exits through the doors of birth and death\nexperienced during reincarnation. Because this spirit of renuncia-\ntion is latent, it needs only some exciting cause to bring it to the\ns u rface, and it is only when it comes to the surface that we are able\nto see the power and nature of the latent spirit.\nIf the latent spirit is simply a spiritual indigestion from a tem-\nporary surfeit of pain, combined with a mild desire for something\nm o re pleasant, the overt renunciation will be only of a ﬂeeting and\nfeeble kind, a mere temporary escape from unpleasantness. At its\nbest however, this latent spirit is a secret pact of aggression between\nan incurable disgust for the world and an ardent and burning thirst\nfor God. When it comes to the surface it shows itself as an invin-\ncible determination to marshal the entire being to the attainment\n194 God Speaks Supplement\nof victory over the lower self, and to reject everything that is ir-\nrelevant to this great and terrible struggle. Note this word “reject”;\nit means that such a pilgrim casts aside irrelevancies. We might call\nrenunciation the fruit of the ﬂower of spiritual longing, fer t i l i z e d\nby the pollen of disgust for the futility of endless births and deaths.\nOnce renunciation expresses itself there are many ways of look-\ning at it, of which the simplest is to divide it into two main types,\ninternal and external.\nExternal renunciation means giving up completely all worldly\ndelights and physical attachments to material things. In the early\nstages, this renunciation is helpful to the extent to which it leads\nto internal renunciation and preoccupation with God. Tens of\nthousands of so-called sanyasis ( renunciators) are to be found in\nIndia, of whom far too many have adopted this external renuncia-\ntion only as a profession that enables them to indulge in an un-\np roductive life of idleness. External renunciation, however, can\nbe and often is real. When this is so it will inevitably lead on to\ni n t e rnal renunciation, and this is the renunciation that matters. In-\nt e rnal renunciation means the control of desires at their very sourc e\nso that the mind does not fall a prey to the demands of lust, greed\nand anger. This does not mean that one shall cease at once to have\nsuch thoughts. This is impossible, as such thoughts will continue\nto be troublesome as long as the s a n s k a r a sf rom which they arise\nare part of one’s being. The ﬁght is necessarily hard and long.\nFor the West in part i c u l a r, external renunciation is inadvisable\nand impracticable. It should be internal and of the mind from the\ns t a rt. One should live in the world, per f o rm all legitimate duties\nand yet feel mentally detached from everything. One should be in\nthe world but not of it. The Suﬁs say , “Dil ba yar , dast bikar ”( T h e\nheart with God; the hands for work).\nHazrat Nizamuddin Awliya, the Perfect Master of Delhi, was\nonce asked by a visitor how one should live in the world. At that\nm oment it so happened that a few women were passing by with\npitchers of water balanced on their heads, and, as they walked, they\ngossiped and gesticulated. Pointing to them Nizamuddin said,\n“Look at those women—t h a t ’s how you should live in the world.”\n2  Practical Mysticism 195\nAsked to explain this cryptic remark, the Master continued, “These\nwomen re t u rning from the well with pitchers balanced on their\nheads seem to be thinking of nothing else but exchanging tid-bits\nof gossip with each other; and yet they are all the time concentrating\non something far more important, on balancing the pitchers on\ntheir heads. Thus, whatever your body , your senses or the pure l y\nsurface part of your mind may be occupied with, see that the root\nof your mind is constantly focussed on God.”\nVaitag and V airagya\nIf we look upon renunciation as being a state of mind, we can\nunderstand how this state of mind may be either temporary or per-\nmanent. The former is known as vaitag and the latter as vairagya.\nVaitag(temporary renunciation) is simply a temporary disgust\nfor the world and its affairs resulting from some shock, disap-\npointment or loss, combined with a vague desire for God; or it may\ncome from a sudden impulse. In vaitag the mind turns away from\nthe world and takes to godly ways; but this attitude is not lasting,\nand the mind re t u rns to its old ways as soon as circumstances alter,\nor as soon as the impulse dies down. \nVa i r a g y a( i rrevocable renunciation) however is an attitude of\nmind involving such a longing for God and such a deep indif f e r-\nence to things worldly that, once roused, it knows no re t reat and is\nproof against all temptations to give it up. The famous example of\nGautama Buddha is illustrative of vairagya.\nWe have already explained that renunciation is the overt expre s-\nsion of a latent desire for union with God combined with a latent\ns p irit of disgust for the world, and we used an analogy of flower,\npollen and fruit. As far as fertilization is concerned the ﬂower and\nthe pollen by themselves are helpless, for the two can only be\nb rought together by some outside agency , such as the wind, the bee\nor the insect. Whether or not fertilization takes place in nature may\ndepend upon so many thousands of unknown factors that mod-\nern science gives up trying to predict it, and labels it chance. That,\nh o w e v e r, is beside the point at the moment, and in our analogy we\nshall think of this fertilization as a gift.\n196 God Speaks Supplement\nTo re t u rn to v a i r a g y a ,let us remember that the longing for\nunion with God is latent in e v e ry living being. However, it only\npushes its way into consciousness when the soul approaches the\nbeginning of what Meher Baba, in the “Divine Theme,” calls “the re-\nalization p rocess.” The disgust for the world is also something that\ndevelops naturally in all of us and which grows more and more\np o w e rful as we draw nearer to the beginning of this r e a l i z a t i o n\np rocess. When the ﬂower is in full bloom and the pollen ripe, the\nwind or the bee gives the gift of fertilization that produces the fru i t .\nIn the same way also, when this moment of inner readiness comes,\na divine gift descends upon the soul which fertilizes the longing for\nGod and the disgust or indif f e rence for the world, and so brings\nabout the priceless fruit of v a i r a g y a. This divine gift may be a touch\nof inner grace from the indwelling God, or it may be the result of\ncontact with a saint or a Perfect Master. But it is always a gift.\nVairagya,when it ﬁrst becomes manifest, will almost certainly\ne x p ress itself for a time as an external renunciation. But v a i r a g y a ,\nbeing permanent, will always lead sooner or later to the real re-\nn u nciation which is intern a l .\nWhen an aspirant has such an intense longing for Truth he is\nqualified to enter the Path. There is a story of a Master who was\np e s t e red by a disciple as to when he would realize God. Once when\nthey went to bathe in a river the Master held the aspirant under\nwater for a few moments. When the disciple was on the verge of\ns u ffocation the Master pulled him out and asked what he had\nthought of and longed for most while under the water. The aspirant\nreplied, “Air.” The Master explained that when the disciple had just\nas intense a longing for God then Realization would come. Maulana\nRumi says:\nAb kamju, tishnigi avar bidast.\n“Call out for water less, but create thirst for it more.”\nIn the words of Meher Baba, “The Path begins with a conscious\nlonging for a deeper reality. As the ﬁsh which is taken out of water\nlongs to go back to the water, so the aspirant who has sensed the\nGoal longs to be united with God.\n2  Practical Mysticism 197\n“In fact, the longing to go back to the Source is present in each\nbeing from the very time that it gets separated from the Source by\nthe veil of ignorance, but it is unconscious till the aspirant enters\nthe Path.”*\nThe Suﬁs call this attitude of mind “ t a u b a ”meaning re p e n t a n c e\nand implying the turning away from or renouncing of the life of the\nsenses for the life of the spirit. One who has taken this great step\ndoes not look back again at that which he has left behind."

Only those on the\nfifth and sixth planes can bring others up to their own level and\nanyone upon whom their grace descends will be greatly beneﬁt e d .\nThe individual souls of the world are within the limits of the\ng ro s ss p h e re which includes all the gross suns, moons, worlds and\nall space. A savage, ignorant of the most elementary scientiﬁc laws\nand of the code of right and wrong, and a great philosopher or sci-\nentist are both within the bounds of the gross sphere. The philoso-\np h e rmay be quite familiar in theory with the subtle sphere; and the\nscientist may be an authority on the extreme frontiers of modern\nphysics; but, from the standpoint of the subtle, they and the savage\nbelong to the gross sphere. Until the subtle sphere is experienced,\ngnosis remains a subject for intellectual quibbling for all those be-\nlonging to the gross sphere because by “subtle” we do not mean\nm e rely the ﬁnest form of the gross. In the ord i n a ry sense of the word\nit may be correct to call very ﬁne substances such as ether, the atom,\nvibration, light and space, “subtle”; but they are unquestionably\ng ross, though in a very ﬁne form .\n198 God Speaks Supplement\n* [See also Meher Baba, “The Stages of the Path,” Discourses, 128–134. Ed.]\n2  Practical Mysticism 199\nSpiritually speaking, subtle means something completely dif-\nf e rent from the physical, however attenuated physical things may\nbe. Although the gross sphere is the outcome of the subtle sphere\nand is dependent on it, the subtle sphere is completely independent\nof the gross sphere. As an example, we may take the act of eating.\nThe gross act is the outcome of the thought, and depends upon it;\nbut the thought is independent of the physical act.\nForgetfulness\nThe whole philosophy of approaching and realizing the Tru t h\nhinges on the question of what we may call forgetfulness. The word\n“ f o rgetfulness” used here must not be associated with its commonly\naccepted meaning of forgetting to post a letter, or of a state of mind\nthat is simply dull and blank. Forgetfulness in this special sense is\nan attitude of mind that develops gradually into spiritual experi-\nence. External renunciation is not forgetfulness, because it is mostly\nphysical and partly mental; but internal renunciation, when it be-\ncomes purely mental, does assume the quality and dignity of for-\ngetfulness. Thus one may renounce the world, but it is not so easy\nto forget it.\nF o rgetfulness in this special sense thus explains the secr e t\nthat lies behind all happiness, spiritual or otherwise, that human\nbeings experience. The Suﬁ t e rm for this forgetfulness is b i k h u d i ,\nand it should not be mixed up—though it often is—with b i h o s h i\n( u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s ) .\nThe diff e rence between forgetfulness and unconsciousness is\ni m p o rtant, and a few examples of types of unconsciousness will help\nto make it clear. To begin with, one must remember that forgetful-\nness is the partial or total detachment of the mind from the phys i c a l\nworld, and unconsciousness the partial or total deadening of t h e\nmind to the physical world. The former gives rise to various degre e s\nof spiritual ecstasy and the latter to various degrees of cessation of\npleasure and pain.\nLet us then look at one or two examples of unconsciousness. In\np e rfect health one does not bother about the functioning of a vital\no rgan like the heart. This means that one forgets that this or g a n\n200 God Speaks Supplement\nis beating ceaselessly and perfectly in the human body for the\nmaintenance of life and health. If, however, there is a disturbance\nin the cardiac rhythm there is immediate discomfort, and if there is\na cardiac infarct there is immediate pre c o rdial pain. In either case\none is reminded that one has a heart. The sensation of discomfort\nor pain, though it arises from the heart, is felt only because of the\nfunctioning of the mind. The more the mind is directed to the\nh e a rt, the more the discomfort or pain is felt. When pain r e a c h e s\nits climax, unconsciousness may supervene—a break in the thre a d s\nof consciousness that enables one to forget the pain. But this is un-\nconsciousness and not forgetfulness in its spiritual sense. A surg e o n\nby perf o rming a pre f rontal leucotomy can interf e re with some of the\nn e rvous pathways that serve this focussing of the mind on the in-\ntractable pain of some incurable disease like cancer. After this o p-\neration the pain is still there, but the patient ceases to direct his mind\nt o w a rds it, and so ceases to bother about it. This again is a part i a l\nunconsciousness brought about by purely physical means, and not\nt rue forgetfulness in its spiritual sense. Sleep is a state of uncon-\nsciousness that aff o rds a temporary respite from the wear and tear\nof life; but sleep is not true forgetfulness in its spiritual sense.\nThe whole philosophy of happiness and unhappiness there f o re\nhinges on the question of forgetfulness of some kind or another,\nand of remembrance of some kind or another. Remembrance is an\nattachment of the mind to a particular idea, person, thing or place,\nand forgetfulness is its opposite. Once it is understood that re m e m-\nbrance causes pain, it follows that the only cure is some kind of for-\ngetfulness, and this forgetfulness may be either positive or nega-\ntive. The positive forgetfulness is one in which the mind r e m a i n s\na w a re of external stimuli, but refuses to react to them. The nega-\ntive forgetfulness is either mere unconsciousness—a stopping of\nthe mind as in sound sleep—or an acceleration of it as in madness,\nwhich has been defined as a way of avoiding the memory of suf-\nfering. Either sleep or madness may be artiﬁcially induced in vari-\nous degrees by the use of intoxicants or drugs; but this also is a\nnegative way of overcoming remembrance.\nPositive forgetfulness, then, is the cure, and its steady culti-\nvation develops in man that balance of mind which enables him to\n2  Practical Mysticism 201\ne x p ress such noble traits as charity , forgiveness, tolerance, self-\nlessness and service to others. One who is not equipped with this\npositive forgetfulness becomes a barometer of his surr o u n d i n g s .\nHis poise is disturbed by the slightest whisper of praise or ﬂattery ,\nand by the faintest suggestion of slander or criticism; his mind is\nlike a slender reed swayed by the lightest breeze of emotion. Such\na man is perpetually at war with himself and knows no peace.\nIn the exercise of this positive forgetfulness, not only is non-\nreaction to adverse circumstances essential, but also non-re a c t i o n\nto favourable and pleasurable circumstances. Of these two the lat-\nter is the harder and is less often described, although it matters just\nas much.\nPositive forgetfulness, although it lies at the very root of hap-\npiness, is by no means easy to acquire. Once a man attains this state\nof mind, however, he rises above pain and pleasure; he is master\nof himself. This forgetfulness, to be fully effective for the spiritual\nlife, must become permanent, and such permanence is only ac-\nq u i red through constant practice during many lives. Some people,\nas a result of eff o rts towards forgetfulness in past lives, get spon-\ntaneous and temporary flashes of it in a later life, and it is such\npeople who give to the world the best in poetry , art and philos-\nophy , and who make the greatest discoveries in science.\nIn such moments of true forgetfulness there is a mental de-\ntachment from all material surroundings in which the poet allows\nhis imagination to soar. An artist, when he gives form to an ideal in\nwhich he completely forgets himself and all irrelevant surr o u n d-\nings, creates a masterpiece. The best of philosophy is uttered when\na man surveys the problem of life without reference to the ups and\ndowns of his purely personal circumstances; and some of the gre a t-\nest scientific discoveries have been made in this same frame of\nmind. Such manifestations of genuine spontaneity of forg e t f u l n e s s\na re very rare indeed, and although it is said that poets, artists and\nphilosophers are born and not made, these ﬂeeting phases of r e a l\nforgetfulness are the result of efforts made in past lives.\nIn an attempt to make life bearable some people develop a feeble\nkind of stoicism—a sort of “who cares, anyway” outlook—and oth-\ners plunge recklessly into epicurism. The former is the apathetic\nacceptance of defeat, and the latter the eff o rt to forget defeat in the\na rms of pleasure. Neither is true forgetfulness. But when a man\na cq u i res the true forgetfulness, he enters the spiritual kingdom a n d\npasses through diff e rent degrees of forgetfulness until the Goal is\nreached. Meher Baba tells us, “Forgetfulness of the world makes\none a pilgrim ( r a h r a v, sadhak); f o rgetfulness of the next world\nmakes one a saint; forgetfulness of self means Realization; and for-\ngetfulness of forgetfulness is Perfection.”\n3"

It is very difﬁcult to\npass out of this state of enchantment if the pilgrim once stops\nt h e re, although most pilgrims pass directly from the third to the\nf o u rth plane. Unless the pilgrim gets out of this state quickly and\np roceeds onwards to the fourth plane, his pro g ress will be held up\n204 God Speaks Supplement\ni nd e f i n i t e l y. Once a pilgrim becomes thus enchanted he r e m a i n s\nso for days, months or years together. He can neither make furt h e r\np rog ress nor can he re t ro g ress. He is neither gro s s-conscious nor\ns u b t l e -conscious. Neither can he be calledunconscious because he\nis fully conscious of the enchantment, and it is because of this con-\nsciousness of the enchantment that he lives this living death.\nThe physical condition of the deeply enchanted pilgrim is no\nless strange, for if he seats himself in a particular position, he re-\nmains in that position for months or years together. Similarly , if he\nbecomes enchanted while standing, he will continue standing until\nthe enchantment ends. In short, he remains stationary in the po-\nsition in which he ﬁrst becomes enchanted, and, although he may\nappear to be a lifeless statue, he is in fact more alive than the or-\ndinary man of the world.\nIt is well known to the Suﬁ world how Ali Ahmed Sabir of Piran\nK a l y a r, who after w a rds became a Perfect Master, once r e m a i n e d\nstanding for years near a certain tree. During this period Sabir’s\nmind was absorbed in the enchantment of thism u q a m-e - h a i r a ta n d\nhe was delivered from it by a Q u t u b. Only natural death or divine\nhelp from a living Master can help such a dazed pilgrim out of his\nspiritual stalemate. A Master would help such a pilgrim either by\nbringing him back to the third plane or by pushing him onwards.\nH a ﬁz no doubt thinks of this stage of the pilgrim when he says:\nMastam kun an cunan kih nadanam zi biKvudi\nDar ’arsih Kiyal kih amad kudam raft.\n“Make me so dazed and intoxicated that, on account of this\nstate of forgetfulness, I should be oblivious of what came\ninto my mind and of what passed out of it.”\nMeher Baba explains that a pilgrim runs the risk of entering\nm u q a m - e - h a i r a t(state of enchantment) when he passes from the\nt h i rd to the fourth plane. There are, he says, states of enchantment\non other parts of the Path also, but the most important is that be-\ntween the third and the fourth planes. This h a i r a t( e n c h a n t m e n t )\nmay be strong or feeble. If there is no hitch or disturbing factor pre s-\nent at the moment that a pilgrim becomes enchanted, then the\nh a i r a tis deep, or strong. If there is a disturbing factor present at\nthat moment then the h a i r a tis feeble. If a pilgrim experiences either\ns t rong or feeble h a i r a tbetween the third and fourth planes and is\nthen pushed forw a rd by accident to a higher plane, he invariably\ngoes to a position between the ﬁfth and sixth planes, again with the\nsame strong or feeble h a i r a t. However, such instances are very rare .\nAli Ahmed Sabir of Kalyar and Baba Abdur Rahman of Bombay\nboth were precipitated from a very strong hairat between the third\nand fourth planes into a very strong h a i r a tbetween the fifth and\nsixth planes, the former by a gift of grace from a Q u t u band the\nlatter through God’s gift in the shape of an accident.\nA complete ﬁxity of posture that lasts until death, or until a Per-\nfect Master is contacted, is seen only in those pilgrims who have\na v e ry strong h a i r a t. A mast ( G o d-intoxicated) who has been with\nMeher Baba for many years was in this m u q a m - e - h a i r a tbetween the\nt h i rd and fourth planes when he was brought to Meher Baba in\nRahuri in 1 9 3 6; but his h a i r a twas feeble, and although he would\nstand for many hours at a stretch in one position, this position would\nnot be maintained per m a n e n t l y. The enchantment of Ali Ahmed\nS a b i r, however, was a strong one, and he remained in one posture\nuntil he was ﬁnally delivered from the enchantment by a Q u t u b.\nThis state of enchantment should on no account be confused\nwith the catatonic stupor of a schizophrenic, although it may appear\ns i m i l a r. Both are states of enchantment, but they are poles apart. \n7"

It then exists as God’s shadow , which means that\nGod is both in the stage of Knowledge and ignorance. The follow-\ning four angles of the one experience, written in the language of\nS u ﬁgnosis, are diff e rent aspects of gnosis of souls in the sixth plane\nwhen they are face to face with God, but still in the domain of du-\na l i t y. All of these aspects are experienced together at the same time.\n1. Hama ust This means ‘Everything is He’; and for one\nwho experiences this gnosis, only God exists.\n2.

    "topic": "Different Types of Miracles",
    "text": "Different Types of Miracles (67)\nMeher Baba has given us an explanation of the dif f e rence be-\ntween the miracles of:\n1. A Saviour (Avatar)\n2. A Perfect Master (Sadguru)\n3. A pir and a wali (i.e., one on the 6th or 5th plane, \nrespectively)\n4. Those on the lower planes ( i.e., 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th)\nIn connection with these four types Meher Baba tells us:\n1. The miracles of a Saviour a re of a universal character and are\np e rf o rmed when universally necessary . When a Saviour intends\nworking a miracle, he stations himself for the time being on the\n6th, 5th or 4th plane, as demanded by circumstances. When,\nhowever, it is desired that the miracles be very forceful, he sta-\ntions himself for the time being on the 4th plane.\n2. The miracles of a Perfect Master are on a very large scale, but\nthey do not cover the whole universe. Like the Saviour’s mir-\nacles, however, they are wrought solely for the spiritual awak-\nening of others. Like the Saviour also, the Perfect Master who\nintends working a miracle stations himself on the 6th, 5th or\n4th plane for the time being; and for a very forceful miracle, he\nstations himself for the time being on the 4th plane. No mir-\nacles are ever wrought by the M a j z o o b - e-K a m i lof the 7th plane\nfor the simple reason that the three spheres, the mental, subtle\nand gross, do not exist for such a soul.\n3. The miracles of a pir or w a l ia re on a limited scale. In fact they\np e rf o rm no miracles dire c t l y. However, such miracles as can be\nattributed to them are wrought from their mental inﬂuence over\nthe thoughts and feelings of others, yielding both spiritual and\nmaterial beneﬁts. They do not come down to the 4th plane—t h e\nplane of almighty spiritual powers.\n4. Pilgrims of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd planes can use or demon-\nstrate powers from their own plane, such as reading the minds\nof others, p roducing things from nowhere, reciting words or pas-\nsages from a book without seeing it, stopping trains, allowing\nthemselves to be buried alive for hours together, levitation, etc.,\netc. These are actual powers acquired by the pilgrim on the dif-\nf e rent planes and, as such, cannot be called mere jugglery . Per-\nfect Masters and the Avatar can snatch away a pilgrim’s ability\nto use the powers from the lower planes, viz., 1st, 2nd and 3rd ,\nand can even snatch away the almighty powers of one on the 4t h\nplane. Such a snatching away of powers of those on the lower\nplanes is known to the Suﬁs as s a l b-e-w i l a y a t .\nOn the fourth plane are stored all the almighty powers* w h i c h ,\nif misused by the pilgrim, result in his utter ruin. But such miracles\ndo not affect the world adversely, because the Qutub-e-Irshad—the\n11  Different T ypes of Miracles 209\n* One on the fourth plane is known as a mahayogi (a great yogi).\nhead of the spiritual hierarchy of the age—takes care to make these\nactions ineffective.\nMeher Baba further explains that the indiscriminate display of\npowers by a pilgrim of the ﬁrst three planes is fraught with serious\ndangers, but that one who misuses the powers of the fourth plane in-\nvariably falls back to the lowest phase of evolution—the stone state.\nKabir has referred to these dangers when he says:\nSaheba ka ghara dura hai jaisi lambi khajura\nCarhe so cakhe prema-rasa gire cakanacur .\n“The Lord ’s house is high, like the top of the tallest date palm.\nIf he climbs it, he tastes the nectar of love; if he falls, he\nbreaks his neck.”\nConscious and Unconscious Occurrence of Miracles\nThe miracles wrought by Saviours and Perfect Masters have a di-\nvine motive behind them and may be either voluntary or involun-\nt a ry . The voluntary miracles of a Saviour or Perfect Master are those\nthat he deliberately perf o rms by the expression and force of his w i l l ,\nand the involuntary ones are those that occur independently of the\nwill of the Saviour or Perfect Master and are wrought by means of\nthe ever-active force that surrounds these great beings. In the latter\ntype of miracle the Saviour or Perfect Master is unaware of the in-\ncidents of the miracle of which he himself is the source and prime\ncause. Both voluntary and involuntary miracles of these Per f e c t\nOnes are nevertheless always directed towards the spiritual awak-\nening of the world.\nWhy Do Saviours and Perfect Masters Perform Miracles?\nVe ry worldly people are spiritually obtuse, and they sometimes\nneed miracles to save themselves or other quite innocent people\nfrom the results of this insensitivity. The following analogy shows\nwhat is meant thereby .\nLet us suppose that a child is holding a sparrow in his hand and\nin so careless a way that he is on the point of strangling it. In order\nto save the sparro w ’s life it would be inadvisable to try to snatch the\n210 God Speaks Supplement\n11  Different T ypes of Miracles 211\nb i rd from the child’s hand, for the child would probably tighten\nhis grip on the sparrow and so kill it. But if the child is o ff e re d\na coin, he will almost certainly relax his hold on the sparrow and\nso release it. The child is thus prevented from killing the bird out\nof sheer ignorance of what he is doing. The miracles of a Per f e c t\nMaster accomplish the same sort of thing; they prevent people\nf rom doing themselves and others harm out of sheer ignorance\nof spiritual values. \nIf gold is deﬁned to r e p resent miracles, a yogi of the lower\nplanes dazzles worldly people by dangling this gold in front of\ntheir eyes so that they are astounded by his prowess. Should they\ns u rrender themselves to such a yogi they will ultimately suffer a\nc ruel disillusionment. But when the Saviour or a Perfect Master\ndangles this gold in front of the eyes of worldly people, he uses one\nf o rm of M a y ato drag them away from other and more binding\nf o rms of M a y a ,and so draws them towards the Path that leads to\ntheir true destiny , Self-realization.\nLet us take another illustration and imagine a man withm o n o-\nc h romatic vision to whom the world appears blue for example. His\neyes thus act like blue spectacles so that when he looks thr o u g h\nthem everything seems to be blue. Spiritually speaking the world\nis illusion and so has no colour at all. It is colourless. A yogi demon-\nstrating his miraculous powers merely replaces this man’s blue\n“spectacles” by green or red ones so that he sees everything as gre e n\nor red. To his ignorant eyes, accustomed to seeing the world blue,\nthis sudden change to green or red is astounding, and re ﬂects gre a t\na p p a rent credit on the yogi.\nA Perfect Master, knowing that neither blue nor red nor gre e n\nis the true colour, but that everything is colourless (i . e . ,n o t h i n g ) ,\nwastes no time in changing “spectacles,” thereby enabling the man\nto see the world as it really is: colourless, or nothing. The yogi and\nthose lesser masters who are not perfect merely replace one illusion\nby another. But a Perfect Master permanently tears away the veil of\na l lillusion and reveals the truth that Creation is imaginary and that\nGod alone is real. This working of the Perfect Master is a slow and\npainful process that lacks the colourfulness of the yogi’s spectacul a r\nand misleading method, and it is for this reason that the working\nof the Perfect Masters is unfathomable.\nWho Owns the Powers by Which Miracles Are Wrought?\nThe miraculous powers of a Perfect Master appear the same\nas those of a yogi of the fourth plane, but there is this important dif-\nf e rence, that the powers of a Perfect Master are his own, because he\nis Power itself. He has simply to will a thing and it is done. “Be and\nit was” (Kun faya kun )refers, according to the Suﬁs, to the divine\nmanifestation of power.\nThe yogis’ powers, however, are not their own and they have\nto depend on extraneous sources of power for working miracles.\nThe inherent powers of Perfect Masters are continually overﬂo w i n g ,\nand yogis and pilgrims of the lower planes borrow these overﬂo w-\ning powers and work miracles with them.This is quite in conso-\nnance with the Suﬁ belief that walis are the Prophet Muhammad’s\nwitnesses, and that all their miracles, like drops oozing from a skin\nﬁlled with honey , are derived from him. Endorsed by orthodox Mus-\nlims, this belief is limited in scope however, because it is applied\nonly to the personality of the Prophet Muhammad. Its universal ap-\nplicability is at once suggested though by the Suﬁ belief that fro m\nthe beginning there has been only o n eR a s o o lwho appears fro m\ntime to time in diff e rent countries under diff e rent names.\nIlluminating this point still furt h e r, Meher Baba has explained,\n“In f a n a-ﬁl l a h(the M a j z o o bstate) there are no miracles, direct or\ni n d i rect. In Divine Junction (turiya avasthaor m u q a m-e-f u ru t a t )t h e\nJ i v a n m u k t a ( A z a d-e-M u t l a q )has no duty and perf o rms no miracles.\nBut there is always a possibility of miracles happening through the\nJ i v a n m u k t awithout his being aware of it. The agents or pilgrims of\nthe lower planes very often borrow his powers and work miracles\nwith them, but the powers of the J i v a n m u k t aa re not in any way\nlessened thereby .”\nMiracles of the Saviour (Rasool or Avatar) \nand Perfect Masters (Sadgurus)\nWhen God becomes man, He becomes a Saviour ( R a s o o lo r\nAvatar) and when man becomes God, he becomes a Majzoob, and,\n212 God Speaks Supplement\n11  Different T ypes of Miracles 213\nif he has duty to perform to humanity, he traverses the second and\nt h i rd divine journeys and becomes a Perfect Master ( S a d g u ru ) .B o t h\nthe Saviour and the Perfect Master are spiritually perfect, because\nboth are one with God, and although both have a duty towards hu-\nmanity , that of the Saviour is of a special kind.\nThe Suﬁs say that the “relationship” ( q u r b a t )with God differs in\nthe Saviour and the Perfect Master, and they refer to them as q u r b -\ne - f a r a y i z( i n v o l u n t a ry necessary nearness) and q u r b-e-n a w a f i l\n( v o lu n t a ry nearness) re s p e c t i v e l y. Q u r b-e-f a r a y i zthus belongs to the\nSaviours and q u r b-e-n a w a ﬁl to the Perfect Masters.\nThe Suﬁs explain that in the working of miracles by the R a s o o l\n(the Av a t a r), God is the actor and man the instrument; while in a\nP e rfect Master it is the other way round—man is the actor and God\nthe instrument. The famous incident of the Prophet Muhammad\nt h rowing a handful of dust at the enemy in the battle of Badr and\nt h e reby routing them is an example of a Saviour working a mira c l e .\nAlthough to all appearances it was Muhammad as a man who\nthrew the dust, in reality it was God as Muhammad who threw the\ndust, and Muhammad as a man who routed the enemy . A miracle\nsuch as this is therefore an illustration of qurb-e-farayiz.\nThe miracles perf o rmed by Perfect Masters are, however, illus-\ntrations of q u r b-e-n a w a ﬁl ,of which the miracle of Shamsi Ta b r i z —\nthat of raising the dead to life—is a good example. When Shams\nu t t e red the words “Qum bi ixn i l l a h ”(arise in the name of God) the\nprince did not come to life; but when he said“Qum bi ixni” (arise in\nmy name) the prince at once came to life. Here Shamsi Tabriz as\nman gave the ord e r, and God as Shamsi Tabriz clothed himself with\nthe attribute of Himself—in this case with the attribute of life—and\nso re s t o red the prince to life. In q u r b-e-n a w a ﬁl man is the actor and\nGod the instru m e n t .\nLet us for a moment discuss the diff e rence in the attitude of East\nand West towards miracles. The East, which possesses a long re c o rd\nof familiarity with Perfect Masters and advanced souls, has come to\naccept that God, because He is inﬁnite, cannot be comprehended by\nthe ﬁnite mind. The East knows that human intellect, which is lim-\nited in scope, has its use only up to a certain stage in tackling meta-\nphysical problems. As sung by the philosopher Dr. Iqbal:\n’Aql go astaj se dur nahij\nUski taqdir maij huyur nahij\n“Intellect, though not far away from the threshold (of the\nBeloved) is not destined to enjoy the Divine Presence.”\nThe East thus knows that at the point where intellect gives up\nits eff o rts in grappling with that which is transcendental, love must\ntake up the link. The West sets great store by the intellectual ap-\np roach, and that which refuses to come within the orbit of intellect\nis apt to be either denied or scoffed at. As a by-p roduct of this oc-\ncidental attitude we may cite the utter misuse of the word “mystic”\nin current American idiom. The ardent religious enthusiasm of\nmedieval Europe has been almost replaced by great enthusiasm for\nculture and science.\nThe doctrines of science are, however, ﬂuid to a certain extent,\nand the genuine scientist does look facts in the face, but Meher Baba\nhas often declared that in spite of its great pro g ress science is yet far\nf rom the core of material things, and further from the outer m o s t\nfringe of spiritual things. The heart must cooperate with the head.\nIt may be that some of the purely physical feats of yogis, which\npass for miracles with the multitude, can be explained away by\nmedical science. But real miracles, particularly the miracles of\nP e rfect Masters, do not admit of scientiﬁc explanation. Many of the\nmiracles wrought by Saviours, Perfect Masters and saints are re-\nc o rded in the spiritual legends and classics of all peoples and all re l i-\ngions, and the ever-functioning spiritual hierarchy is daily adding\nto these miracles. The facts are there; Jesus and other Perfect O n e s\nhave raised the dead to life, and have healed diseases. But even if\none were to see a miracle take place before one’s very eyes, and even\nif one were convinced that it was a miracle and not trickery , one\nwould never be able to formulate a rational explanation of it, for\nmiracles are utterly beyond the reach of intellectual explanation.\nThey are a mystery as deep as life itself.\nP e rhaps, however, the fault is not entirely without reason, for\nthe world at large seldom gets an insight into the workings of Per-\nfect Masters, and, in truth, most of these workings lie tr e a s u re d\nin the breasts of a few intimate associates and deserving initiates,\n214 God Speaks Supplement\n12"

In the words of the famous\nSuﬁ Abdul Hasan Kharqani, “If a few drops of that which is under\nthe skin of a Perfect Master should come forth between his lips, all\nthe creatures of heaven and earth would fall into panic.”\nIn spite of the mass appeal of miracles and of the claims of spiri-\ntual masters, the East, like the West, is also very circumspect in its\nattitude towards them. It may be said to its credit, however, that the\nEast has learned by long experience not to deny the actions of the\nspiritual hierarc h y, even if it cannot see its way to accept or believe\nin them. One of the earliest Suﬁs has declared, “Miracles are only\none of the thousand stages on the way to God”; and the Av a t a ro f\nthis cycle, Meher Baba, afﬁrms that the greatest miracle a Per f e c t\nMaster can perf o rm is to make another man spiritually perfect like\nhimself.\n12 Kinds of Powers (67)\nSpirituality and spiritualism are two diff e rent things. Spiritual-\nity has nothing to do with any kind of power in any form. Spiri-\ntuality is the path of love for God and obedience and surrender to\nthe Perfect Master.\nAs one travels the Path, one comes across powers on the planes\nof consciousness. Those on the planes from ﬁrst to fourth are some-\ntimes tempted to demonstrate these powers.\nThere are three kinds of powers:\n1. The divine powers of the fourth plane.\n2. The occult powers of the ﬁrst three planes of \nconsciousness. These are called the mystic powers.\n3. Other occult powers. \n1. The divine powersof the fourth plane are the almighty powe r s\nof God. They are the source of all powers, whether mystic or\nother occult powers.\nThe mystic and other occult powers are inﬁnitely insigniﬁ-\ncant in comparison with the divine powers.\nThe divine powers remain always the same because God is\nalways One and the same. The occult powers, whether they are\nof the planes or not, are diff e rent in kind and vary in expre s s i o n .\nThe miracles perf o rmed through the manifestation of the\ndivine powers by the Avatar and the Qutub a re called m o j e z a t .\nThese are per f o rmed for the good of all—on a limited scale\nby the Qutub and on a universal scale by the Av a t a r. H o w e v e r,\nthese can be performed for any individual in close association\nwith the Avatar or the Qutub.\nThe miracles per f o rmed indirectly by those on the fifth\nand sixth planes with the help of the divine powers are called\nk a r a m a a t .\nThe display of the mystic powers by those on the ﬁrst up\nt h rough the third plane cannot in fact be termed miracles. Such\na display is nothing but a show of powers that they come acro s s\nwhile traversing the planes; such a display of powers is called\nshobada.\nWhen the one on the fourth plane makes good use of the\ndivine powers and per f o rms a miracle, it can be termed as\nkaramat-e-mojeza; when he makes a bad use of them, i.e., mis-\nuses the divine powers of the fourth plane, it is termed m o j e z a -\ne-shobada.\nThe fourth plane is re g a rded as the “threshold” of the men-\ntal sphere, and so the misuse of the divine powers on the fourt h\nplane results in a “fall” as far back as the stone state and re s u l t s\nin disintegration of consciousness.\n2 . The occult powers of the ﬁrst three planes, called the mystic\npowers, cannot be misused by the aspirant on these planes,\nthough they sometimes are tempted to display them. These mys-\ntic powers are diff e rent and vary in expression, such as: re a d-\ning the minds of others; reciting words or passages from a book\nwithout seeing it; allowing themselves to be buried alive for\nhours together, etc.\nThe powers of the planes are not induced. These powers\na re ever accessible to those on the planes, within their own\nl i mited environment, and as such need no concentrated effort\nto display them. This display of powers should not be confused\nwith the demonstrations of mind readers and of others who put\non stage performances.\n216 God Speaks Supplement\n12  Kinds of Powers 217\nThe one on the third plane of consciousness can raise dead\nsub-human creatures but can never make a dead human being\nalive. This he can do because of the nearness to and “warmth”\nof the divine powers of the fourth plane.\nBut one on the fourth plane can raise the dead including\nhuman beings by the use of the divine powers of the four t h\nplane.\nThe one on the third plane can change his physical form\nat will, and one who does this is known as abdal. This act is\nalso a display of the mystic powers, but not the misuse of pow-\ners. However, this act should not be confused with the dema-\nterialization or materialization of the human forms by the\ntantriks.\n3. Other occult powers have nothing to do with spirituality or\nwith the mystic powers of the planes.\nThese occult powers are of two types:\na. Superior occult powers.\nb. Inferior occult powers.\nThe one who has these occult powers can make good or bad\nuse of the same. Good use of occult powers helps one to put\nhimself on the planes of the Path and may even make one a m a-\nhayogi. Bad use of these occult powers makes one suffer in-\ntensely in the next human form. Good use of superior occult\npowers puts one on the ﬁfth plane of consciousness after four\nlives (reincarnations).\na . Superior types of occult powers are derived from t a n t r i k\ne x e rcises such as c h i l l a-nashini or repetition of cer t a i n\nmantras, e t c .\nThe one who holds these powers can per f o rm the so-\ncalled miracles such as levitation, ﬂying and ﬂoating in the\nair, dematerialization and materialization, etc.\nb. Inferior types of occult powers need no tantrik or any spe-\ncial exercises. They are had through sanskaras of past lives.\nFor example: if someone has done certain good deeds many\ntimes in the past, his next incarnation may give him the\n218 God Speaks Supplement\nf a culty of inferior occult powers without undergoing any\ns t renuous exercises. His sanskaras give him the faculty\nof inferior occult powers such as clairvoyance, clairaudi-\nence, healing, producing sweets or money seemingly out\nof nothing, etc.\nAll such capabilities form part of the lower or inferior\ntype of occult powers.\nIf one makes good use of the inferior type of occult pow-\ners, he derives superior type of occult powers in his next life\nwithout undergoing any tantrik e x e rcises. Likewise, the one\nwho puts to good use his faculty of hypnotism gains the su-\nperior type of occult powers in his next life.\n13"

To gain full consciousness, it\ngets increasing s a n s k a r a sin the process of evolution, till in the human\nf o rm, it gets full consciousness as well as all the gross s a n s k a r a s.\nIn the process of r e i n c a rnation, this soul retains its full con-\nsciousness and exchanges ( i . e., a l t e rnatingly experiences) the di-\nverse s a n s k a r a sin itself; and in the process of realization, this soul\nretains its full consciousness, but its s a n s k a r a sbecome fainter and\nfainter till they all disappear and only consciousness remains. While\nbecoming faint, gross s a n s k a r a sbecome subtle s a n s k a r a s ,s u b t l e\ns a n s k a r a sbecome mental s a n s k a r a s ;and ﬁnally they all disappear.\nUp to the human form, the winding process of s a n s k a r a sb e-\ncomes stronger and stronger in the process of evolution. In the hu-\nman form, in the process of re i n c a rnation, the winding retains its\nfull strength; but in the process of realization, the s a n s k a r a sg r a d u-\nally unwind themselves, till in the God-state, they are completely\nunwound.\nGod, the Over-Soul, alone is real. Nothing exists but God. The\nd i ff e rent souls are in the Over-Soul and one with it. The pro c e s s e s\nof evolution, re i n c a rnation and realization are all necessary in ord e r\nto enable the soul to gain self-consciousness. In the process of wind-\ning, s a n s k a r a sbecome instrumental for the evolution of conscious-\nness though they also give sanskaric bindings; and in the pro c e s s\nof unwinding, sanskaric attachments are annihilated, though the\nconsciousness which has been gained is fully re t a i n e d .\nIn the process of the winding of s a n s k a r a s ,the soul goes thro u g h\nseven stages of descent; and in the process of unwinding, the soul\ngoes through seven stages of ascent. But the phenomena of descent\nas well as ascent are both illusory . The soul is every w h e re and indi-\nvisibly inﬁnite; and it does not move or descend or ascend.\n* See chart IX. “A” soul becomes “Z” soul. \nThe souls of all men and women, of all nationalities, castes and\nc reeds, are really one; and their experiences of good and evil, of\nﬁghting and helping, of waging wars and living in peace are all a\np a rt of illusion and delusion, because all these experiences are\ngained through bodies and minds, which in themselves are nothing.\nB e f o re the world of forms and duality came into existence,\nt h e re was nothing but God, i . e ., an indivisible and boundless ocean\nof Power, Knowledge and Bliss. But this ocean was unconscious\nof itself. Picture to yourself this ocean as absolutely still and calm,\nunconscious of its Power, Knowledge and Bliss and unconscious\nthat it is the ocean. The billions of drops which are in the ocean do\nnot have any consciousness; they do not know that they are drops\nnor that they are in the ocean nor that they are a part of the ocean.\nThis represents the original state of Reality .\nThis original state of Reality comes to be disturbed by an urge\nto know itself. This urge was always latent in the ocean; and when\nit begins to express itself, it endows the drops with individuality .\nWhen this urge makes the still water move, there immediately\nspring up numerous bubbles or forms around the drops; and it is\nthese bubbles which give individuality to the drops. The bubbles\ndo not and cannot actually divide the indivisible ocean; they can-\nnot separate the drop from the ocean; they merely give to these\ndrops a feeling of separateness or limited individuality .\nNow let us study the life of one dr o p-soul through its dif f e r-\nent stages. Owing to the arising of the bubble, the drop-soul which\nwas completely unconscious is invested with individuality (or a\nfeeling of separateness) as well as with very slight consciousness.\nThis consciousness, which has sprung up in the dro p-soul, is not\nof itself nor of the ocean; but it is of the bubble or the form, which\nin itself is nothing. This imperfect bubble at this stage is r e p re-\nsented by the f o rm of a stone. After some time, this bubble or form\nbursts and there springs up in its place another bubble or for m .\nNow, when a bubble bursts, two things happen: (1) there is an in-\nc rease in consciousness and (2) t h e re is a twist or consolidation\nof impressions or s a n s k a r a saccumulated during the life of the pre-\nvious bubble. The consciousness of the dro p-soul has now slightly\n14  The Divine Theme 221\ni n c reased; but the dr o p-soul is still conscious only of this new\nbubble or form and not of itself nor of the ocean. This new bubble\nis re p resented by the form of the metal. This new bubble or form\nalso bursts in due course of time; and simultaneously there is a\nf u rther increase in consciousness and a fresh twist or consolidation\nof s a n s k a r a s ,which gives rise to the emergence of another type of\nbubble or form.\nThis process continues right through the course of evolution,\nwhich covers the stages of stones, metals, vegetables, worms, ﬁs h e s ,\nb i rds and animals. Every time that the previous bubble or f o rm\nbursts, it gains more consciousness and adds one twist to the al-\nready accumulated s a n s k a r a s ,until it reaches the human bubble or\nf o rm, in which the ever-i n c reasing consciousness becomes full and\ncomplete. The process of the winding up of s a n s k a r a sconsists of\nthese regular twists; and it is these twists which keep the con-\nsciousness, gained by the dro p-soul, directed and ﬁxed towards the\nbubble or the form instead of towards its real Self, even when con-\nsciousness is fully developed in the human form.\nOn gaining the human form, the second process begins; this\np rocess is that of r e i n c a rnation. At this point, the process of the\nwinding up of s a n s k a r a scomes to an end. The dro p-soul takes nu-\nm e rous human forms one by one; and these forms are exactly\ne i g h t y-four l a k h sin number. These human forms are sometimes\nthose of man and sometimes those of woman; and they change na-\ntionalities, appearance, colour and creed. The dr o p-soul thro u g h\nhuman incarnations experiences itself sometimes as a beggar and\nsometimes as a king, and thus gathers experiences of the oppo-\nsites of happiness or misery according to its good or bad s a n-\ns k a r a s. In re i n c a rnation (i . e . ,in its successive and several human\nf o rms) the dro p-soul retains its full consciousness but continues\nto have alternating experiences of opposite s a n s k a r a s, till the\np rocess of realization begins. And during this process of r e a l i z a-\ntion the s a n s k a r a sget unwound. In r e i n c a rnations, there is a\nspending up of s a n s k a r a s ;but this spending up is quite dif f e re n t\nf rom the unwinding of the s a n s k a r a s ,which takes place during the\np rocess of realization. The spending up of s a n s k a r a sitself cre a t e s\n222 God Speaks Supplement\nnew s a ns k a r a s ,which bind the soul; but the unwinding of s a n s k a r a s\ndoes not itself create fresh s a n s k a r a s ;and it is intended to undo the\nv e ry strong grip of s a n s k a r a s ,in which the dro p-soul is caught.\nUp to the human form, the winding up of s a n s k a r a sb e c o m e s\ns t ronger and stronger during the process of evolution. In the human\nforms of reincarnation, the winding continues to operate as a lim-\niting factor; but with every change of the human bubble or for m ,\nthe tight twists, gained during the process of winding, get loosened\nt h rough eighty-four l a k h sof shakings,* b e f o re they are ready to un-\nwind in the process of realization.\nNow begins the third process of realization, which is aprocess\nof ascent. Here, the dro p-soul undergoes the gradual unwinding of\nthe s a n s k a r a s. During this process of unwinding, the s a n s k a r a sb e-\ncome fainter and fainter; and at the same time, the consciousness\nof the dro p-soul gets directed more and more towards itself; and\nthus, the dro p-soul passes through the subtle and mental planes till\nall the sanskaras disappear completely, enabling it to become con-\nscious of itself as the ocean.\nIn the inﬁnite ocean of the Over-Soul, you are the drop or the\nsoul. You are the soul in the ord i n a ry state; and you use your con-\nsciousness in seeing and experiencing the bubble or the for m .\nT h rough the gross layer of the bubble, you experience that part of\nthe huge gross bubble which is the earth. You are eternally lodged\nand indivisibly one with the Over-Soul; but you do not experience\nit. In the advanced stage, up through the third plane, you use your\nconsciousness in seeing and experiencing the huge subtle bubble\ncalled the subtle world, through the subtle bubble or form called\n14  The Divine Theme 223\n* [Many readers do not discern that Meher Baba customarily described the life cycle\nas: evolution, reincarnation, involution and the process of realization.\nFearing the statement in the text above might seem contradictory to that in para-\ngraph 3, page 176, we asked Eruch B. Jessawala for clariﬁcation.\nHe replied: “Once one is on the planes of consciousness, the reincarnation process\nmay be said to have come to its fag end. On the Path leading to Beloved God, the\nimpatience to ‘see’ Him and to be One with Him is intense. Such r e i n c a rn a t i o n s\nas are necessary, due to impressions burdening the consciousness, seem almost\nnil when compared to eighty-four lakhs of shakings.” Ed.]\n224 God Speaks Supplement\nthe subtle body; but you do not see and experience the Over-S o u l\nwhich you are in, since your consciousness is not now directed to-\nw a rds the Over-Soul. In the advanced stage from the f o u rt h\nt h rough the sixth plane, you use your consciousness in see i n g\nand experiencing the huge mental bubble, which is called the men-\ntal world, through the mental bubble or form which is called the\nmental body , but even now you do not experience the Over-S o u l .\nBut in the God-realized state, you continually use your conscious-\nness for seeing and experiencing the Over-Soul; and then all the\nforms are known as being nothing but bubbles.\nSo, now , picture yourself as the soul-d rop, lodged in the Over-\nSoul, behind ﬁve layers after the gross body . You, the soul-drop, are\nnow looking at the gross body and through it at the gross world.\nWhen you look at the second layer and through it, the first layer\nwill appear to you as nothing but a layer only , and thus, looking\nb ehind each layer, you will find all these layers as only your\nshadow covers; and ﬁn a l l y, when you (i . e . ,the soul-d rop) look at\nand get merged in the Over-Soul, you realize that only you were\nreal and all that you were seeing and experiencing till now was\nyour own shadow and nothing else.\nExplanation of Charts IX and X\nChart IX\nThe big semi-c i rcle in Chart IX re p resents the Over-Soul, which\ncontains everything in the universe. The life of a single individ-\nual soul is depicted in the three main stages of evolution, re i n c a r-\nnation and the process of realization. “S” stands for the individual\nsoul. Before attaining the human form, it goes through seven stages\nof each of the following kinds of existence, viz., stone, metal, vege-\ntable, worm, ﬁsh, bird and animal. At the seventh stage, i . e . ,just be-\nf o re entering a new kind of existence, you will note a pictorial\nre p resentation of a twist or a knot, which stands for a consolidation\nof previously acquired s a n s k a r a s. The outer red circle round the i n-\ndividual soul “S,” re p resents the s a n s k a r a saccumulated during the\nprocess of evolution; and the blue appendage to “S” represents the\n\n14  The Divine Theme 225\nconsciousness, which comes to be developed simultaneously . “ A ”\nsoul becomes “Z” soul after going through evolution, re i n c a rn a t i o n\nand the process of realization. It is only in the God state that con-\nsciousness is free from sanskaras.\nThe gross, subtle and mental worlds ( i . e . ,anna bhumi, pran\nbhumi and mano bhumi) are each represented by a big circle on the\nr i g h t-hand side. Since consciousness of the gross world is not fully\ndeveloped in the pre-human stages of evolution, the lines which\nconnect the stone, metal, vegetable, worm, fish, bird and animal\nsouls, through their respective stone, metal, vegetable, worm, ﬁs h ,\nb i rd and animal forms, are shown merely as touching the gr o s s\nworld only partially; while, since consciousness is fully developed\nin the human form, it is shown (through corresponding lines) as\nbeing capable of understanding the entire gross world in all its dif-\nferent aspects.\nIn the process of re i n c a rnations, the soul may take a male or a\nfemale form; and it may belong to any nationality , creed or re l i g i o n .\nF rom the point of view of self-knowledge, the process up to the at-\ntainment of the human forms re p resents an actual descent, though\nit looks like an ascent; and the process of realization r e p re s e n t s\nan actual ascent, though it looks like a descent; and these two\np rocesses are respectively re p resented by a line (re p resenting de-\nscent) of winding knots of s a n s k a r a s ,which goes u pf rom the\nstone stage to the gross world, and by a line (representing ascent)\nof unwinding knots of s a n s k a r a s ,which comes d o w nf rom the\ng ross world to the God state. The process of or d i n a ry re i n c a rn a-\ntions begins after the winding is complete; and it continues till the\nunwinding has begun.\nIn the process of realization, advanced souls from the first\nt h rough the third planes are conscious only of the subtle world,\nthrough their subtle bodies. They are aware of ordinary souls who\na re gross-conscious and can act upon them in the subtle world; but\nall this is done by them through the subtle body and in the subtle\nworld; and they have no connection with the gross world through\nthe gross body. In the same way , advanced souls from the fourt h\nt h rough the sixth planes are aware of gross-conscious as well as\nsubtle-conscious souls; but they act upon them in the mental world\nt h rough the mental body; and they have no connection with the\ng ross world through the gross body, nor with the subtle world\nt h rough the subtle body . There f o re, the lines in the chart connect\nthe subtle-conscious souls only with the subtle world; and the cor-\nresponding lines connect the mental-conscious souls only with the\nmental world.\nIn the God state, in which all the sanskaras are unwound, con-\nsciousness is turned only to God; this is the state of M a j z o o b s - e -\nK a m i l ,who have no connection with the gross nor the subtle nor\nthe mental worlds. But a few who enjoy the God-state also come\ndown and regain the consciousness of the entire Creation. These\nare the souls of the Masters. The soul of the Master is represented\nby seven concentric coloured rings.* The following points (which\nhave been brought out by connecting lines) should be car e f u l l y\nnoted: (i) The Master’s soul is connected with God Beyond, which\nis the vidnyan or the resting place of the Masters, (ii) it is connected\nwith the God state and (iii) it is not only connected with all the\nt h ree worlds, but all the souls, whether they are mental-c o n s c i o u s ,\ns u b t l e-conscious or re i n c a rnating human beings (who are gr o s s -\nconscious), or souls who are in the pre-human evolutionary stage.\nChart X\nChart X brings out the details pertaining to the process of evo-\nlution up to the human form and the process of realization up\nto the state of a God-realized being. The innermost small cir c l e\nwhich is referred to by “S” represents the individual soul. The soul\nis shown as having an increasing number of circles around itself\nup to the human stage; and it is shown as retaining all these circ l e s\nlater on. The second circle, which is next to the soul, r e p re s e n t s\nconsciousness, which goes on increasing up to the human for m ;\nbut afterw a rds it remains constant. In evolution, vegetables acquire\nthe most undeveloped instinct, but not the subtle body ,† w h i c h\n226 God Speaks Supplement\n* For their signiﬁcance see Chart X.\n† N e v e rtheless, in the gaseous or stone or metal or vegetable form the soul also iden-\nt i ﬁes itself, though unconsciously, with its most-ﬁnite subtle form and its most-\nﬁnite mental form. [See page 31 of text. Ed.] \n\ne m e rges in an undeveloped form in worms and reptiles. This subtle\nbody goes on developing until it is fully developed in the human\nf o rm. Side by side with the development of the subtle body , there\nis a simultaneous development of instinct. Intellect, in its par t i a l\ndevelopment, makes its first appearance at the stage of animals;\nbut the mental body appears only at the last stage r e p resented by\nthe human form.\nIn the human form, the ﬁrst innermost circle re p resents the in-\nd i v i d u a lsoul; the next outer circle re p resents full consciousness;\nand then the other outer circles (in the order in which they are\ndrawn) respectively represent (i) the seat of individuality, (ii) san-\nskaras or unexpressed desires, (iii) intellect, (iv) felt desires of the\nmental body , (v) subtle body (in which there is a partial expre s s i o n\nof desires) and (vi) the gross body (in which the desires come to\nbe fully expre s s e d). All the circles round the innermost circle of the\nsoul, with the exception of the first circle of consciousness, are\nlayers of consciousness. Of these layers, the outermost circle and\nthe circle next to it respectively represent the gross and the subtle\nbodies, while the other four layers around consciousness re p re s e n t\nfour functions of one mental body . Of these four functions of the\nmental body , two (i . e . ,felt desires and intellect) are usually in-\ncluded under mind; and the other two ( i . e . , s a n s k a r a sor unex-\np ressed desires and the seat of individuality) are included under\nthe ego. Thus, at the human stage, the soul, with its consciousness,\nhas three bodies, but six layers (including the gross layer known\nas the gross body).\nWhen (after re i n c a rnations) the human soul launches upon the\np rocess of realization, intellect is replaced by inspiration, which\nﬁnds its expression from the ﬁrst to the third plane; and from the\nf o u rth to the sixth plane, this inspiration is transformed into illu-\nmination.\nThe coloured rings or concentric circles re p resent the soul of a\nG o d-realized person, with all the vehicles at its disposal. In re s p e c t\nto this diagram, the following points should be carefully noted:\n(i) The three outer rings respectively re p resent the gross, subtle and\nthe mental bodies. We ﬁnd all these bodies also in ord i n a ry human\nbeings. (ii) In the God-realized person, there has emerged a new\n14  The Divine Theme 227\nspiritual body , known as the universal body or mahakarana \nsharir ,which is the seat of the universal mind. Just as water is con-\ntained in a cup, the universal mind may be said to be contained\nin the universal body. Ther e f o re, though the universal body and\nthe universal mind are r e p resented by two dif f e rent circles, they\na re i nseparable from each other. (The universal mind of the Mas-\nt e r, which works through his universal body , is in direct contact\nwith the mental bodies of all the individual souls in Creation; and\nit can, through these mental bodies, bring about any changes in the\nmental, subtle or gross worlds. Though the Master has a mental\nbody like ord i n a ry humans, he always works only through his uni-\nversal mind.) (iii) In the Master’s soul, the limited ego of the\nhuman stage is transmuted into the unlimited Ego, i.e., the feel-\ning of separateness and narrow individuality is replaced by the re-\nalization of unlimited, indivisible and all-c o m p rehensive existence.\n(iv) The soul of the Master is endowed with inﬁnite consciousness.\nThe full consciousness at the human stage does not reveal or ex-\np ress the inﬁnity of the soul, owing to the limitations of s a n s k a r a s ;\nbut in the God-realized person, this full consciousness is not lim-\nited by any sanskaras and, therefore, it reveals or expresses the in-\nﬁnity of the soul.\n15"

    "text": "The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba (70)\nMeher Baba says there are five spheres: (1) g ross, (2) s u b t l e ,\n(3) mental, (4) composite and (5) Real. The ﬁrst four concern re l a-\ntive existences and the ﬁfth one is composed of the one and only\nReal Existence.\nThe question of details is all the more important when a subject\nis beyond ord i n a ry human experience. On the one hand, more de-\ntails confuse one more, and less details explain things less. This gives\nrise to a variety of terms and expressions for use from dif f e re n t\nv i e wpoints and in diff e rent contexts. In the absence of underlying\nexperience, descriptions of the same one thing often sound con-\nt r a d i c t o ry . But in the light of relative experiences or the ﬁnal re a l i-\nzation of Truth, the very contradictions prove to be complementary\n228 God Speaks Supplement\ne x p ressions about the same one Truth. The facts and the fact of facts\nunderlying the ﬁve spheres will bear this out.\nThe ﬁrst, the gross sphere, although entirely depending for its\nexistence on the subtle, is distinctly diff e rent in very many re s p e c t s\nf rom the subtle. The gross sphere consists of numberless worlds,\nsuns, moons, stars, and in fact everything material from the cru d e s t\nto the ﬁnest. Some of the worlds in the gross sphere contain min-\nerals and vegetation only; some others contain countless embodied\nbeings also, and in some there are included human beings. The\npoint of prime importance in the gross sphere is our world (Eart h ) .\nH e re, amongst all other beings who are conscious in greater or lesser\nd e g ree of the gross, man with his full consciousness is superior to\nall other beings of all gross worlds. * But until man h e re a w a k e n s\nto the subtle, his full consciousness remains fully occupied with the\ng ross, even when he reads and thinks of spiritual subjects such as\nthe one discussed here .\nThe second, the subtle sphere, is the sphere of energ y, and al-\nthough it is divided into seven divisions, it is one world by itself.\nIts subsistence depends upon the mental sphere but it exists en-\nti rely independent of the gross sphere. In the parlance of time and\nspace, the domain of the gross sphere, with its inﬁnite space com-\nprising universes of innumerable suns, planets and worlds, includ-\ning our Earth, is but a speck as compared with the subtle sphere .\nThe path of Self-realization, the r a h-e-t a r i q a tof the Suﬁs and\nthe adhyatmic marg aof the Vedantists, consisting of seven planes\n15  The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba 229\n* This means also superior spiritually amongst all human beings of the gross sphere .\nMeher Baba tells us that of the three worlds in the gross sphere which are inhabited\nby human beings, ours (the Earth) is the one where man is the highest spiritually.\nHe explains that, whereas man on this Earth possesses in his personality equal de-\ng rees of head and heart (5 0 %head and 50% h e a rt), man on the other two worlds\npossesses 100% head, and 75% head and 25% h e a rt, re s p e c t i v e l y. Man, in the course\nof his reincarnations, is born on any one of the three worlds, but must ﬁnally take\nf o rm and r e i n c a rnate on this Earth to fulfill his divine destiny which is God-\nrealization. In the gross sphere, the Earth is the last and nearest stepping stone to\nthe Path. The two other worlds are most close to the Earth in the pattern of habi-\ntation. Altogether there are 18,000 worlds with life, but these two worlds and the\nEarth are akin to one another in the pattern of human life. \n( m u q a m sor s t h a n s), is the one and only bridge between the first\ns p h e re of the gross and the ﬁfth, the Real sphere. The path has its\nﬁrst three planes in the subtle, the second sphere.\nThe subtle sphere through its energ y, its angels, and above all\nt h rough man’s partial and full subtle-consciousness (human con-\nsciousness partly or fully freed from the gross, in the gross), while\npenetrating the gross sphere itself, also penetrates infinite space\nwith its suns, stars, planets and, in fact, every thing and every being\nin all the worlds within the gross sphere.\nThe unlimited diversity and intensity of subtle sights, sounds,\nfeelings and powers have no parallel in the gross sphere, save energ y\nwhich becomes limited within the bounds of the gross, and human\nconsciousness which is surrounded by gross limitations.\nThe third, the mental sphere, is the sphere of the spheres. It is\nabsolutely independent of both the subtle and gross spheres and\nis independently sustained by Divinity . The mental sphere is the\nv e ry abode of Mind, individual, collective and universal. The Mind\np e rvades its own sphere as much as it does throughout the subtle\nand gross spheres.\nThis sphere of the Mind includes everything relating to intel-\nlect, intuition, insight and illumination. Herein are also contained\nthe loftier planes of the Path, the fifth and the sixth. The four t h\nplane is but a junction between the third plane in the subtle sphere\nand the ﬁfth plane in the mental sphere.\nN e v e rtheless, the mental sphere does not and cannot touch the\nReal Sphere, as nothing can touch it save its own Reality , conscious\nof itself in the eternal “I am God” state of God.\nThe fourth, the composite sphere, is the most named and the\nleast understood one. It is composed of twenty-one sub-spher e s\nand as such it is both a sphere and not a sphere by itself.\nThe twenty-one connecting links are made up of seven sub-gro s s\nand sub-subtle spheres between the gross and the subtle spher e s ;\nseven sub-subtle and sub-mental spheres between the subtle and the\nmental spheres; and seven sub-mental and sub-supramental sphere s\nbetween the mental sphere and the Real Sphere .\nThe peculiar nature and position of the composite spherec o u l d\nbe grasped more easily through either of the following tables:\n230 God Speaks Supplement\nT able I\n1. Gross\n7 (lower)\n2. Subtle\n4. Composite 7 (middle)\n3. Mental\n7 (higher)\n5. Real\nT able II\n1. The Gross Sphere (First Sphere)\nSeven lower sub-spheres\nof\n4.

The Mental Sphere (Third Sphere)\nSeven higher sub-spheres\nof\n4. The Composite Sphere (Fourth Sphere).\n5. The Real Sphere (Fifth Sphere).\nThe seven lower sub- s p h e res are spiritually superior to the\ng ross sphere and they do touch the gross, whereas the seven higher\ns u b-s p h e res are neither spiritually superior to the mental sphere\nnor can they ever touch the Real Sphere as will be clear from fur-\nther details which follow.\nOn the one hand, the all- i m p o rtant Path, the one and only\nbridge between man and God, runs through the two spheres of the\nsubtle and the mental, and on the other hand, there are innumer-\nable things and beings in these two spheres as well as in between\nthe seven lower and seven higher sub-s p h e res, and each one of the\nthings and beings is directly or indirectly vital to the Path.\n15  The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba 231\n{\n232 God Speaks Supplement\nF rom the seven lower to the seven middle sub-s p h e res, inclu-\nsive of the subtle sphere, amongst other things there are the abodes\nof the disembodied souls (spirits) and the un-embodied souls (an-\ngels). From the seven middle to the seven higher sub-spheres, in-\nclusive of the mental sphere, amongst other things there is the abode\nof the archangels.\nThe spirits (disembodied souls), both good and bad, have to re-\nmain in the “state of waiting,” both before and after experiencing\nthe states of pleasure and pain—states commonly known as heaven\nand hell.37\nT\nhe angels (unembodied souls) are mere automatons for the\nwill of God and they do nothing which is not desired or prompted\nby God. These wishes happen to be mere expressions of divine pow-\ner and activity which are all- p e rvading. In short, angels are pure\nand not contaminated with physical embodiment. In this they are\nsuperior to the man whose consciousness has not extended beyond\nthe limitations of the gross (meaning a man not yet on the Path).\nP a r a d o x i c a l l y, man, the inferior, who has succeeded in being con-\ntaminated with physical embodiment, is actually the superior in\nthe strength of the potentialities latent within him. Experiencing\nhis imperfections, limitations and weaknesses, he is potentially ripe\nto realize his real strength and purity which are far above those\nof, and beyond the reach of, even the archangels.\nThe archangels are the mediums for the expression of God’s\nprincipal divine attributes of creating, pr e s e rving and destro y i n g\nlimited life on an unlimited scale, and of communicating unlimited\nKnowledge on a limited scale. The archangels are entities who al-\nways enjoy and never suffer.\nThe abode of the archangels, the sub-supramental spheres of\nthe fourth, the composite sphere which is discussed here, comes\nafter the third—the mental sphere—and is nearest the fifth, the\nReal Sphere. This is true, yet not the whole truth; for in spite of its\nproximity it cannot touch the Real Sphere. An archangel, from the\nhighest sub-supramental sphere, can never see God, whereas man\nin the sixth plane of the third, the mental sphere, can and does\nsee God face to face every w h e re and in everything. The last point\nof the last of the sub-supramental spheres is what the Sufis call the\ns a d r a t-u l-m u n t a h a(the last limit), beyond which, as is popularly\nand rightly believed by the Muslims, even the archangel Gabriel\ncannot go.\nMan has and man shall (because man alone can) jump over the\nlast seven links of the really non-existent relative existences of all\nthe four spheres into his really own—the ﬁfth, the Real Sphere. In\nshort, angels must necessarily cease to be angels and become man\nb e f o re they can reach the Reality attainable to man. And when man\nceases to be man and enters the “I am God” state, he realizes that\nangels and archangels are in fact his own attributes in one sense\nor a nother.\nFinally the dissolution of the higher seven sub- s p h e res of the\nf o u rth—the composite—sphere, is the phenomenon called q i a m a t\nor m a h a p r a l a y a ,and when this takes place the whole of the non-\nexistent existence of Creation, with all its spheres and sub-sphere s ,\nlike a manifested tree, recedes into the unmanifested seed form of\nn o n-existent non-existence, only to be manifested anew once more\nin the very next moment of eternity .\nThe fourth, the composite sphere, is commonly included in the\nﬁrst three spheres as follows:\n1. The gross sphere plus part of the fourth, the composite sphere ,\nis the a l a m-e-nasut of the Sufis and the anna bhuvan of the\nVedantists.\n2. The subtle sphere plus part of the fourth, the composite sphere ,\nis the a l a m-e-malakut of the Sufis and the pran bhuvan of the\nVedantists.\n3. The mental sphere plus part of the fourth, the composite\ns p h e re, is the a l a m-e-j a b rut of the Suﬁs and the mano bhuvan\nof the Vedantists.\nThe latter also call the three (including the fourth) spher e s\nc o llectively the t r i b h u v a n(triple sphere), and the Suﬁs call them\ncollectively do alam (two spheres) meaning the gross on the one\nhand, and the subtle and the mental (including the composite\nsphere) on the other hand.\nThe ﬁfth, the Real Sphere, is also the seventh plane of the Path,\nthe plane of full super-consciousness which, in simple wor d s ,\n15  The Five Spheres Described by Meher Baba 233\n234 God Speaks Supplement\nmeans the full human consciousness fully freed from any vestige or\ntinge of duality inherent in varying degrees in all of the four sphere s\nof relative existence. It would not be wrong to say that the f i f t h\ns p h e re or the seventh plane is neither any sphere nor plane but the\nR eality of God’s very Selfhood—re f e rred to by humanity as A l l a h ,\nP a r a m a t m a ,Almighty God, Ye z d a n ,and so on. According to the dif-\nferent states of the same one God from is to “I am God,” and from\n“I am God” to “I am everything,” there are diff e rent terms for the\nd i ff e rent stages or aspects of the Real Sphere—such as a l a m - e - h a h u t\nand alam-e-lahut of the Suﬁs or vidnyan bhumika and vidnyan.\n16"

    "topic": "The Types of Conviction and of Knowledge",
    "text": "The Types of Conviction and of Knowledge (73)\nAccording to the Suﬁs, the spiritual life consists of four stages,\nand man’s life on earth in all its aspects is but a preparation, con-\nscious or unconscious, for the ever-unfolding realms of knowl-\nedge and illumination that lead to God-realization. These four\nstages are s h a r i a t ( d h a rma shastra), t a r i q a t(adhyatma marg a), h a-\nq i q a t( G o d-realization or a i k y a) and m a re f a t-e-h a q i q a t(Gnosis or\nsatyanubhuti).\nImam Muhammad Ghazali has compared these four stages to a\nwalnut, which has four constituents: the outer skin or husk, the in-\nner skin or lining, the kernel, and the oil within. T o make the anal-\nogy more explicit, we may say that s h a r i a tis the outer husk, t a r i q a t\nthe inner lining, haqiqat the kernel, and marefat-e-haqiqat the oil.\nAs the aspirant advances through these four stages, he acquire s\nan ever-i n c reasing measure of certainty concerning Truth. These\nenduring certainties are known to the Suﬁs as:\n1. Ilm-ul-yaqin\n2a. Yaqin-ul-yaqin\n2b. Ain-ul-yaqin\n3. Haqq-ul-yaqin\n4. Urf-ul-yaqin\n1. I l m-u l-yaqin, or intellectual certainty (conviction), is derived\nthrough rock-like faith.\n2a. Ya q i n-u l-yaqin, or perceptual certainty through awareness of\nGod, is derived from inner feelings, visions or spiritual expe-\nriences on the Path. It is conviction of the soul on the ﬁrst up\nthrough the ﬁfth plane.\n2b. A i n-u l-yaqin, or visual certainty ( i . e . ,conviction by sight), is\nthe experience of actually seeing God every w h e re and continu-\nally; this is antar drishti.\n3. H a q q-u l-yaqin, or certainty of Realization (i.e., conviction by ac-\ntual experience), is attained by the soul on the seventh plane\nof the spiritual journ e y, which is h a q i q a t .H e re the soul re a l i z e s\nitself through itself. This state is aikya (union with God).\n4. U rf-u l-yaqin, or certainty of gnosis, concerns the perfection of d i-\nvinity in man by which man living the life of God knows all the\nmysteries of the Self and of the universe. The faculty br o u g h t\ninto play here is the universal mind ( s a rvabhaumic manas o r\naql-e-kull), which is the seat of all divine discrimination.\nT o illustrate these types of conviction still furt h e r, let us suppose\nthat a man comes to know that there is milk in a certain vessel. T o\nhave implicit faith in this knowledge through intellect and intuitive\np e rception is i l m-u l-y a q i nand y a q i n-u l-y a q i n. If he is not satisﬁe d\nwith this intellectual and intuitive conviction and actually takes the\nt rouble to go over to the vessel and see the milk with his own eyes,\nand thus feel convinced that the actuality tallies with his intellec-\ntual and intuitive knowledge, he experiences the certainty known\nas a i n-u l-y a q i n. To drink the milk, and to become to all intents and\npurposes one with it, gives him the experience of H a q q-u l-y a q i n ;\nand to ﬁnd within himself the knowledge of all that expresses and\nre p resents milk, such as sugar, water, fat, vitamins, etc., and to be\nable to describe these and the various uses of milk to others in de-\ntail, is the certainty of knowledge or gnosis, i . e . , u rf-u l-y a q i nw h i c h\nis the stage of m a re f a t-e-h a q i q a t.\nFive T ypes of Knowledge\nA c c o rding to the Suﬁs, there are ﬁve types of knowledge aff e c t-\ning human beings:\n16  The T ypes of Conviction and of Knowledge 235\n236 God Speaks Supplement\nThe first is the knowledge of the world, which is confined to\nthe attainment of material well-being.\nThe second is the knowledge o fs h a r i a t ,which is mostly used\nby those who have acquired it to over t h row their opponents\nwith the wordy warf a re of logic and argument. This knowledge\nis that of the exoteric divines.\nThe third type of knowledge is that of the spiritual Path; and\nit is found with those who have seriously taken to some inner\ndiscipline and have shunned the society of exoterics. In this\nknowledge the ego still persists, and the consciousness of\ngood and evil still clings to the soul. The knowledge of philo-\nsophers and thinkers is on the borderline between the second\nand third types of knowledge.\nThe fourth type of knowledge is that of God—the Self ( h a q i-\nq a t ) .One who arrives at this knowledge has no tinge of false\nego left and all vestige of duality disappears.\nThe ﬁfth type of knowledge is the real gnosis—the m a re f a to f\nhaqiqat, which, Meher Baba explains, is a complete knowledge\nof God and a complete knowledge of the universe. This is the\nknowledge of Perfection possessed by the Rasool (Avatar) and\nthe Qutub (Sadguru).\nUnless a soul goes through all the dif f e rent stages of knowl-\nedge, the highest stage of t a s a w w u f( Wisdom) which is s u l u k( re-\nt u rn to normal consciousness) can never be attained. Arriving at\nthis stage of gnosis entitles one to be called a perfect Suﬁ ( P e rf e c t\nMaster). There are, however, instances where persons have re a c h e d\nthe fourth stage of knowledge without going through the inter-\nm e d i a ry stages, but they are quite exceptional, and occur only\nwhen such persons are led by a Perfect Master.\nMeher Baba divides all spiritually advanced souls into ﬁve basic\ntypes: God-m e rged (Perfect One), God-intoxicated, God-absorbed,\nG o d-communed and God-mad. The reader is re f e rred to Chapter I,\npages 21–37 of Dr. William Donkin’s book The Wa y f a re r swhich de-\nlineates Baba’s treatment of this subject.\n17 Paramatma Is Inﬁnite and Everything (80)\nParamatma is Inﬁnite and Everything.\nAll atmas are in Paramatma.\nSome a t m a sexperience the gross world, some experience the\nsubtle world and some the mental world, and some experience\nParamatma.\nAs all a t m a sa re i nP a r a m a t m athey also have these diff e rent ex-\nperiences i nP a r a m a t m a. Those who experience (the experiencers)\nand the very experiences are all in P a r a m a t m a. Although the ex-\nperiencers and the experiences are in P a r a m a t m athey are not o f\nParamatma! They are of the Nothing.\nParamatma is the Everything, and the Nothing is in the Every-\nthing.\nHence, the atmas that are conscious of only sharir, pran or m a-\nnas a re not conscious of Self. In other words, such a t m a sa re con-\nscious of the Nothing and not of the Everything. Such a t m a s\ne xperience the gross, subtle or mental world and do not experience\nP a r a m a t m a. That is, they experience the Nothing and do not ex-\nperience the Everything. There f o re it can be said that the a t m a st h a t\na re i nP a r a m a t m aa re not conscious of the Self, and are not expe-\nriencing P a r a m a t m a ,but they are conscious of the Nothing and are\nof the Nothing, and they experience the Nothing.\nThese a t m a sidentify themselves with the Nothing so r e a l i s t i-\ncally that they apparently become Nothing.\nEvery being is Nothing personiﬁed.\nAll beings and things are personiﬁcations of the Nothing—that\nis in the Everything.\n18"

Nirvana and nirvikalpa are so closely linked that each\ncan be said to be the divine goal;\nfalse nothing =  false everything\nreal Nothing =  neither everything nor nothing\nreal Everything =  God the Inﬁnite.\nFalse nothing leads to false everything; and real Nothing leads\nto real Everything. False nothing is linked to false everything; and\nreal Nothing is linked to real Everything. Eventually false nothing\nends in false everything, and real Nothing ends in real Everything.\nI n d u a l i t y f a l s e n o t h i n g i s f a l s ee v e ry t h i n g .I n u n i t yre a l N o t h i n g\nand real Everything are one.\nMeher Baba has also made the following points:\n1. The real goal is to realize God in human form; but those who\nd rop their bodies before attaining God-realization ( i . e . ,t h o s e\nwho drop their bodies in the state of n i rvana b e f o re attaining\nthe state of n i rvikalpa), their goal is liberation (mukti) f rom the\ncycle of rebirth. They experience inﬁnite bliss only .\n2. The individuality of the one who attains n i rvikalpa state is re-\ntained as inﬁnite and unlimited even after dropping the human\nbody and there is a continuous experience of “I am God.” But\nthe one who attains mukti (liberation) experiences “I am a n a n d”\n20  Fana and Fana-Fillah 239\n(I am infinite bliss); and this limits his experience of unlim-\nited individuality of “I am infinite Power - K n o w l e d g e - B l i s s ”\ns imultaneously .\n3. Infinite knowledge is the most important aspect of the trio-\nn a t u re of God, when an individual realizes God in human\nf o rm. Infinite bliss remains the important aspect of one’s ex-\nperience when one has dropped one’s body in the state of n i r-\nvana and attains mukti, i.e., liberation as the goal.\n4. M a j z o o b-e-Kamil experiences inﬁnite Knowledge- P o w e r-B l i s s\nsimultaneously and when he comes down to normal con-\nsciousness, i.e., when he is also duality-conscious and is no\nmore in the state of Majzoob-e-Kamil, he not only experiences\nK n o w l e d g e-P o w e r-Bliss but also uses them while having his\nhuman body .\n21 The Suﬁ Conception of Fana and Baqa (131)\nThis is a short study of the terms fana and baqa as understood\nby the Sufis. Every plane has a fana and baqa of its own. It must\nbe re m e m b e red that the fana of the planes is not the fana of the sev-\nenth plane, and that the baqa of the planes is not the baqa of the\nQutub state—the state of perfection.\nThe following are some of the chief points of comparison in\nS u ﬁgnosis, and it will be seen that their exposition is mostly in re-\nlation to the seventh plane and that their terms have, of course, a\ntranscendental application.\nFana literally means effacement or annihilation. It is a state that\nis not permanent. \nBaqa literally means permanence and is a state that abides fore v e r.\nFana s i g n i ﬁes the end of travelling t o w a rds G o d .\nBaqa s i g n i ﬁes the beginning of travelling in G o d .\nFana i snot to be considered as an attribute; it is not like the\nd i ssolution of sugar in water. According to Hujwiri, it does not sig-\nnify the disappearance of essence.\nBaqa re p resents that which was not non-existent before, and\nwill not be non-existent afterwards, like the essence of God.\n240 God Speaks Supplement\nFana i sthe disappearance of the cognition of ghair (the other,\ni.e., duality).\nBaqa i sthe knowledge of God that one gains after the disap-\npearance of ghair .\nF a n aa c c o rding to Mahmud Shabistari in Gulshan-e-Raz, i s\ndeath of passion, of self-will and of the ego, resulting in the spiri-\ntual awakening to eternal life (baqa). It also means the forg e t f u l-\nness of the false ego (khudi) which has so long been concealing\nm a n ’s reality (God) from himself. If it occurs to the aspirant that he\nis effaced from self, it is a defect. The highest state is to be effaced\nfrom effacement.\nFana is of two kinds, outward and inward:\nOutward fana. This is the fana of deeds and the glory of divine\ndeeds. The possessor of this fana becomes so immersed in divine\ndeeds that he is oblivious of himself and of everything except of the\ndesire and the will of God. Some holy aspirants have attained this\nmuqam wherein they are so indifferent to physical needs that God\nappoints someone to look after them.\nI n w a rd fana. This is the fana of qualities in zat (Reality). The\npossessor of hal (experience) in the revelation of the attributes of\nGod is immersed sometimes in the fana of his own qualities, and\nsometimes in the manifestation of the influence (asar) and the\nglory (tajalli) of God.\nO u t w a rd fana i sa portion of the lords of the heart and of the\ncompanions of hal.\nI n w a rd fana i speculiar to the noble ones who have outgro w n\nthe sway of hal and have pierced the veil of the heart; and fr o m\nthe society of the men of the heart they have joined the society of\nthe converter of hearts (God).\nBaqa that is in relation to outward fana i sthis: After fana o f\ndesire and of will God makes the slave into a master of desire and\nwill and gives him absolute control of the reins of guidance.\nBaqa in relation to inward f a n ais this: The soul becomes nei-\nther God as the veil of Creation nor Creation, the veil of God. In\nfana God is the veil of Creation, and to those who have not re a c h e d\nthe state of fana, Creation is the veil of God.\n21  The Suﬁ Conception of Fana and Baqa 241\n242 God Speaks Supplement\n22 Involution of Consciousness (135)\nMeher Baba comments further:\n“Full consciousness, which is complete as soon as the first\nhuman form is taken, gradually withdraws, plane after plane. This\ninvolution of consciousness (which consciousness is already com-\nplete) begins for the ﬁrst time when the hard-set gross impre s s i o n s\nbecome thinned out. Consciousness thus experiences the ﬁrst plane.\nAs the impressions get thinned out still more the consciousness\nwithdraws (involves) more and experiences the second plane, and\nso forth until the seventh plane is attained. \n“ Withdrawal of consciousness means that at ﬁrst the conscious-\nness which was complete was focussed on gross impressions and far\nf rom being focussed on Self. Later on, in the process of involution,\nas the impressions thin out more and more gradually , with the help\nof diverse experiences of opposites, the consciousness also con-\nc u rrently shifts its focus gradually towards Self. In the seventh plane\nthe consciousness is no longer impressioned consciousness, and\nthis naturally results in the consciousness focussing upon its Self.\nThis means that the consciousness identiﬁes itself with Self as all\ni m p ressions have vanished.”\n23 Five Algebraic Deﬁnitions (137)\n1.

Since this mukti is attained without the body, the indi-\nvidual soul enjoys only bliss (anand); and although power and\nknowledge are there, such a Mukta cannot experience them.\nSuch a liberated soul is conscious only of the bliss of Union,\nand for him Creation no longer exists, thereby bringing to an\nend the constant round of births and deaths.\nN i rvikalpa samadhi must not be confused with this or d i-\nn a ry mukti or moksha state. Should a soul reach the mukti s t a t e ,\nit does so after the death of the physical body . Such a soul\nreaches God, but this occurs only after death. Thus there is an\ni m p o rtant distinction between ord i n a ry mukti on the one hand\n244 God Speaks Supplement\nand n i rvikalpa samadhi on the other, because the latter is ex-\np erienced while the soul retains the body and thus becomes\nVideh Mukta.\n2. Some God-realized souls known as Videh Muktas retain the\nbody for three or four days after becoming realized. Their con-\nsciousness is merged completely in their own Real Self (God),\nand they are not, there f o re, conscious of their bodies or of Cre-\nation. They experience constantly the inﬁnite bliss, power and\nknowledge of God, their own Self now , but they cannot con-\nsciously use them in Creation, nor help others to attain libera-\ntion. Nevertheless, their presence on earth, for the few days\nthey remain there, is a centre for the radiation of the infinite\np o w e r, knowledge and bliss of God; and those who appr o a c h\nthem, serve them and worship them are immensely beneﬁted.\nOthers retain the body for years according to the momentum\nof their “ p r a r a b d h a.” The Videh Mukta is the Brahmi Bhoot, o r\nthe M a j z o o b-e-Kamil of the Suﬁs, and he experiences the trio-\nnature of God—sat-chit-anand—automatically .\n3. The Jivanmukta ( A z a d-e-M u t l a q )in turiya avastha (fana-ma-al-\nb a q a )enjoys All-Bliss, All-Knowledge and All- P o w e r, and his\nconsciousness is of the “I am God” state, and also of the thre e\ns p h e res—the gross, subtle and mental; but, being without duty ,\nhe does not use the bliss, knowledge and power for others.\n4. The Param Mukta, who is known as the Perfect Master, Qutub\nor S a d g u ru, comes back to normal consciousness after God-\nrealization, and is simultaneously conscious of the “I am God”\nstate and the three relative existences and their corresponding\ns p h e res. He not only enjoys All- P o w e r, All-Knowledge, All-\nBliss, but uses them in all the planes of existence through the\nuniversal mind and the universal body .\nSuch Param Muktas a re conscious of themselves as God,\nboth in His unmanifest and manifest aspects. They know them-\nselves both as the unchangeable divine essence (zat) and as the\ninﬁnitely varied manifestations (sifat). They experience them-\nselves as God apart from Creation; as God the Cre a t o r, Pre s e rv e r\n26"

Ed.]\n26 Signs of Perfection (141)\nIn answer to a question by a disciple requesting some infallible\nmethod of recognizing a Perfect Master, Meher Baba explained:\n“An ord i n a ry man may not be able to discriminate satisfactorily\nbetween the diff e rent stages of spiritual attainment up to the sixth\nplane. He may be able to know that such souls are advanced, but not\nthe extent of their advancement. But when a sincere and pa t i e n t\nType of Mukti Consciousness Duty in Duality\nOrdinary Mukti Anand (bliss) only; no conscious- No\nness of “I am God” or of duality .\nVideh Mukti “I am God” (sat-chit-anand or No\nKnowledge, Power and Bliss) \nwithout consciousness of duality .\nJivanmukti “I am God” (sat-chit-anand) No\nwith consciousness of duality.\nParam Mukti Simultaneously “I am God” Yes\n(sat-chit-anand) with duality \nand divinity in action.\n246 God Speaks Supplement\nseeker of Truth comes into contact with one who is spiritually per-\nfect, he will observe certain outer signs that are inseparably asso-\nciated with inner spiritual per f e c t i o n .\n“The most important of these signs are three: ﬁrstly, Perfection\nis not only ‘Oneness with God,’ but the continual and uninter-\nrupted experience of ‘Oneness in everything.’ A Perfect Master\nc o n t i n u a l l y, without break, experiences and realizes his own Self\nas the Self in all. This inner experience objectively manifests it-\nself in the spontaneity of love that such a one feels or expresses to-\nw a rds all Creation. T o him nothing is attractive or repulsive. Good\nand bad, saint and sinner, beauty and ugliness, wisdom and idiocy ,\nhealth and disease—all are modes of his own manifestation. When\nembodied Perfection loves, fondles or feeds any living cre a t u re, it\nfeels and enjoys as if it were loving, fondling and feeding its own\nSelf. In this stage no vestige of ‘otherness’ is left.\n“The second sign is the atmosphere of bliss that Perfection ra-\ndiates in its immediate vicinity , an atmosphere that a stranger in\ns e a rch of it cannot help feeling. A Perfect Master not only enjoys in-\nﬁnite bliss but also experiences universal suffering. The acuteness\nof suffering however is nulliﬁed or subdued by the overw h e l m i n g\nfeeling of bliss. Hence Perfection can outwardly appear blissfully\ncalm in the face of every kind of suffering and persecution.\n“The third sign of Perfection is its power to adapt itself to any\nlevel of humanity . It can be as nonchalant on a throne as in a gutter.\nIt can very naturally be thrifty with the poor, extravagant with the\nrich, regal with kings, wise with the learned and simple with the il-\nliterate and the ignorant. Just as a Master of Letters teaches English\nin diff e rent ways to beginners and graduate students, so also a Per-\nfect Master adapts himself to the level of those whom he wants to\nuplift spiritually .”\nOnce Ghaus Ali Shah Qalander, while discoursing on spiritual\np e rfection (faqiri), said, “Giving perfection to a disciple is a matter\nof a fraction of a second. A word in the ear is enough to lift a man\nat once from ﬁniteness to inﬁn i t y, and such a transformation is not\ndependent on prayers or fasts.”\nMaulana Rumi has said:\nDad-i ura qabiliyat-i sharv nist\nBalkih sharv-i qabiliyat dad-i ust.\n“Divine Grace is not limited by conditions of ability .\nAbility , in fact, is conditioned by Divine Grace.”\nHearing this, one of the disciples remarked, “Sire, if re a l i z a t i o n\nbe so easy of attainment, then why is it that disciples are invariably\nmade to undergo a long period of trials and austerities?” In r e p l y,\nGhaus Ali Shah related the following anecdote:\n“A certain man, having two vessels encrusted with the rust and\nd i rt of many years, decided to have them cleansed. He gave one ves-\nsel to a professional who promised to cleanse it in forty days, and\nthe other to a man who undertook to do the job in a single day . The\np rofessional began to work at his vessel scientiﬁc a l l y. He subjected\nit to many diff e rent processes over a period of forty days, and he\nmade the vessel not only spick and span but also a thing ﬁt for use.\n“The second man, who had promised to ﬁnish the job in one\nd a y, adopted the very drastic pro c e d u re of burning the vessel in a\nhuge ﬁre. This cleansed the vessel quickly and completely , but made\nit brittle and worthless. It can be seen, there f o re, that although both\nthe vessels were made clean, only that which underwent the lengthy\np rocess was of any use.”\nThe Master went on to say that it was for this reason that a Per-\nfect Master seldom gave realization to an aspirant instantaneously,\nbut led him to it slowly so that he might become a robust, useful\nvessel for God’s work.\nIn this connection, Meher Baba once remarked to his disciples,\n“Realization can be imparted to anyone in a second. It will then\nbe for one’s own self only with no beneﬁt to others. The period of\na u s t e r i t y, self-denial and hardship which one undergoes with a\nM a s t e r, engenders power and gives authority to use Realization,\nwhen achieved, for the spiritual awakening of others.”*\n26  Signs of Perfection 247\n* [See also Meher Baba, “Perfection,” Discourses, 7 8 – 8 2, for the understanding of the\nd i ff e rence between spiritual perfection and the relative perfection pertaining to the\ndomain of duality .

    "text": "Hal and Muqam (141)\nH e re is a gist of hal (experience) and muqam (stage) in the light\nof Suﬁ gnosis. Some Suﬁs believe there is no appreciable diff e re n c e\nbetween hal and muqam; they maintain that every muqam is hal at\nthe beginning and develops into muqam at the end. This applies\nto all the planes included in the subtle and mental spheres. Many\nhowever distinguish hal from muqam.\nAccording to Abdullah Haris Muhasibi of Basra:\nHal i sthe gift of God; it is as ﬂeeting as lightning, and is secure d\nby practice (mujahida).\nM u q a mis the result of repentance, and is secured by the con-\nstant overshadowing of hal.\nThe author of Awarif-ul-Maarif has it thus:\nHal s i g n i ﬁes a hidden event that descends from the upper world\nupon the heart of the pilgrim, and keeps going and coming until\nthe divine attraction draws him from the lowest to the highest level.\nMuqam i sthe station on the Path at which the pilgrim arrives. It\nbecomes the place of his stay until he advances furt h e r.\nHal is not under the control of the pilgrim; the pilgrim is con-\ntrolled by it.\nMuqam is in the traveller’s sway .\nHal is a gift (maohib).\nMuqam is an acquisition (kasb).\nHal can never be without being related to muqam.\nMuqam can never be without being related to hal.\nSheikh Mohammed Ibrahim, also known as Ghazur-e-Ilahi, in\nhis Irshadat says:\nWhen hal continues, it becomes muqam. Whoever gets hal o n c e\nis a beginner, and whosoever continues in it becomes an adept.\nMeher Baba explains that:\nIn the general sense of the word, hal i sthe inner experience\n(which includes ecstasy , both controlled and uncontrolled) of re l a-\ntive existences on the ﬁrst through the sixth planes (stages) of the\nPath. In the particular sense, hal i sthe state of divine ecstasy and is\nalways experienced in degrees of potency according to its re l a t i v e\nmuqam. Hal in Vedanta is called bhav and muqam is called sthan.\nM u q a mis the staying of the pilgrim on a given plane, in that\nparticular hal.\nHal and muqam go together up to and onto the sixth plane. H a l\nalways dominates muqam.\nHal and muqam do not exist on the seventh plane.\nW h e re there is hal t h e re is duality . When one from the seventh\nplane comes down to normal consciousness and establishes himself\non any plane for the sake of duty , then that particular plane becomes\nhis muqam. Thus for the Qutub (Sadguru) t h e re is no hal, t h e re is\nonly muqam. O rd i n a ry men, who are by nature emotional, can enjoy\no rd i n a ry hal while listening to music, but this is a pseudo-h a land is\nnot to be compared with the spiritual hal of a pilgrim on the Path.\n28"

    "text": "The Avatar and the Sadguru (150)\nThe sense Meher Baba wishes to convey is: “When a S a d g u ru i s\nsaid to be in good health or ill, all this is said and seen and felt by\no rd i n a ry human beings. The underlying truth from the point of\nview of the S a d g u ru i sthat neither good health nor illness nor any-\nthing whatsoever affects (touches) his being (inﬁnity) in the least,\nbecause he is perfectly conscious (fully aware) of Illusion as illu-\ns o ry and is thus fully aware that health and illness are both illusory\n(i.e., they are the outcome of the Nothing).\n“How could the Nothing ever affect him? The S a d g u ru has over-\ncome the impressions of Nothing through the process of evolu-\ntion, re i n c a rnation and involution, and he has realized that he is the\nE v e rything (which, of course, includes the Nothing). Even though\nthe Sadguru remains within the law of Creation, the law itself does\nnot touch him.\n“ ‘ S a d g u ru’ means that man has become God. There f o re, when\nman has become God he can no longer be man, and if he has to\nlive as man he has to act, behave or appear like a man by sponta-\nneously putting into action, that is, demonstrating, all the natural\ntendencies of man.\n“Being a Perfect Master, the S a d g u ru enacts the part (or plays the\nrole, or lives through the role) so perfectly on all levels and in all\nplanes that, under all circumstances and in all other respects, he a p-\npears to ord i n a ry human beings as if he were a man amongst men\nof the gross world. He also appears as if he were one of the men in\nthe subtle planes for those who are in the subtle planes, and to those\nwho are in the mental planes he appears as if he were one of them.\n“The S a d g u ru i ssimultaneously on the level of the lowest and\nof the highest. On one hand he is established in inﬁnity (Reality)\nand on the other hand he is the master of Illusion. Thus the S a d g u ru\nhas under his sway the two extremes, and reconcilement between\nthe two extremes could only be established and maintained thro u g h-\nout all interm e d i a ry stages and states by the S a d g u ru acting on all\nplanes and on all levels simultaneously .\n“In the case of the Av a t a r, the story is quite diff e rent. All the dif-\nf e rence is contained in the fact that S a d g u ru means man becoming\n30  The Avatar and the Sadguru 251\n252 God Speaks Supplement\nGod, while Avatar means God becoming man. It is very difficult to\ngrasp the entire meaning of the word ‘ Av a t a r.’ For mankind it is\neasy and simple to declare that the Avatar is God and that it means\nthat God becomes man. But this is not all that the word ‘ Av a t a r ’\nmeans or conveys.\n“It would be more appropriate to say that the Avatar i s G o d\nand that God becomes man for all mankind and simultaneously\nGod also becomes a sparrow for all sparrows in Creation, an ant for\nall ants in Creation, a pig for all pigs in Creation, a particle of dust\nfor all dusts in Creation, a particle of air for all airs in Creation, etc.,\nfor each and everything that is in Creation.\n“When the ﬁve S a d g u rus e ffect the presentation of the Divinity\nof God into Illusion, this Divinity pervades the Illusion in ef f e c t\nand presents Itself in innumerable varieties of form s — g ross, subtle\nand mental. Consequently in Avataric periods God mingles with\nmankind as man and with the world of ants as an ant, etc. But the\nman of the world cannot perceive this and hence simply says that\nGod has become man and remains satisﬁed with this understand-\ning in his own world of mankind.\n“Whatever be the understanding of man, the fact remains that\nthe Avatar becomes and the Sadguru acts.\n“The Av a t a r ’s illness has nothing to do with the taking on of\nk a rma of individuals. As the Avatar i sGod Who has become man\nin all respects, there is no reason why He should not be susceptible\nto all the natural tendencies of a human being. After all, God has\nbecome man and He is man indeed. But although the Avatar a c-\ntually becomes ill, as a man who falls ill, it must be r e m e m b e re d\nthat He also has simultaneously the background of His infinite\npower, knowledge and bliss.\n“The Avatar never takes on the k a rma of individuals but His\nGodhood functions universally.”\n31"

One cycle lasts for about 700 to about 1400 years and is made\nup of 11 ages. Each age lasts for about 65 to 125 years, its length,\nlike the length of a cycle, depending on material, spiritual and\nuniversal circumstances.\n2 . In each age the functioning hierarchy consists of 7,000 s p i r i-\ntual beings (either advanced or perfect).

This means that in the ﬁrst, third, ﬁfth, seventh and ninth\nages, four out of the seven Majzoobs die at once after Realization,\nand that in the eleventh and ﬁnal age, in which there are six perf e c t\nMajzoobs, three die at once after Realization. \nThe result is that in any given age only three Majzoobs remain\nin the body. Thus from the point of view of the functioning h i e r-\narchy there are really only three Majzoobs in each age. \nMeher Baba distributes the 7,000 members of the f u n c t i o n i n g\nh i e r a rchy for a particular age in and between the seven spiritual\nplanes as follows: \n32  Meher Baba on the Hierarchy 255\n256 God Speaks Supplement\nIn the ﬁrst plane, and also between 1st and 2nd, between 2nd and\n3rd, between 3rd and 4th, between 4th and 5th, between 5th and\n6th and between 6th and 7th  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,600\nIn the second plane . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 666\nIn the third plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 558\nIn the fourth plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56\nIn the ﬁfth plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56\nIn the sixth plane  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56\nIn the seventh plane (i.e., Majzoobs in the body)  . . . . . . . . 3\nPerfect Masters (Sadgurus)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        5\n7,000\nThe Avatar , in the eleventh age of each cycle, brings\nthe number to  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,001\nT h e re are always, at all times and in all ages, fifty-six God-\nrealized souls or S h i v-Atmas in human form on earth; and out of\nthese ﬁf t y-six only eight have public recognition and function as\nactive members of the functioning spiritual hierarc h y, consisting of\n7,000 members, who do the assigned spiritual duties on various\nplanes of consciousness according to their spiritual advancement\nor perfection.\nThe remaining fort y-eight God-realized ones are not amongst\nthe functioning spiritual hierarchy of 7,000 members.

    "topic": "Tauhid or the Unitary State of God",
    "text": "Tauhid or the Unitary State of God (159)\nThe principle involving tauhid, or the unitary state of God, is\nindisputable. It is the basic foundation of all known religions and\nthe goal of spiritual discipline in both Suﬁsm and Vedanta. To ac-\ncept tauhid in theory is the privilege of the masses, but to indulge\nin research thereof is the specialty of the select few. It is both easy\nand difﬁcult. T auhid i sseemingly so easy that it is talked about uni-\nversally on pulpit and platform and yet it is so difﬁcult of achieve-\nment that the best of efforts therein yield nothing but stupefaction\nand bewilderment.\nThe unity of God, in its transcendent aspect, is the t a u h i d - e -\ntanzihi (Absolute Oneness) of Suﬁsm, and the advaita of Ve d a n t a .\nThe problem of tauhid p resents multifarious aspects, as is exem-\np l i ﬁed by the old story of several blind people examining an ele-\nphant. Each touched a diff e rent part of the cre a t u re and formed a\nd i ff e rent opinion. Individual approach to the subject is r e l a t i v e l y\nquite true and unchallengeable, and yet the elephant as a whole\nis something quite dif f e rent and ununderstandable for the blind.\nThe following are a few utterances of eminent Sufis concer n i n g\ntauhid and the aspects thereof which appeal to them:*\n258 God Speaks Supplement\n* The apparent contradictions in the words of Sufis are merely due to limitations\nof the means to express the experienced truths and to describe the realized Tru t h\nin diff e rent contexts, under dif f e rent circumstances and from dif f e rent points of\nview that always go together in a single experience or realization as a whole. Meher\nBaba says that such wordy dif f e rences do not contradict but complement the ex-\np ressions of experienced and realized truths which underlie such contradictions.\nExplanations in this respect such as have already been given in preceding pages\nshould therefore be always borne in mind, viz.:\nT auhid is that reality in which the impressions (nuqush) a re\nwiped out, and knowledge appears and God remains as im-\nmaculate and pure as He was before.\n—Junayd of Baghdad\nT auhid is the knowledge of God and this knowledge enables\nthe gnostic to dif f e rentiate between the original ( q a d i m )\nand the contingent (hadas) being. The transcendent state\nof tauhid involves the denial of tauhid.\n—Junayd of Baghdad\nT auhid is the effacement of the lover in the attributes of the\nbeloved. —Jehangir Samnani\nT auhid has two aspects: one is the state and the other is the de-\nscription of it. The descriptive aspect of tauhid belongs to the\nworldly mission of the Prophets, and the state thereof involves the\ni n ﬁnite and boundless ocean. The descriptive aspect depends on\nthe instrumentality of speech, sight, hearing and cognition, and all\nof these re q u i re separate conﬁrmation. T o conﬁrm on the basis of\nextraneous proofs is to suggest duality , and tauhid i s f ree of all tinge\nof duality . Faith in a man walks through the crowded thoro u g h f a re\nof duality , and this stage cannot altogether be dispensed with.\nDescriptive tauhid i slike a lamp, while tauhid in itself and by it-\nself is the sun. When the sun appears, the light of the lamp vanishes\ninto nothingness. Descriptive tauhid is changeable, while the s t a t e\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 259\nPage 193: The approach to Truth is individual, and so in the matter of details much\ndepends upon one’s spiritual tendency , physical aptitude and external circ u m s t a n c e s .\nPage 198: A thousand seekers may be enjoying as many experiences, yet the Path\nof Gnosis is only one.\nPage 207: In spite of the dif f e rent aspects of the experiences of the Experience,\nall the aspects are experienced together at the same time.\nPage 228: On the one hand, more details confuse one more, and less details explain\nthings less. This gives rise to a variety of terms and expressions for use from dif-\nf e rent viewpoints and in diff e rent contexts. In the absence of actual experience, de-\nscriptions of the same one thing often sound contradictory . But in the light of\nrelative experiences or the ﬁnal realization of Truth, these very contradictions pro v e\nto be really complementary expressions about the same one truth.\nof tauhid i simmutable and eternal. The words uttered by the tongue\na re overruled by the heart. When one on the spiritual journey oc-\ncupies the station of the heart the tongue becomes defunct and mute.\nLater on the heart, too, is overridden by the spirit (jan), and at this\nstage the wayfarer talks to Him. This talk is not in relation to the\nessence, but in relation to its attribute. The attribute changes and not\nthe essence (ayn). The sun warms up the water, whereby the at-\ntribute is changed but not the water. Thus, “the very attempt to af-\nﬁrm tauhid i sto deteriorate the pristine purity of t a u h i d” (’Asb a t\nu t - t a uh id, fas i dun fit-t a uh id ) .\nT auhid veils for the unitarian (mawahid) the beauty of Absolute\nOneness (jamal-e-ahadiyat). Tauhid on that account is suspect, be-\ncause you desire it from yourself.\nOne who writes about tauhid is a mulhid (rationalist); one\nwho points towards it is a dualist; one who infers it is an\nidolator; one who talks about it is irresponsible; one who\nis silent about it is ignorant; one who thinks that he has re-\nalized it is self-deluded; one who imagines its nearness is\ndistant from it; one who weighs it with intellect, and form s\nideas thereof, is indulging in make-believe; and the one who\nﬁnds it without seeking is the lost one.\n—Abu Bakr Shibli \nT auhid, if spoken of in relation to absolutism (tanzeeh) i s\nto qualify it, and to refer to it as qualiﬁed (tashbeeh) is to\nmake it limited and ﬁnite. To equilibrate the two extre m e s\nis, however, perfect and just what is desirable.\n—Muhyuddin Ibn Arabi\nT auhid is essentially forgetfulness of tauhid. Those re t u rn-\ning to normal consciousness must needs have some work on\nthe material plane. Hence tauhid may be likened to a cre d i-\ntor that can never be adequately and fully paid off in life.\n—Quduntul-Kubra\nT auhid, the unitarian stage of God, there f o re admits of no lan-\nguage, as in that transcendent state there is none to whom to ad-\ndress oneself.\n260 God Speaks Supplement\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 261\nThe Sufis have classified tauhid into five main categories, in\nkeeping with or connoting the dif f e rent stages of man’s spiritual\nunfoldment. They are known as:\n1. T auhid-e-aqwali—the verbal unity of God.\n2. T auhid-e-afa’ali—the active unity of God.\n3. T auhid-e-ahwali—the feeling unity of God.\n4. T auhid-e-sifati—unity of God in attributes.\n5. T auhid-e-zati—unity of God in essence.\n1. Ta u h i d-e-aqwali belongs to the majority of mankind who be-\nlieve in any one Prophet ( Avatar) and have faith in His mes-\nsage. At this stage mere verbal acceptance of God or the unity\nof God, and the perf o rmance of duties pertaining thereto en-\njoined by the lawgiver, are considered enough as a preparation\nfor the forthcoming stages of spiritual life. This is also known\nas tauhid-e-shariat.\n2. Ta u h i d-e-afa’ali c o n c e rns those who have actually been initi-\nated into the Path. The expression of the unity of God with\nsuch initiates of the subtle sphere ( a l a m-e-malakut) s i m u l a t e s\nintrinsically the life of the pure souls, the angels. At this stage\nthe spiritual conviction engendered within is that behind\neverything, good or bad, is the motivating power of God.\n3. Ta u h i d-e-ahwali dawns on those advanced souls of the fifth\nplane in the mental sphere. At this stage the soul finds itself\ni nvested with direct radiation of Divinity and consciously or\nunconsciously gives immense help to others in the subtle and\ngross spheres.\n4. Ta u h i d-e-sifati belongs to the sixth plane in the same sphere\n(mental). All the aspects of materiality from the gross and\nsubtlety from the subtle planes, still clinging to the soul, are\ncompletely removed and dissolved, like the lustre of stars get-\nting dissipated before the sun. Both (3) and (4) tauhid b e l o n g\nto the same mental sphere ( a l a m-e - j a b rut) and all the three ( 2 ),\n(3) and (4) are also collectively known as tauhid-e-tariqat.\n5 . Ta u h i d-e-zati is God-realization in the fifth Real sphere of\nhaqiqat, which includes the dif f e rent stages or aspects of the\n262 God Speaks Supplement\nm a re f a t-e-haqiqat, viz., halat-e-Muhammadi in the stage of l a h u t ,\nand h a q i q a t-e-Muhammadi in the stage of hahut of the sphere\nof Reality.\nThe Suﬁs are unanimous on the point that amongst the vari-\nous aspects inherent in the realization or t a u h i d-e-zati, the most\np e rfect one is the accentuation of the dif f e rence of ubudiyat ( s e r-\nvantship) between man and God. This spiritual fact the church has\nm i s c o n s t rued and misapplied, in adducing that man is man and\nGod is God, and that man can never become God nor can God ever\ndevolve into man. The truth underlying the situation, however, is\nthat after the realization of t a u h i d-e-zati the emphasis on u b u d i -\nyat ( s e rvantship) connotes the third journey of the Saliks c a l l e d\ns e y r-e-ma Allah, the re t u rn to normal consciousness with G o d .\nThe varying stages and aspects of tauhid as discussed above are\ngiven below in tabular form:\nWujudiyyah and Shuhudiyyah\nAmongst the various types of unitarians ( a h l-e-t a u h i d), t h e\nmost important and controversial are the two schools of thought\nknown as Wujudiyyah and Shuhudiyyah.\nMuhyuddin Ibn Arabi is the greatest advocate of the Wu j u d i y-\nyah school, upholding w a h d a t-u l-wujud (unity of existence), which\nin Vedanta is Advaitism, upheld by its greatest exponent Sankara-\ncharya. According to Ghazur-e-Ilahi, Ibn Arabi held that existence\nStages\nT auhid-e-Aqwali\nT auhid-e-Afa’ali\nT auhid-e-Ahwali\nT auhid-e-Sifati\nT auhid-e-Zati\nSpheres\nAlam-e-Nasut\n(First Sphere)\nAlam-e-Malakut\n(Second Sphere)\nAlam-e-Jabrut\n(Third Sphere)\n1.

Ashiq (lover) and Mashuq\n(beloved) simultaneously\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 263\n(wujud) i snot more than one, and is the very same, is manifest to\nitself by itself, like water which is manifest to itself in the form of\nice by way of limitation. When in the state of fana, the limitation\n(the form) disappears, the Absolute remains and becomes Hu Hu\n(He, He).\nSheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardi, one of the chief sponsors of\nthe Shuhudiyyah school, characterizing its philosophy as w a h d a t -\nu l-shuhud ( a p p a rentism), the Vishistadvaita of Vedanta, maintains\nthat in fana, bandah (the limited) becomes kaanahu Hu (like Him)\nand not Hu Hu (He, He), as iron in the fire, which becomes like\nﬁre but not ﬁre itself—the reality of iron being quite diff e rent fro m\nthat of ﬁre. The Shuhudiyyahs deﬁne two different existences (zat)\nand two distinct things in view—iron and ﬁre. The iron becomes\nﬁre temporarily and then iron is iron and ﬁre is ﬁre.\nM i rza Jan Janan says that the relationship between the unmani-\nfest aspect of God and the manifest aspect of God is that which ex-\nists between the ocean, the waves and the bubbles. And this\nmultiplicity does not in any way affect or interf e re with the Oneness\nof Reality . This is w a h d a t-u l-wujud (identityism). In contrast w i t h\nthis, the other position determining the relationship between God\nand the created, as that of the original and its shadow or the sun\nand its rays, is wahdat-ul-shuhud (apparentism).\nWa h d a t-u l-wujud of Muhyuddin Ibn Arabi is from the heights\nof ahadiyat (conscious unity), and the gnosis pertaining to this\nstage is, therefore, “Hama ust” (Everything is He).\nWa h d a t-u l-shuhud of Sheikh Shahabuddin Suhrawardi, also\nknown as Mujaddid, is f rom the same heights of Reality ( h a q i q a t ) ,\nbut the gnosis expressed is “Hama az ust” ( E v e rything is from Him).\nThe two doctrines and the resultant controversies are a later de-\nvelopment at the beginning of the present d a o r-e-qalandari ( c y c l e\nof mastery), and so did not arise during the lifetime of the Arabian\nP rophet. The doctrine of the Wujudiyyahs is based on experience\nplus reason and the Shuhudiyyahs base it on experience and the\nQuranic aspects of common interest.\nIbn Arabi denies transcendence and immanence, which imply\nd u a l i t y. He maintains that God is one and it is He alone Who exists.\nAll else that appear to exist are His manifestations or t a j a l l i y a t .\n264 God Speaks Supplement\nHence God is identical with sifat (attributes), and all divine names\na re identical with the named, which is Allah. The saints who belong\nto the Wujudiyyah school of thought have their eyes on the oneness\nof existence ( w a h i d-u l-w u j u d), the first tajalli (manifestation) of\nGod, from the stage of ahadiyat; and there f o re the later devolutions\n(v i z . ,mental, subtle and gross worlds) are like a shadow (zil) w h i c h\nis nothing and as such constitutes an adumbration on zat ( d i v i n e\nessence). The shadow (zil), h o w e v e r, owes its existence to and is de-\npendent upon God, Who is inﬁnite and eternal. Thus the shadow\nalso is in the sense that the Wujudiyyahs look upon everything as\nGod, even the shadows (mental, subtle and gross worlds) which\nhave no independent existence.\nThe Shuhudiyyahs, as said before, hold two zats, the one of re-\nality and the other of non-re a l i t y, the one of God and the other of\nbandah. The zat of bandah is zero (adum) and this adum ( n o t h i n g-\nness) is relational ( i z a ﬁ), and is not real (haqiqi). If nothing ( a d u m )\nis to be considered as an essence (Reality), then there will be two\nzats, which results in dualism. The a d u m - e-i z a ﬁis only relatively an\nadum (nothing). It is mere zero. If any number of zeroes are added\nto a zero the value of the number does not change. Thus adum i s\nt h e re f o re a symbol in the knowledge of God. Since perf e ction ap-\np e rtains to zat, God is Perfection itself. Imperfection relates to\nadum and hence “evil” is the manifestation of adum ( n o n -e x i s t e n t\nexistence). The Mujaddid only re a fﬁrmed and reemphasized the\ndoctrine of wahdat-ul-shuhud ( a p p a re n t i s m), originally founded by\nAbdul Karim al-Jili, the author of Al-lnsan-ul-Kamil.\nThe spiritual fact, however, is that Wujudiyyah philosophy is of\na loftier kind and admits of no considerations of convenience or\nc o m p romise. The gnosis of Meher Baba is equally applicable to\nboth these approaches to Truth and in order to follow it as given\nin the “T en States of God” some familiarity with the Suﬁ way of de-\nlineating the t a n a z z u l a t —the devolutions of the Absolute—thro u g h\nsuccessive stages of manifestations known as khamsa wujudat ( F i v e\nExistences) of the Suﬁ world would be of help to the seeker.\nThe Gnosis of all Perfect Suﬁs implies that God in the Beyond the\nBeyond state is unknowable and undeﬁnable. In compr e h e n d i n g\nthis state of God (Wara-ul-Wara) which is Beyond the Beyond, the\nwings of thought and imagination are paralyzed. In the Beyond the\nBeyond state, the Absolute God (Wujud-e-Mutlaq) is.\nThe Suﬁs have described this transcendent state of God in many\nways, such as:\nGhaib-ul-Ghaib (the Hidden of the Hidden).\nMajhul-un-Nat (the Unknowable and the Undeﬁnable). It is in\nthis state that there is no knowledge of Itself for zat.\nM u n q a t a-u l-I z h a r a t(the state in relation to which all indica-\ntions are dropped).\nAl Ama (the Dark Mist) which implies a state of latent poten-\ntiality of God in relation to its inward aspect of Beyond the Be-\nyond, and in its outward aspect of ahadiyat (conscious Oneness)\nin which zat is aware of its transcendent Unity .\nMeher Baba explains that although God from the Beyond state\n(conscious Oneness) cannot re t u rn to the Beyond the Beyond state,\nHe knows that He was a n dis Infinite Existence, Infinite Knowl-\nedge and Inﬁnite Bliss and from that knows that His original state\nwas the Beyond-Beyond state (Zat-al-Baht).\nH o w e v e r, with a view to making the subject intelligible to the\nseekers, the Sufis have treated the Divine Theme in terms of de-\nvolutions or manifestations of ﬁve different types, thus:\nKhamsa Wujudat or Five Kinds of Existence\n1. Wa h i d-u l-wujud ( U n i t a ry Existence) is the ﬁrst manifestation or\nt a j a l l i-e-avval in the a l a m-e-lahut of the Real Sphere and com-\nprises the stage of ahadiyat (conscious Oneness).\n2 . A r i f-u l-wujud (Knowing Existence) is the stage associated with\nh a q i q a t-e-Muhammadi (Reality of Muhammad) or n u r-e - M u h a m-\nmadi (Light of Muhammad),* the stage of hahut in the Sphere of\nR e a l i t y. This is the stage of wahdiyat conscious of w a h i d i y a t\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 265\n* Haqiqat-e-Muhammadi: God’s original Word realized. \nNur-e-Muhammadi: God’s original Word expressed. \nH a q i q a t-e-Muhammadi includes n u r-e-Muhammadi, but n u r-e-Muhammadi does n o t\ninclude haqiqat-e-Muhammadi.\n(conscious Oneness conscious of Oneness-i n-manyness). It is\nthe second manifestation, the t a j a l l i-e-d o v v o m .\n3. M u m t a n-u l-wujud (Negative Existence) is the third stage of\nmanifestation ( t a j a l l i-e-sevvom). This is a l a m-e-j a b ru t(the men-\ntal sphere) at which point the stage of wahidiyat (Oneness in\nmanyness) begins.\n4. M u m k i n-u l-wujud (Possible Existence) amongst other things\ncomprises the world of angels and spirits, and is known as\nalam-e-malakut (the subtle sphere), which is the sphere of En-\ne rg y. This r e p resents t a j a l l i-e-c h a h a rom, the fourth stage of\nmanifestation.\n5 . Wa j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Existence) comprises ever y t h i n g\nrelating to gross existence. It is known to the Suﬁs as a l a m-e -\nnasut (the gross sphere), the ﬁfth aspect of manifestation, the\ntajalli-e-panjom.\nThese re p resent the ﬁve devolutions of God from the Beyond\nstate, known as t a j a l l i y a t-e-khamsa ( ﬁve manifestations) or k h a m s a\nwujudat (ﬁve existences).\nNow we shall treat each one of them in the ascending series be-\nginning with w a j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Existence) and ending\nwith wahid-ul-wujud (Unitary Existence).\nIn the domain of shariat ( l a w), w a j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Ex-\nistence) means to the theologian the Absolute God from Whom all\ngrades of existence derive their being. The Suﬁs on the other hand\nuse the term to denote everything that is gross and material. Here\nwujud means body , since the evolving soul in stone, vegetable, ani-\nmal and human form cannot be said to evolve without the gr o s s\nmediums composed of five elements. This gross existence in the\nstage of w a j i b-u l-wujud is a great boon conferred by God, as with-\nout it the achievement of the stages of Perfection, sainthood and\nleadership would be unthinkable.\nThe gross body is a wonderful and unique mechanism which\nhas in it all the other four relative and real existences, the subtle,\nmental and sub-supramental and God Himself. Hence the human\nbody is called by the Suﬁs as a l a m-e-saghir ( M i c rocosm) which is\n266 God Speaks Supplement\nthe epitome of alam-e-kabir (Macrocosm) which comprises all the\nﬁve existences, the mystery of which no one can unravel without\nthe help of the universal mind of a Perfect Master or the Saviour.\nWa j i b-u l-wujud ( N e c e s s a ry Existence, or gross sphere) derives\nits existence from or is the r e ﬂection of m u m k i n-u l-wujud ( s u b t l e\ns p h e re). The relationship between God and Creation at this stage\nis that of the lord and the slave. The evolving consciousness or mind\nof this stage is called nafs-e-ammara (evil self) and it has the natu-\nral tendency to enjoy anything that is gross. Here the idea of God’s\nrelation to man is known as tauhid-e-aqwali (verbal unity of God)\nwhich acknowledges the existence of God orally .\nM u m k i n-u l-wujud (Possible Existence, or subtle sphere) derives\nits existence from m u m t a n-u l-wujud (mental sphere). Herein the re-\nlationship between God and His manifested attributes is of the sort\nthat exists between father and children. Here God is kind, mer c i-\nful and vigilant towards His children who are car e f ree, with no\nthoughts of punishment or re w a rd, no desire for knowledge and no\ncraving for spiritual attainments. And such entities are commonly\nknown as angels. The consciousness of this sphere ( a l a m-e-m a l a k u t )\nis styled as nafs-e-lawaama (reproachful self) and the cognition of\nGod at this stage is called t a u h i d-e-a fa’ali (unity of action), which\nmeans the entities of this world are exclusively busy with their ap-\npointed task of remembering God.\nMumtan-ul-wujud (Negative Existence, or mental sphere) con-\ntains the fifth and sixth planes of the Path which at this stage\nreaches wahidiyat (Oneness in manyness). Wahidiyat begins fro m\nthe ﬁfth and reaches its zenith in the sixth plane and has explicit\nin it all the details of Creation comprising the subtle and the gross\nplanes. This is the a l a m-e-j a b rut which derives its existence fr o m\nand is the reflection of a r i f-u l-wujud (the stage of h a q i q a t-e-\nMuhammadi). It is called mumtan-ul-wujud, or Negative Existence,\nfor the simple reason that mumtana means that which is non-\nexistent, and wujud means the form or body of existence. Thus, the\nw o rd m u m t a n - u l-wujud signifies that the form is non-existent\ntherein. This stage is akin to the seed which contains within it the\npotential for the roots and the branches of the tree, which, when\n34  T auhid or the Unitary State of God 267\nfully evolved and manifest, go to re p resent the subtle and the gro s s\nplanes. The Suﬁs know this as la makan in which all ideas of time\nand space converge to a point.\nThe consciousness of the mental sphere is called by the Suﬁs\nn a f s-e-mutmainna, meaning beatified or satisfied self, in the fifth\nplane, and n a f s-e-mulhima, meaning inspired self, in the sixth plane.\nH e rein the relationship between God and Creation is that of Beloved\nand the lover, and the idea of God in these stages is known to the\nSuﬁs as tauhid-e-ahwali (unity of feeling). This is the stage known\nas h a q i q a t-e-insani (Reality of man) wherein man comes face to face\nwith God, but has not yet shed his ego and is still in the domain\nof duality .\nWa h i d-u l-wujud ( U n i t a ry Existence) in the stage of a l a m - e -\nlahut of the Sphere of Reality is the state in which God ﬁrst became\nconscious of His ahadiyat (conscious Oneness), and a r i f-u l-w u j u d\nin the stage of a l a m-e-hahut of the same sphere of Reality is the\nstate of w a h d i y a t-e-wahidiyat (conscious Oneness of Oneness- i n-\nmanyness) also called haqiqat-e-Muhammadi.\nIn the state of Wa r a-u l-Wara, God, according to the Suﬁs, was\na hidden tre a s u re and wanted to be known. No sooner did “the hid-\nden treasure” express a desire to know itself, than it became aware\nof itself as Light ( n u r), or n u r-e-Muhammadi, which has implicit\nand latent in it the existence of all the Creation and the manifest\nworld; and it is in relation to this that Prophet Muhammad has said,\n“God created my light ﬁrst, and from my light the universe came\ninto being.” This is the aspect of jamal (beauty) in the knowledge\nof God included in t a u h i d-e-zati (Unity of Essence). Here, the re-\nlationship existing between God and the Creation is that existing\nbetween the Lover and the beloved. Here the Lover is God and Mu-\nhammad is the beloved. God here possesses complete awareness of\nboth Himself and Creation.\nWa h i d-u l-wujud (Unity of Existence) is the first limitation of\nGod in the Beyond-Beyond state and is one of the stages of the\nfifth s p h e re known as lahut. This is the stage of conscious Abso-\nlutism which, when used by the a r i f-u l-wujud (Knowing Exis-\ntence), gives him the experience of both fana and baqa. This stage,\nlike all other stages of the Path, is beyond mind and intellect and\n268 God Speaks Supplement\ncannot be encompassed in words, and includes t a j a l l i-e - j a m a l i\n(epiphany of beauty) and t a j a l l i-e-jalali (epiphany of beatitude).\nTa j a l l i-e-jalali i sthat which confers on a soul the experience of\nfana (complete annihilation), and t a j a l l i-e-jamali endows him once\nagain with the consciousness of nor m a l i t y, known to the Suﬁs as\nbaqa ( p e rm a n e n c y). Ta j a l l i-e-jalali is also ashqiyyat w h e rein God\nis the Beloved and man is the lover; and t a j a l l i-e-jamali i sm a-\ns h u qiyat w h e rein God is the Lover and man is the beloved. This\nl a tter is the highest spiritual manifestation, known as faqr or f a q i r i .\nThus in a l a m-e-lahut and a l a m-e-hahut of the fifth, the Real\nS p h e re, are the stages of Perfection in the respective aspects of\nashiq-o-mashuq (Lover and the Beloved in One) and ashiq (Lover)\nand mashuq (Beloved) simultaneously. In a l a m-e-j a b rut ( m e n t a l\ns p h e re) are the stages of ashiq (lover) and arif ( g n o s t i c), in m a l a-\nkut (subtle sphere) is the stage of enumerator of attributes, and in\nnasut (the gross sphere) is the stage of waqif ( g ro s s-conscious one).\nDescribing these stages in the ascending or d e r, when waqif, t h e\nconscious one, becomes more conscious, he enters the stage of\nwasif (attributes). And from wasif he arrives at the stage of i rf a n\n(gnosis) and from i rfan he reaches the domain of the mysteries of\nGod ( m a a r if). F rom the stage of maarif he is presented with the\nsight of God which confers upon him the status of a lover, and\nwhen he ultimately becomes LOVE, he ﬁnds that he himself was the\nend-all and be-all of everything. In this stage of Huyat, everything\nis dissolved in the “I am God” state of God.\n35"

Truth can only\nbe known after one transcends the cosmic illusion which appears\nas real owing to Maya.\nMaya, the principle of ignorance, can only be transcended when\nthe spiritual aspirant is able to realize that Maya is God’s shadow\nand as such is nothing. The enigma of Maya solves itself only after\nSelf-realization.\n36 Meher Baba Says (190)\nSpiritual Paradox\n“Unless and until ignorance is removed and Knowledge is\ngained (the Knowledge whereby the divine life is experienced and\nlived) everything pertaining to the spiritual seems paradoxical—\nGod, whom we do not see, we say is real; and the world, which we\ndo see, we say is unreal. In experience, what exists for us does not\nreally exist; and what does not exist for us, really exists.\n“ We must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; thus loss\nitself is gain. We must die to self to live in God; thus death means\nlife. We must become completely void inside to be completely\npossessed by God; thus complete emptiness means absolute full-\nness. We must become naked of selfhood by being nothing, so\nas to be absorbed in the infinity of God; thus nothing means\nE v e ry t h i n g . ”\nExistence Is Substance and Life Is Shadow\n“Existence is eternal, whereas life is perishable.\n“Comparatively, Existence is what his body is to man, and life\nis as the cloth that covers the body . The same body changes clothes\na c c o rding to the seasons, time and circumstances, just as the one\nand eternal Existence is always there throughout the countless and\nvaried aspects of life.\n“ S h rouded beyond recognition by the cloak of life with its mul-\ntifarious folds and colours is Existence unchangeable. It is the g a r b\nof life with its veils of mind, energy and gross form sthat ‘shado w s ’\nand superimposes on Existence, presenting the eternal, indivisible\nand unchangeable Existence as transient, varied and ever- c h a n g i n g .\n270 God Speaks Supplement\n36  Meher Baba Says 271\n“Existence is all- p e rvading, and is the underlying essence of\nall things, whether animate or inanimate, real or unreal, varied in\nspecies or uniform in forms, collective or individual, abstract or\nsubstantial.\n“In the eternity of Existence there is no time. There is no past\nand no future; only the everlasting present. In eternity nothing has\never happened and nothing will ever happen. Everything is hap-\npening in the unending NOW .\n“Existence is God; whereas, life is illusion.\n“Existence is Reality; whereas, life is imagination.\n“Existence is everlasting; whereas, life is ephemeral.\n“Existence is unchangeable; whereas, life is ever-changing.\n“Existence is freedom; whereas, life is a binding.\n“Existence is indivisible; whereas, life is multiple.\n“Existence is imperceptible; whereas, life is deceptive.\n“Existence is independent; whereas, life is dependent upon\nmind, energy and gross forms.\n“Existence is; whereas, life appears to be.\n“Existence, therefore, is not life.\n“ B i rth and death do not mark the beginning or end of life.\nW h e reas the numerous stages and states of life which constitute\nthe so-called births and deaths are governed by the laws of evolu-\ntion and re i n c a rnation, life comes into being only once, with the\nadvent of the ﬁrst dim rays of limited consciousness, and succumbs\nto death only once on attaining the unlimited consciousness of in-\nﬁnite Existence.\n“Existence, all-knowing, all- p o w e rful, all-p resent God, is be-\nyond cause and effect, beyond time and space, beyond all actions.\n“Existence touches all, all things and all shadows. Nothing can\never touch Existence. Even the very fact of its being does not touch\nExistence.\n“ To realize Existence, life must be shed. It is life that endows\nl i m i t a t i o ns to the unlimited Self. Life of the limited self is sustained\nby the mind creating impressions; by energy supplying the impe-\ntus to accumulate and dissipate these impressions through expre s-\nsions; and by gross forms and bodies functioning as the i n s t ru m e n t s\n272 God Speaks Supplement\nt h rough which these impressions are spent, r e i n f o rced and even-\ntually exhausted, through actions.\n“Life is thickly linked with actions. Life is lived through actions.\nLife is valued through actions. Life’s survival depends on actions.\nLife cognizant is actions—actions opposite in nature, actions afﬁr-\nmative and negative, actions constructive and destructive.\n“Therefore, to let life succumb to its ultimate death is to let all\nactions end. When actions end completely , life of the limited self\nspontaneously experiences itself as Existence of the unlimited Self.\nExistence being realized, evolution and involution of conscious-\nness is complete, illusion vanishes, and the law of re i n c a rnation no\nlonger binds.\n“Simply to desist from committing actions will never put an\nend to actions. It would merely mean putting into action yet an-\nother action—that of inactivity .\n“ To escape from actions is not the remedy for the uprooting of\nactions. Rather, this would give scope to the limited self to get more\ninvolved in the very act of escaping, thus creating more actions.\nA ctions, both good and bad, are like knots in the tangled thr e a d\nof life. The more persistent the efforts to undo the knots of action,\nthe ﬁrmer become the knots and the greater the entanglement.\n“Only actions can nullify actions, in the same way that poison\ncan counteract the effects of poison. A deeply embedded thorn may\nbe extricated by the use of another thorn or any sharp object re-\nsembling it, such as a needle, used with skill and precaution. Simi-\nlarly, actions are totally uprooted by other actions—when they are\ncommitted by some activating agent other than the ‘self.’\n“ K a rma yoga, dnyan yoga, raj yoga and bhakti yoga s e rve the\npurpose of being prominent signposts on the path of Truth, di-\nrecting the seeker toward the goal of eternal Existence. But the hold\nof life, fed by actions, is so tight on the aspirant that even with the\nhelp of these inspiring signposts, he fails to be guided in the right\nd i rection. As long as the Self is bound by actions, the aspirant, or\neven the pilgrim on the path toward Truth, is sure to go astray\nthrough self-deception.\n“ T h roughout all ages, sadhus and seekers, sages and saints,\nmunis and monks, tapasavis and sanyasis, yogis, Sufis and t a l i b s\nhave struggled during their lifetimes, undergoing untold hard-\nships in their eff o rts to extricate themselves from the maze of ac-\ntions and to realize the eternal Existence by overcoming life.\n“They fail in their attempts because the more they str u g g l e\nwith their ‘selves,’ the firmer the selves become gripped by life,\nt h rough actions intensiﬁed by austerities and penances, by seclu-\nsions and pilgrimages, by meditation and concentration, by as-\ns e rtive utterances and silent contemplation, by intense activity and\ni n a c t i v i t y, by silence and verbosity , by japas and tapas, and by all\ntypes of yogas and chillas.\n“Emancipation from the grip of life and freedom from the lab-\nyrinths of actions are made possible for all and attained by a few ,\nwhen a Perfect Master, S a d g u ru or Qutub is approached and his\ngrace and guidance are invoked. The Perfect Master’s invariable\ncounsel is complete surrender to him. Those few who do surre n d e r\ntheir all—mind, body, possessions—so that with their complete\nsurrender they also surrender consciously their own ‘selves’ to the\nP e rfect Master, still have their very being left conscious to com-\nmit actions which are now activated only by the dictates of the\nMaster.\n“Such actions, after the surrender of one’s ‘self,’ are no longer\no n e ’s own actions. T h e re f o re, these actions are capable of upro o t-\ning all other actions which feed and sustain life. Life then becomes\ngradually lifeless and eventually succumbs, by the grace of the Per-\nfect Master, to its final death. Life, which once debarred the per-\nsevering aspirant from realizing perpetual Existence, can now no\nlonger work its own deception.\n“I have emphasized in the past, I tell you now , and I shall age\nafter age fore v e rm o re repeat that you shed your cloak of life and\nrealize Existence which is eternally yours.\n“ To realize this truth of unchangeable, indivisible, all-p e rv a d i n g\nExistence, the simplest way is to surrender to me completely; so\ncompletely that you are not even conscious of your surre n d e r, con-\nscious only to obey me and to act as and when I order you.\n“If you seek to live perpetually , then crave for the death of your\ndeceptive self at the hands of complete surrender to me. This yoga\nis the essence of all yogas in one.”\n36  Meher Baba Says 273\nThe Four Journeys\n“God is inﬁnite and His shadow is also inﬁnite. The shadow of\nGod is the inﬁnite space that accommodates the inﬁnite gross sphere\nwhich, with its occurrences of millions of universes, within and\nwithout the range of men’s knowledge, is the Creation that issued\nf rom the point of ﬁniteness in the inﬁnite Existence that is God.\n“In these millions of universes are many systems with planets.\nSome are in gaseous states, some in states of solidiﬁcation, some\nof stone and metal, some which also have vegetation. Some have also\ndeveloped life forms such as worms, some also ﬁsh, some also b i rd s ,\nsome also animals, and a few also have human beings.\n“Thus it is that throughout the myriads of universes there are\nplanets on which the seven kingdoms of evolution are manifested,\nand the evolution of consciousness and forms is completed.\n“But only on the planet Earth do human beings re i n c a rnate and\nbegin the involutionary path to Self-realization. \n“ E a rth is the centre of this inﬁnite gross sphere of millions of\nuniverses inasmuch as it is the Point to which all human-c o n s c i o u s\nsouls must migrate in order to begin the involutionary path.\n“This involutionary path has seven stations and arrival at the\nseventh station completes the ﬁrst journey to God.\n“Although the completion of this journey is the Goal of all hu-\nman souls, only a very few at any given moment embark upon it.\nThe arrival at the end of this journey is the drowning of individ-\nuality in the Ocean of infinite consciousness, and the jour n e y ’s\ncompletion is the soul’s absorption in the state of ‘I am God’ with\nfull consciousness, and, as God, it experiences infinite Power,\nKnowledge and Bliss.\n“Out of all the souls who complete the ﬁrst journ e y, a very few\nenter the second journey. This journey has no stations. It is an in-\nstantaneous journey—the journey of inﬁnite consciousness being\nshaken from its absorption in ‘I am God’ to abiding in God as God.\nIn this state individuality is regained, but individuality is now in-\nfinite, and this inﬁnity includes gross consciousness, and so as man\nand God it experiences inﬁnite Power, Knowledge and Bliss in t h e\n274 God Speaks Supplement\nmidst of most-ﬁniteness—the unlimited Soul knows Its unlimit-\nedness in the midst of limitation.\n“The third journey is undertaken only by those who have ac-\ncomplished the second journ e y, and whose lot it is to bear the bur-\nden of the exercise of inﬁnite Power, Knowledge and Bliss and so\nlive God’s life both as man and God simultaneously .\n“ T h e re are only five such masters living on the earth at any\ngiven moment, and they control the movement of the universes\nand the affairs of the worlds of men. Only when one of these ﬁ v e\nP e rfect Masters drops his body can one of those who are abiding in\nGod as God move onwards and complete the third journey to ﬁ l l\nthe vacant ofﬁce.\n“It is the duty of these five Perfect Masters to precipitate the\na dvent of the Ancient One ( Av a t a r )and to hand over to Him the\ncharge of His own Creation.\n“All those who live God’s life on earth and all those who abide\nin God as God on earth, when they drop their bodies, also shed\nf o rever their subtle and mental vehicles and pass away utterly as\nGod, retaining infinite individuality and experiencing infinite\nP o w e r, Knowledge and Bliss. This is the fourth jour n e y.\n“In reality these four journeys are never journeyed, for God\nhas nowhere to journ e y. He is without beginning and without end.\nAnd everything, which has the appearance of being, appeared fro m\nThat which has no beginning and passes back into That which h a s\nno ending.”\n37"

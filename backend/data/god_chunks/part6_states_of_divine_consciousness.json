    "text": "After taking human form and gaining full consciousness, the atma still does not experience Paramatma as long as consciousness remains centred in gross impressions. Human form is necessary for gaining subtle, mental and Self-consciousness, but gross sanskaras do not disappear immediately after full consciousness is attained. Hence the atma continues to reincarnate until gross impressions fade into subtle, then mental impressions, and finally disappear."

    "section": "Involution of Consciousness",
    "text": "In human form, gross impressions gradually transform into subtle impressions, subtle into mental impressions, and mental impressions finally disappear. The atma first loses consciousness of the gross body and gains subtle consciousness, then loses subtle consciousness and gains mental consciousness, and finally loses mental consciousness to gain Self-consciousness and experience Paramatma."

    "section": "Three States of Divine Consciousness",
    "text": "After Self-realization, the atma inherits one of three definite states. First State A: the atma drops all gross, subtle and mental bodies and eternally enjoys individualized infinite bliss without using divine attributes. First State B: the atma retains the bodies for some time but remains unconscious of them, its state being identical with A. Second State: the atma retains all three bodies and is conscious of them while simultaneously experiencing infinite power, knowledge and bliss, but does not use these attributes for others. Third State: the atma is like the second state but actively uses infinite power, knowledge and bliss to raise other souls from gross to subtle, subtle to mental, and mental to Self-consciousness."

    "section": "Functioning of Gross, Subtle and Mental Bodies",
    "text": "Only in human form are subtle and mental bodies fully developed. A gross-conscious soul works unconsciously through subtle and mental bodies; a subtle-conscious soul works unconsciously through gross and mental bodies; and a mental-conscious soul works unconsciously through gross and subtle bodies. Each state uses lower bodies indirectly according to its level of consciousness."

    "section": "Simile of Scientist and Fourth Plane Danger",
    "text": "The subtle-conscious soul of the fourth plane, possessing tremendous energy yet unconscious of Mind, faces grave danger. Misuse of power under the influence of overpowering desires can cause a catastrophic fall to stone-consciousness. This is likened to a scientist who, driven by desire, misuses destructive energy and suffers total collapse of consciousness. Perfect Masters guard souls at this stage to prevent such downfall."

    "text": "Mental-conscious souls of the fifth and sixth planes master Mind but are unconscious of Energy and therefore cannot perform miracles. They control thoughts and feelings of others but cannot fall back. The Self-conscious soul of the seventh plane transcends Mind and Energy entirely, eternally experiencing and sometimes using infinite power, knowledge and bliss for the emancipation of other souls."

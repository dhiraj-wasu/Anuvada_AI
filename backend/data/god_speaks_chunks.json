A number of cycles of births and deaths in the human form have to contribute towards that ripeness of gross experience, which ultimately propels the consciousness of the soul onto the path of liberating involution, on which impressions become fainter and fainter and eventually disappear.

The reason for this is that the ﬁrst human-form made out of the last animal-form, when dropped, leaves behind a legacy of impressions of the ﬁrst human- f o rm, and then each following incarnated human-form is made up of the last human-form sanskaras.

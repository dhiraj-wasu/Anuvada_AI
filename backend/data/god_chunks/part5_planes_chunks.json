  "section": "Introduction – Involution of Liberating Consciousness",
  "text": "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world, it enters the spiritual path and turns inwards. Its gross impressions become less deep and gradually transform into subtle and then mental impressions, until consciousness is freed to reflect the Truth. This involution of consciousness is usually gradual and marks the soul’s homeward journey. The soul snaps its link first with the gross world, then with the subtle world, and lastly with the mental world, crossing six planes in this inward journey, while the soul itself ever abides in the Over-Soul beyond all planes."

  "chapter":"The Planes",
  "section": "First Plane",
  "text": "As gross consciousness involves, the soul partially experiences the first plane of the subtle world. At this stage, subtle impressions are perceived partially through gross senses and partially through subtle senses. The soul stands on the line of demarcation between the gross and subtle worlds, seeing subtle visions, hearing celestial sounds, and sensing subtle fragrances, while still functioning in the gross world."

  "section": "Second Plane",
  "text": "With further involution, the soul becomes fully subtle-conscious and experiences the second plane of the subtle world, the domain of infinite energy. Though unconscious of the gross and mental bodies, the soul continues to function outwardly as an ordinary human being. Here the soul gains access to subtle powers and may perform minor miracles, experiencing the subtle world through subtle senses while remaining entirely detached from the gross world."

  "book": "God Speaks",
  "chapter":"The Planes",
  "section": "Third Plane",
  "text": "On the third plane the soul gains greater subtle consciousness and greater finite power. It may perform major miracles such as restoring sight or limbs and can traverse the subtle worlds freely. The second and third planes belong wholly to the subtle world, while the first plane is partially gross and the fourth is a threshold between subtle and mental."

  "id": "gs_part5_plane_4",
  "book": "God Speaks",
  "chapter":"The Planes",
  "section": "Fourth Plane",
  "text": "The fourth plane is the threshold of the mental world. Here the soul is fully conscious of infinite energy and possesses tremendous divine power. However, intense desires and emotions create grave danger. Misuse of power can cause a catastrophic fall back to stone-consciousness, while right use or complete non-use allows safe passage to higher planes. The fourth plane is the most perilous stage of the spiritual journey."

  "book": "God Speaks",
  "chapter":"The Planes",
  "section": "Fifth Plane",
  "text": "On the fifth plane the soul enters the mental world and identifies with the first state of Mind—thought. The soul becomes the creator and controller of thoughts but has no mastery over feelings or desires. Miraculous powers cease, and the soul gains stability, incapable of falling back to lower planes."

  "id": "gs_part5_plane_6",
  "book": "God Speaks",
  "chapter":"The Planes",
  "section": "Sixth Plane",
  "text": "The sixth plane is the state of full consciousness of feeling. The soul continuously ‘sees’ God face to face and experiences intense divine love and longing for union. Thought is completely absent, and mastery exists only over feelings. Though almost impressionless, the soul still experiences duality by identifying as Mind and not yet as God."

{
  "id": "gs_part5_plane_7",
  "book": "God Speaks",
  "chapter":"The Planes",
  "section": "Seventh Plane",
  "text": "On the seventh plane the soul dissociates from mind and realizes itself as the Self—God. Infinite knowledge, power and bliss are experienced consciously. This realization occurs only through the grace of a Perfect Master. Here illusion vanishes completely, the mind is annihilated, and the soul fulfills the initial urge for Self-knowledge by realizing its eternal unity with the Over-Soul."

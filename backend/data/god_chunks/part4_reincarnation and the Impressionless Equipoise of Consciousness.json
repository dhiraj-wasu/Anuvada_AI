    "text": "DURING the course of evolution of its consciousness, the soul (atma), while consciously identifying itself with varied, finite gross forms, was also simultaneously, though unconsciously, identifying itself with its finite subtle form and its finite mental form, which associated with the soul in compact, homogeneous, unconscious alliance throughout the entire course of evolution of consciousness right from the first urge. From the unconscious state of the soul (comparable to the deep-sleep state of man), until it has gained full gross consciousness (comparable to the wide-open eyes of man in the awake state) while experiencing the gross world, the soul is One—indivisible, infinite, formless—and is eternally in the Over-Soul.\n\nThroughout the whole process of evolution, reincarnation was an absolutely spontaneous outcome of the first urge, manifested in the unconscious soul, to become conscious of its eternal and infinite Self. As has been mentioned already, we can now understand that the cycle of evolution of consciousness of soul evolved further and greater consciousness, together with the evolution of forms of higher and higher types, while exhausting the impressions of the dissociated forms of lower types.\n\nThus the evolution of consciousness of soul apparently causes the soul to identify itself with, and gather varied innumerable impressions of, higher and higher gross species of forms of the gross world. The clean-cut and major concrete gross forms (after the most-first seven major, most abstract gaseous and fluid forms) with which the consciousness of the soul associated are separated by the seven leaps from stone to metal, from metal to vegetable, from vegetable to worm, from worm to fish, from fish to bird, from bird to animal and lastly from animal to human being.\n\nThe most-finite first impression of the first urge gave to the unconscious soul the most-finite first consciousness. Gradually, varied impressions gained greater finite consciousness for the soul, and eventually the evolution of consciousness was complete when the soul identified itself with the first human-form. In human-form the soul achieves full and complete consciousness. Therefore the soul, having now gained full and complete consciousness in human-form, does not need any more or any other higher forms to evolve consciousness.\n\nThough the soul has gained full and complete consciousness, it is still not conscious of its Self as One, indivisible, eternal and infinite, and does not experience infinite knowledge, power and bliss. It is fully conscious only of its identity with the human-form and experiences the gross world in full. Because of the burden of gross impressions of the human-form, the consciousness of the soul dissociates from that form at death, but the impressions cling to consciousness.\n\nIn trying to unburden itself of these impressions, the soul undergoes innumerable reincarnations, experiencing opposite impressions through varied human-forms. The attempt to balance impressions is constantly disturbed by fresh associations with new human-forms. Thus equilibrium is approached but missed. Heaven and hell are states in which predominant impressions are experienced subjectively in the absence of the gross body, yet even here complete impressionless equipoise is not attained.\n\nResidual impressions compel further association with gross forms, sustaining an unending chain of births and deaths until consciousness succeeds in establishing complete impressionless equipoise. Through countless reincarnations, impressions are experienced, counterbalanced and thinned out, leading ultimately to emancipation from ignorance and realization of Self-consciousness.\n\nThroughout reincarnation the soul never dissociates from its subtle and mental bodies. These bodies evolve simultaneously with gross evolution, fortifying consciousness with energy and retaining impressions. In lower forms instinct gradually develops, and in the human-form instinct transforms into intellect. Thus only in the human-form are gross, subtle and mental bodies fully developed.\n\nAlthough the gross-conscious human soul experiences only the gross world, it indirectly uses the subtle and mental bodies. After death, impressions retained in subtle and mental bodies lead the soul through heaven or hell before rebirth. Birth is the association of the soul with a new human-form moulded from residual impressions.\n\nThus the reincarnation process is the continuous play of association and dissociation of consciousness with gross forms, sustained by impressions, until consciousness ultimately attains impressionless equipoise and realizes the infinite, eternal state of the Self."

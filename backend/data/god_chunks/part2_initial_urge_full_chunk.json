Ed.]\n\nNow was this ﬁrst urge inﬁnite or ﬁnite, and was it at ﬁrst ﬁn i t e\nand then inﬁnite or vice versa?\nThe ﬁrst urge was most ﬁnite, but this ﬁrst urge was of the Inﬁn i t e .\nThis most ﬁnite ﬁrst urge was of the inﬁnite Ocean-P a r a m a t m a ,\nand the manifestation of this latent most ﬁnite ﬁrst urge of the In-\nf i n i t e w a sre s t r i c t e d t oa m o s t f i n i t e p o i n t i n t h e i n f i n i t e , u n l i m-\ni t e d O c e a n .\nBut as this most ﬁnite point of manifestation of the latent ﬁrst\nu rge, which was most ﬁnite too, was in the inﬁnite, unlimited Ocean,\nt h i s m o s t f i n i t e p o i n t o f m a n i f e s t a t i o n o f t h e f i r s tu rg ew a s a l s o\nu nlimited.\nT h rough this most ﬁnite point of manifestation of the ﬁrst urg e\n(also most ﬁn i t e), the shadow of the Inﬁnite (which shadow , when\nof Reality , is inﬁnite) gradually appeared* and went on expanding.\nThis most ﬁnite point of manifestation of the latent ﬁrst urge is\ncalled the “Om” Point or C reation Point and this point is unlimited.\nSimultaneously with reverberations of the ﬁrst urge, the most\ng ross ﬁrst impression emerged, objectifying the soul as the most ab-\nsolute opposite and most ﬁnite gross counterpart of the Inﬁnite.\nBecause of this most gross ﬁrst impression of the ﬁrst urge, the in-\nﬁnite Soul experienced for the ﬁrst time. This ﬁrst experience of the\ninﬁnite Soul was that it (the Soul) experienced a contrariety in its\nidentity with its inﬁnite, impressionless, unconscious state.\nThis experience of contrariety effected changeableness in the\ne t e rnal, indivisible stability of the inﬁnite Soul, and spontaneously\nt h e re occurred a sort of eruption, disrupting the indivisible poise\nand the unconscious tranquility of the inﬁnite Soul with a recoil or\nt remendous shock which impregnated the unconsciousness of the\nunconscious Soul with first consciousness of its apparent sepa-\nrateness from the indivisible state of Paramatma. But the Soul\nbeing i n ﬁnite, the ﬁrst consciousness that it derived from the r e -\ncoil or shock of an absolutely opposite and most gross first im-\np ression of its apparent separateness was naturally and necessarily\nﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness.\nInitial Urge 9\n* The sense to be conveyed is that the shadow of the Inﬁnite seeped through or oozed\nout of the most ﬁnite point.\n\nThis ﬁrst consciousness derived by the Soul is obviously most,\nm o s t - ﬁnite in pro p o rtion to the experience of the absolute oppo-\nsites of its own original inﬁnite state.\nIt then means that in the beginning, when the impr e s s i o n l e s s\ninfinite Soul was first impressioned, it got as its first impression an\nabsolutely gross impression. And the first consciousness it (the\nSoul) derived was most, most-ﬁnite.\nSimultaneously at that instant, the unconsciousness of the inﬁ-\nnite Soul actually experienced most, most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness\nof the most-gross ﬁrst impre s s i o n .\nThis inﬁnite and eternal Soul did get consciousness, but this con-\nsciousness by impression was not of its e t e rnal state or its inﬁn i t e\nSelf but was of the most-ﬁnite, by the most-gross impre s s i o n .\nNow as will be explained later, if the soul is conscious of im-\np ressions (sanskaras) then the soul must necessarily experience\nt h e s ei m p re s s i o n s ,a n d i no rd e rt o e x p e r i e n c e t h e i m p re s s i o n s ,\nthe consciousness of the soul must experience them through pro -\nper media.\nAs the impressions are, so are the experiences of impr e s s i o n s\nand so must be the media to experience the impressions. That is, the\ni m p ressions give rise to experiences, and to experience the impre s-\nsions the use of appropriate media is necessitated.\nT h e re f o re as the inﬁnite, eternal and formless Soul now has the\nmost, most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness of the most, most-gross ﬁrst im-\np ression, quite obviously and necessarily this most, most-ﬁnite ﬁr s t\nconsciousness of the soul must utilize the most, most-ﬁnite and\nmost, most-gross ﬁrst medium to experience the most, most-gro s s\nﬁrst impre s s i o n .\nAt this stage it sufﬁces to mention here for the limited human\nunderstanding that the most, most-ﬁnite ﬁrst consciousness of the\nsoul, while experiencing the most, m o s t - g ross first impr e s s i o n ,\ncent red itself in an appropriate most, most-ﬁnite and most, most-\ng ross medium, imperceptibly tending the Soul (without form) to as-\nsociate and identify its very inﬁnite, eternal Self with this most,\nm o s t - g ross and most, most-ﬁnite limited form as its ﬁrst medium.\nThe ﬁrst consciousness of the indivisible Soul, experiencing the\nﬁrst impression through the ﬁrst medium, creates a tendency in the\n10 God Speaks\n\nsoul to associate and identify its eternal, inﬁnite Self with the ﬁrst\nform, the most-ﬁnite and most-gross, which was as the seed of the\nc o n t r a r i e t y, spontaneously sown by the reverberations of the ﬁ r s t\nu rge, imperceptibly germinated and manifested, for the ﬁrst time,\nin the shape of duality . When it is made to associate and identify it-\nself, by its newly gained consciousness, with the ﬁnite, gross form\nor medium, the consciousness of the soul actually makes the in-\nﬁnite, eternal, indivisible Soul without form experience that it is\nthat ﬁnite, gross form.\nThus the consciousness gained by the unconscious soul, in-\nstead of experiencing reality t h rough unity and identity with the\nOver-Soul, experiences illusion through duality and identity with\nthe gross form, multiplying diverse, innumerable impressions in\na series of experiences while associating with the gross form and\ngradually gaining or evolving more and more consciousness.\nIn order to understand more clearly and concretely how the\nconsciousness gained by the soul gradually develops through the\np rocess of evolution, let us examine that state of the conscious soul\nw h e re the consciousness of the soul associates itself with stone-\nform as the most-ﬁnite and most-gross medium, and the soul thus\nbegins to identify itself as stone. \nActually the consciousness of the soul utilizes the stone-form\nonly after innumerable cycles and ages of diverse experiences\nt h rough diverse species of forms, of which there are seven major\nd i ff e rent kinds of most, most-ﬁnite and most, most-gross gaseous\nf o rms, which cannot even be concretely grasped nor imagined by\nordinary human beings.\nIt is for convenience that we begin with that state of conscious\ns o u l w h e n i t j u s t b e g i n s t o a s s o c i a t e a n d i d e n t i f y i t s e l f w i t h\ns t o n e -form.\nIn stone-form, too, there are varied species, and the con-\nsciousness of the soul has to utilize each and all of these species\nas appropriate media, one after the other, in accordance with the\ndiversity of impressions of the soul, to experience varied and\ncountless impressions gathered one after the other in stone-form.\nIf we take stone as a medium for most-gross impressions, it fol-\nlows that the soul, which is eternally in the Over-Soul, now with\nInitial Urge 11\n\nmost-finite consciousness experiences most-gross impr e s s i o n s\nthrough the medium of stone-form.\nIt is thus that the infinite, indivisible, eternal soul (without\nf o rm) which is eternally in the Over-Soul, while experiencing the\nmost-finite gross impressions through its own most-finite con-\nsciousness, utilizes the most-ﬁnite gross medium of the ﬁrst-most\nspecies of stone (“ﬁrst-most” meaning the very, very ﬁrst), and the\nsoul is thus imperc e p t i b l y, though spontaneously , made to identify\nitself as stone.\nAfter ages and cycles the most-finite gross consciousness is\ngradually much more evolved in the soul by innumerable and var-\nied experiences of the most-gross finite impressions through the\ni d e n t i ﬁcation of the soul with the ﬁrst-most species of stone. Even-\nt u a l l y, when a limit to having experiences is reached, the identi-\nﬁcation of the soul with the ﬁrst-most species of stone is gradually\ndissociated and that stone-form is dropped.\nThe soul remains now for a period without any medium, though\nthe most-ﬁnite consciousness which has been evolved remains to-\ngether with the most-gross finite impressions of the most-first\nspecies of stone-form just shed. \nThus the soul, now without any medium or form, is conscious\nof the most-ﬁnite impressions (sanskaras). But as long as conscious-\nness is centred in impressions, the soul must necessarily experience\nthose impressions.\nTherefore, in order to experience the impressions of the most-\nﬁrst species of stone-form dropped, the consciousness of the soul\nc e n t red in the impressions of the dropped stone-form begins to as-\nsociate with the most-next species of stone-form. The soul identiﬁe s\nitself with this species of stone, and the consciousness of the soul be-\ngins to experience, through association with the new medium of the\nmost-next species of stone-form, the impressions of the most-ﬁr s t\nspecies of stone-form .\nThe most important point to be understood here is that when\nthe consciousness of the soul dissociates its identification fr o m\none form or medium and retains only the impressions of the form\nso dissociated, these impressions are experienced through another\n12 God Speaks\n\na pp ropriate medium when the consciousness of the soul associates\nwith the next medium or form. But this next medium or form is al-\nways created and moulded of the consolidated impressions of the\nlast species of form with which the soul associated and identiﬁ e d\nitself and which (impressions) were retained by the consciousness\nof the soul even when dissociated from the form.\nThus, innumerable diverse experiences of countless impr e s-\nsions experienced by the consciousness of the soul through diverse\nspecies of stone-forms, one after the other, lead to the greater evo-\nlution of consciousness of the soul.\nUltimately a stage is reached after ages and cycles of experiences\nw h e re the consciousness of the soul has a tendency to dissociate\nthe soul even from the most-last species of stone-form; and, although\nthe most-last species of stone-form is dissociated or dropped by the\nsoul, the most-ﬁnite consciousness evolved thus far remains together\nwith the most-ﬁnite gross impressions of the most-last species of\ns t o n e - f o rm dro p p e d .\nThe soul, now without any medium or form, is conscious of the\nm o s t - ﬁnite gross impressions (sanskaras) of the most-last species of\ns t o n e - f o rm. The soul must necessarily experience these impre s s i o n s .\nN o w, in order to experience the impressions of the most-last\ns t o n e - f o rm, the soul associates and identiﬁes with another medium—\nthe metal-form. This medium of metal-form is but the mould of the\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of stone-form. In other word s ,\nthe most-ﬁrst species of metal-form is created and moulded of the\nmost-last species of stone-form impressions.\nIt is thus that the inﬁnite, eternal soul without form, which is\ne t e rnally in the Over-Soul, experiences through evolved conscious-\nness the most-gross ﬁnite impressions of the most-last species of\ns t o n e - f o rm while associating and identifying itself with the most-\nﬁrst species of metal-form.\nT h e re are diverse species of metal-form just as there are of stone-\nf o rm, and the consciousness of the soul utilizes these diverse innu-\nmerable species of metal-form as media through which to experience\nthe diverse and innumerable impressions gathere d. Thus the evo-\nlution of the consciousness of the soul gains and gathers momentum\nInitial Urge 13\n\nin pro p o rtion to the diverse and multiple experiences of varied\nand innumerable impressions, through diff e rent media or species\nof forms.\nThis is how the cycles of evolution of consciousness of the soul\ngo on evolving further and greater consciousness with evolution of\nf o rms of higher and higher species, while experiencing and ex-\nhausting the impressions of the dissociated forms of the lower and\nlower species.\nThe consciousness of the soul experiences and exhausts all the\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of stone-form through the\nmedium of the most-ﬁrst species of metal-form. When all the im-\np ressions of the most-last species of stone-form are exhausted, the\nconsciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-ﬁrst species\nof metal-form, and drops that form. But the consciousness now re-\ntains the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of the metal-form .*\nThese impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of the metal-form\na re now experienced by the conscious soul through its associa-\ntion and identiﬁcation with the most-next species of metal-for m .\nThis form is but the consolidated mould of the impressions of the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of metal-form which was dropped or dissociated\nby the conscious soul. A chain of varied species of metal-forms is\nthus created and the soul (or to be more precise, the consciousness\nof the soul) associates with and dissociates from every species\nof the metal-form, exhausting and gaining diverse impr e s s i o n s .\nWhile experiencing these impressions, the soul evolves more and\nm o re consciousness simultaneously with the evolution of the\nhigher and higher species of forms. After ages and cycles, at last the\nconsciousness of the soul associates and identiﬁes itself with the\nmost-last species of metal-form to experience the impressions of\nthe most-last but one species of metal-form that the soul has just\ndropped or dissociated.\n14 God Speaks\n* [The reader should not think the oft-appearing “mosts,” such as most-ﬁrst, most-\nnext, most-ﬁnite, are superﬂuous or redundant, because each species of a cer t a i n\nf o rm—stone, for instance—has numerous repetitions with slight variations be-\nfore going on to the most-next species of that same form, and it seemed necessary\nto diff e rentiate. “Most-last” is used to mean the form most recently encounter e d ,\ni . e . ,the highest and latest evolutionary form of the species, and should not be con-\nstrued as the form furthest down the scale. Ed.]\n\nThis soul, eternally in the Over-Soul, though being inﬁnite and\nwithout form, ﬁnds itself as metal.\nWhile identifying itself with diverse species of metal-form\nthe soul begins to experience simultaneously the gross world in\na c c o rdance with and in pr o p o rtion to the soul’s experiences of\nthe stone-form and the metal-for m .\nThe metal-form, which includes a series of diverse species of\nmetal, is as inorganic, inanimate and solid as the stone-form, which\nincludes a series of diverse species of stone.\nThe soul, or more pr e c i s e l y, the consciousness of the soul,\nwhile identifying itself with the species of stone- and metal-forms,\nﬁnds itself as one with the stone- or metal-form and thus r e a l i z e s\nitself as inorganic, inanimate and solid, and experiences these in-\no rganic, inanimate and solid states throughout the entire evolution\nof the stone- and metal-forms in the gross world.\nThe solid, inanimate state of the soul is one in which life and\nenergy are still dormant in spite of greater evolution of conscious-\nness. Hence the forms in this solid state cannot of their own accord\nmove about by themselves ( i.e., they cannot have voluntary mo-\ntion), and there f o re the consciousness of the soul, associating with\nthese solid forms which are inanimate and inorganic and with life\nand energy still dormant in them, tends to assert recumbent, hori-\nzontal positions rather than to assert vertical, upright stands or\nerect positions in the gross world.\nAfter ages and cycles of varied innumerable gross experiences\no f diverse and innumerable impressions through a variety of\nspecies of metal-forms, the consciousness of the soul eventually\ndissociates itself even from the most-last species of metal-for m .\nThus the identity of the soul with the most-last species of metal-\nf o rm is dropped and as usual the conscious soul now is once again\ntemporarily unidentiﬁed with any form (i.e., the soul is now with-\nout any form).\nIn this state of the conscious soul, when there is no form with\nwhich to be associated, the consciousness of the soul is centr e d\nonly in the impressions of the most-last species of metal-for m ,\nwhich has now been dropped.\nInitial Urge 15\n\nThus the conscious soul in this state—of having no form for\ni d e n t i ﬁcation—is conscious only of the impressions of the most-\nlast species of metal-form.\nThe conscious soul must exhaust these impressions of the\nmost-last species of the metal-form by the consciousness of the\nsoul experiencing these impressions through some appr o p r i a t e\nmedium. And the appropriate medium to spend or exhaust these\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of metal-form is the most-ﬁr s t\nspecies of vegetable-form. This species of vegetable-form is noth-\ning but the consolidated mould of the impressions of the most-last\nspecies of the metal-form.\nWhen the consciousness of the soul associates now with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of vegetable-form, the soul, thus conscious, tends\nto identify itself with that form and actually finds itself as that\nspecies of vegetable-form, quite oblivious of the reality that it\n(soul) is inﬁnite, eternal and without form—eternally in the Over-\nSoul (Paramatma). \nIn this state of the most-ﬁrst species of the vegetable-form the\nconsciousness of the soul experiences the gross world, in accor-\ndance with and in pro p o rtion to the impressions it experienced and\nexperiences of the stone-forms, metal-forms and vegetable-form\nrespectively .\nWhile thus experiencing the gross world, this consciousness of\nthe soul, identified with the vegetable-form, realizes now that it\nis vegetable and has half inanimate and half animate attributes.\nThe conscious soul now asserts in the gross world through this\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm an upright, erect stand. Although this form can-\nnot stand independently by itself, it uses the support of other\nmedia to assert an upright stand. This form is still not capable,\nh o w e v e r, of giving the experience of voluntary movement to the\nconsciousness of the soul.\nAfter the impressions of the last-most species of the metal-form\na re exhausted by the consciousness of the soul through the most-\nﬁrst species of vegetable-form, this most-ﬁrst species of vegetable-\nf o rm is dropped (i . e . ,the consciousness of the soul dissociates itself\nfrom this most-ﬁrst species of vegetable-form).\n16 God Speaks\n\nAgain the conscious soul realizes that it is without a form al-\nthough the evolved consciousness is there. This evolved con-\nsciousness of the soul is now centred in the impressions of the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of the vegetable-form just dropped or dissociated.\nTo experience these impressions of the most-first species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm, the consciousness of the soul, now without any\nf o rm, utilizes an appropriate medium, which is the most-next\nspecies of the vegetable-form. This most-next species of the\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm is nothing but the consolidated mould of the im-\npressions of the most-ﬁrst species of vegetable-form.\nBy association with the medium of the most-next species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm, the consciousness of the soul experiences in the\ng ross world the impressions of that last species of the vegetable-\nf o rm just dropped. When these impressions are exhausted thro u g h\ndiverse experiences, the consciousness of the soul relinquishes its\na ssociation with the most-next species of vegetable-form and again\nexperiences that it (the soul) is without gross form and that its con-\nsciousness is centred only in the impressions of that species of form\nlast dropped. Again, to experience these impressions the conscious-\nness of the soul tends the soul to identify with the next species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm. This chain of impressions, experiences and species\nof form, from one form to another, is so linked that it is appare n t l y\nendless; and the consciousness of the soul, in order to evolve it-\nself fully and completely , has no other course but to become en-\ntangled in this vicious circle until, per f o rce, the consciousness of\nthe soul thus gained, makes the soul realize that it is inﬁnite, eter-\nnal and eternally in the Over-Soul, and makes the soul experience\ninﬁnite power, knowledge and bliss.\nThe point that is important and which is to be carefully noted\nis that, as the cycle of evolution of consciousness of the soul ro l l s\non and on, and further and greater consciousness is evolved thro u g h\nexperiences of further and greater impressions, this evolution of\nconsciousness inadvertently evolves a series of forms of higher and\nhigher species while exhausting the impressions of the lower and\nlower species that get dissociated or dropped or shed.\nThus the gap between the beginning and the end of a series of\nspecies of one particular form, such as stone-form or metal-form or\nInitial Urge 17\n\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm or other forms, beginning with the lowest or cru d e\nmost-ﬁrst species of a form of particular kind and ending with the\nhighest or sublime most-last species of form of that particular kind,\nis pro g ressively filled in by the evolution of forms of higher and\nhigher types suitable to the impressions and aiding the conscious-\nness of the soul to gain higher and higher consciousness. In short,\nin between the most-ﬁrst and most-last species of form of a par-\nticular form, there are diverse species of forms of that par t i c u l a r\nf o rm, evolved to suit the re q u i rements of the evolving conscious-\nness of the soul.\nComing to the point, when the consciousness of the soul as-\nsociates itself with the most-last species of vegetable-form, the\nc o nscious soul identiﬁes itself with this most-last species of vegetable-\nf o rm and experiences the impressions of the most-last but one\nspecies of the vegetable-form that was last shed.\nWhen all the impressions of this most-last but one species of\nv e g e t a b l e - f o rm are exhausted, the conscious soul no longer iden-\nt i ﬁes itself with the most-last species of vegetable-form because the\nconsciousness of the soul has dissociated itself from that most-last\nspecies of vegetable-form. This most-last species of vegetable-form\nis also eventually shed by the conscious soul after ages and cycles\nof experience of the whole vegetable kingdom through the gr o s s\nworld, on the earth and in the waters.\nAlthough the most-last species of vegetable-form is shed by the\nconscious soul and the soul is now without any form, yet the con-\nsciousness evolved is there, and through this consciousness the\nsoul (though without form) is conscious of the impressions of the\nmost-last species of the vegetable-form just shed.\nThese impressions must necessarily be spent or exhausted.\nIn order to experience these impressions the consciousness of\nthe soul now associates with an appropriate medium to experience\nthese impressions of the most-last species of the vegetable-for m .\nT h e re f o re, the consciousness of the soul thus tends the soul to\nidentify itself with the most-ﬁrst species of the worm - f o rm. It must\nbe re m e m b e red that this form of the most-first species of wor m -\nform is nothing other than the consolidated mould of the impres-\nsions of the most-last species of vegetable-form.\n18 God Speaks\n\nWhile the conscious soul thus identiﬁes itself with this most-\nfirst species of wor m - f o rm, the soul realizes that it is actually a\nworm and becomes worm-conscious.\nDespite all of the consciousness so far evolved, the soul is still\nnot conscious of its reality, its original, inﬁnite, eternal state, eter-\nnally in the Over-Soul. Although the soul is eternally in the Over-\nSoul and is inﬁnite and without form, this partially conscious soul\nactually experiences itself as a worm in the gross world. This is\nignorance. This ignorance persists as long as the consciousness of\nthe soul is not fully evolved, but even when the soul has come to\nfull consciousness, it is still said to be enveloped by ignorance be-\ncause this fully evolved consciousness does not make the soul Self-\nconscious instantaneously . On the contrary , when the consciousness\nof the soul is fully evolved the soul begins to identify itself as a\nhuman being.\nWhile the consciousness of the soul associates itself with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm it experiences and exhausts the im-\np ressions of the most-last species of the vegetable-form. When all\nthe impressions of the most-last species of vegetable-form are com-\npletely exhausted or spent through the diverse experiences had by\nthe soul while identiﬁed with the most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm ,\nthen this most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm is dropped or dissociated\nand the soul is once again without any form although it is conscious\nof the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm .\nThese impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of worm - f o rm must\nbe experienced and exhausted. Therefore the consciousness of the\nsoul associates itself with another appropriate medium and tends\nthe soul to identify with the most-next species of worm - f o rm. This\nmedium of the most-next species of wor m - f o rm is nothing other\nthan the consolidated mould of the impressions of the most-ﬁ r s t\nspecies of worm-form.\nSpecies after species of wor m - f o rm are thus moulded and\nd ropped while the consciousness of the soul rapidly evolves thro u g h\nexperiencing the varied impressions of worm - f o rms through diverse\nspecies of worm - f o rm s .\nWhen the conscious soul is worm-conscious and experiences\nitself as a worm in the gross world, the consciousness of the soul\nInitial Urge 19\n\nalso has for the ﬁrst time the experience of voluntary movement,\nand also experiences that it is an animate cr e a t u re. This wor m -\nconscious soul in its travail to gain more and greater conscious-\nness also experiences itself in the gross world as an inver t e b r a t e ,\nand at a later stage in other states of vertebrate, limbless, cre e p i n g\nw o rm - f o rms of diverse species. In other diverse species of wor m -\nf o rm the consciousness of the soul undergoes further varied expe-\nriences of voluntary movement through crawling, through pairs\nof legs and sometimes through multiple pairs of legs, and somet i m e s\nt h rough pairs of legs and pairs of wings. Sometimes the wor m -\nconscious soul in varied species of wor m - f o rm realizes itself as\np o ssessing a hairy surface, sometimes a smooth and silky and some-\ntimes a rough or scaly surface (hide). The worm-conscious soul also\nrealizes more acutely that it has to struggle for its sustenance and\nalso for its survival, and that it is endowed with sensation and life.\nThis worm-conscious soul, with further evolution of con-\nsciousness through greater and varied innumerable experiences\nof varied and multiple impressions of varied species of worm - f o rm ,\nalso experiences and realizes that it is an amphibian—that it has\nnot only voluntary movement on earth but also freedom and mo-\nbility in water.\nFor our own convenience in understanding the evolution of con-\nsciousness more clearly , we include in the worm - f o rm the varied\nspecies of worms, varied species of insects, varied species of r e p-\ntiles and varied species of amphibia. In short, we include in the\nw o rm - f o rm all species that tend to crawl or that crawl in spite of\nh a ving limbs, legs and wings, or that are otherwise distinct fr o m\nb i rds and quadru p e d s .\nThe stone- and metal-forms had no upright or erect stand.\nThey were recumbent forms. Their posture was ﬂat and horizontal.\nThe vegetable-form had an upright, erect stand. Now the wor m -\nform is again of the recumbent type of form which has no upright\nor erect stand but is prone to have a prostrate posture.\nWhen the consciousness of the soul associates itself with the\nmost-last species of worm - f o rm after experiencing all the impre s-\nsions of the varied species of worm-form, and when the conscious\nsoul eventually drops or sheds this most-last species of worm - f o rm\n20 God Speaks\n\nafter ages and cycles of multiple diverse experiences in the gr o s s\nworld, the conscious soul again ﬁnds itself without any association\nor identiﬁcation with forms. But the consciousness of the soul is now\nc e n t red in the impressions of the most-last species of worm - f o rm just\nshed. These impressions must necessarily be exhausted thr o u g h\nexperience, and to get experience a suitable medium is necessary .\nT h e re f o re the consciousness of the soul, being centred in the\ni m p ressions of the most-last species of worm - f o rm, associates with\nan appropriate medium and tends the soul to identify itself with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of ﬁs h - f o rm in order to experience and exhaust\nthe impressions of the most-last species of worm-form. This most-\nfirst species of fish-form is nothing other than the consolidated\nmould of the impressions of the most-last species of worm-form.\nAs soon as the impressions of the most-last species of the worm -\nf o rm are exhausted through experiences, the most-ﬁrst species of\nﬁs h - f o rm is dropped or shed because the consciousness of the soul\ndissociates from this most-ﬁrst species and the conscious soul no\nlonger identiﬁes itself with that species.\nAlthough the conscious soul is now once again temporarily\nwithout form, yet the consciousness of the soul is centred in the im-\np ressions of the most-ﬁrst species of ﬁs h - f o rm .\nIn order to experience these impressions of the most-ﬁrst species\nof fish-form, the consciousness of the soul associates itself with\na suitable medium and tends the conscious soul to identify itself\nas the most-next species of ﬁs h - f o rm. This species is nothing but\nthe consolidated mould of the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species\nof ﬁs h - f o rm .\nAfter ages and cycles, and after innumerable varied impre s s i o n s\nof diverse species of ﬁs h - f o rms are experienced and exhausted, the\nconsciousness of the soul eventually associates itself with the most-\nlast species of ﬁsh-form in order to experience and exhaust all the\nimpressions of the most-last but one species of ﬁsh-form.\nThus the ﬁsh-conscious soul, identifying with varied species of\nthe ﬁs h - f o rm, experiences in the gross world that it is a living cre a-\nt u re in water; a vertebrate endowed with life, sensation and vol-\nu n t a ry motion; an animate cr e a t u re with limbs (if any) modiﬁ e d\ninto ﬁns; and that it has to struggle for sustenance and for surv i v a l .\nInitial Urge 21\n\nThe ﬁsh-conscious soul does not experience an upright, erect stand\nbut it experiences itself as a recumbent that can never hold its head\nhigh and erect and assert an upright stand in the gross world.\nThe ﬁsh-conscious soul eventually sheds or drops its identity\nwith the most-last species of fish-form as soon as the conscious-\nness of the soul has experienced and exhausted all the impre s s i o n s\nof the most-last but one species of ﬁ s h - f o rm. Thus the conscious\nsoul once again ﬁnds itself without identiﬁcation with any for m .\nBut the consciousness of the soul is conscious of impressions of\nthe most-last species of ﬁs h - f o rm .\nThese impressions of the most-last species of ﬁs h - f o rm must be\nexperienced and exhausted, and there f o re the consciousness of the\nsoul now associates with another suitable medium and thus tends\nthe soul to identify itself with the most-ﬁrst species of bir d - f o rm ,\nwhich is but the consolidated mould of the impressions of the\nmost-last species of ﬁsh-form.\nIn the most-ﬁrst species of bird-form the consciousness of the\nsoul experiences and exhausts the impressions of the most-last\nspecies of ﬁsh-form.\nWhen all the impressions are thus exhausted the conscious-\nness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-ﬁrst species of bird -\nf o rm, and the conscious soul dr o ps or sheds its identity with the\nm o s t - ﬁrst species of bird - f o rm (i . e . ,the most-ﬁrst species of bird -\nform is dropped).\nThe conscious soul is once again without form but it has con-\nsciousness centred in the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of\nbird-form just dropped.\nThese impressions must be experienced and exhausted, and\nt h e re f o re the consciousness of the soul automatically associates\nitself with the most-next species of bir d - f o rm and tends the con-\nscious soul to identify itself with the most-next species of bird - f o rm ,\nwhich species is but the consolidated mould of the impressions of\nthe most-ﬁrst species of bird - f o rm .\nOn and on, ages after ages and cycles after cycles, this chain\nof successive associations and dissociations with varied species of\na particular form moves onwards steadily and pr o g re s s i v e l y, and\ngives out innumerable diff e rent impressions to be experienced by\n22 God Speaks\n\nthe conscious soul. Directly and indire c t l y, these associations and\ndissociations of the consciousness of the soul are absolutely es-\nsential to keep the wheel of evolution of consciousness revolving.\nThe evolution of gross forms is but a by-product in the universal\nfactory of evolution of consciousness.\nThe bird-conscious soul identiﬁes with one species, then with\nthe next, and then the next species of bir d - f o rm, one after the\no t h e r, in regular succession until all the species of bird - f o rm are as-\nsociated and dissociated alternately by the consciousness of the\nsoul while experiencing multifarious impressions in the gr o s s\nworld, and thus the evolved consciousness of the conscious soul\ntends the soul to realize itself as bird in every species of the bir d -\nf o rm. Though the soul is eternally without form and in the Over-\nSoul, yet the bird-conscious soul consistently realizes that it is no\nother than a bird in the gross world experiencing bird impressions\non earth, on water and in air. It realizes itself as a feathered vert e-\nbrate capable of ﬂying in air, and with the help of two legs it main-\ntains an erect stand.\nE v e n t u a l l y, after ages and cycles of experiences of varied species\no f b i rd - f o rm , t h e b i rd - c o n s c i o u s s o u l s h e d s o r d ro p s t h e m o s t -\nlast species of bird - f o rm as soon as the consciousness of the soul\ndissociates itself from the most-last species of bir d - f o rm; and the\nconsciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-last\nspecies of bird - f o rm as soon as the consciousness experiences and\nfully exhausts all the impressions of the most-last but one species of\nb i rd - f o rm in the most-last species of bird - f o rm .\nAgain the conscious soul experiences itself as being without\nany form for the time being although the consciousness, evolved\nf u rther and gre a t e r, is always there. (Once consciousness is achieved\nby the soul, this consciousness goes on evolving more and more\nand can never be lost or devolved.) This consciousness of the soul\nwithout form now gets centralized in the impressions of the most-\nlast species of bird - f o rm just dropped. These impressions must nec-\nessarily be spent or exhausted by the consciousness of the soul.\nT h e re f o re consciousness associates itself with a suitable medium\nand thus tends the conscious soul to identify itself with the most-\nfirst species of animal-form. Through this most-first species of\nInitial Urge 23\n\na n i m a l - f o rm the consciousness of the soul experiences the im-\np ressions of the most-last species of bird - f o rm that was dropped or\nf rom which it was dissociated. This most-first species of animal-\nform is nothing other than the consolidated mould of the impres-\nsions of the most-last species of bird-form shed.\nAfter innumerable and diverse experiences of the impre s s i o n s\nof the most-last species of bird - f o rm through the form of the most-\nfirst species of animal-form, the consciousness of the soul com-\npletely exhausts the impressions of the most-last species of bir d -\nf o rm and then automatically dissociates itself from identiﬁ c a t i o n\nwith the most-ﬁrst species of animal-form. In this manner the form\nof that species is shed by the conscious soul, or the form of that\nspecies is said to have dropped or died.\nAgain, the conscious soul, with greater evolved consciousness,\nﬁnds itself without a form, although the consciousness of the soul is\nc e n t red  in the impressions of the form (just discarded or dro p p e d )\nof the most-ﬁrst species of animal-form .\nThese impressions of the form (just dropped) of the most-ﬁrst\nspecies of animal-form must be experienced or exhausted by the\nconsciousness of the soul, so that the conscious soul should not be\na w a re of any impressions of any form, but be conscious only of the\nreality of its own inﬁnite, eternal state, without forms or impr e s-\nsions, and through knowledge experience the Over-Soul. Thro u g h-\nout the travail of the soul to gain that consciousness for itself which\nwould make it realize the reality of its Self, the conscious soul goes\non and on in an apparently unending chain with its consciousness\nendeavoring ceaselessly to experience and exhaust all impressions\nthat centralize the consciousness of the soul, deviating this con-\nsciousness from the reality of the eternal and inﬁnite state of the\nSelf (eternally in the Over-Soul) to the consciousness of duality\nof illusion of the gross world. Thus the consciousness of the soul,\nin an eff o rt to gain consciousness of the reality of the Self, is con-\nsistently shrouded in an envelope of ignorance.\nT h e re f o re, in order that the consciousness of the soul should\nexperience and thus exhaust the impressions of the most-first\nspecies of animal-form, the consciousness of the soul now associ-\nates automatically with an appropriate medium which will permit\n24 God Speaks\n\nand aid it to experience the impressions of the most-ﬁrst species of\na n i m a l - f o rm. This association of the consciousness of the soul per-\nforce tends the conscious soul to identify itself with the most-next\nspecies of animal-form. This most-next species of animal-form is\nno other than the consolidated mould of the impressions of the\nmost-ﬁrst species of animal-form.\nAs soon as the impressions are experienced and exhausted\nt h rough the most-next species of animal-form, this species is\nd ropped by the conscious soul. The soul once again experiences\nthat it is not identiﬁed with any gross form of the gross world.\nWhen the animal-conscious soul is without any form the con-\nsciousness of the soul is centred in the impressions of the most-\nnext species of animal-form just dropped or shed.\nThese impressions must also be experienced in order that they\nmay be exhausted, and therefore the consciousness of the soul au-\ntomatically associates itself with another medium and this perf o rc e\ntends the conscious soul to identify itself with the most-next to the\nnext species of animal-form.\nAfter ages and cycles of varied and innumerable associations\nwith and dissociations from diverse species of animal-form, the con-\nsciousness of the soul eventually associates itself with that medium\nwhich tends the conscious soul to identify itself as being the most-\nlast of the last species of animal-form .\nAll throughout the experiences of the animal-conscious soul,\nthe soul identified itself (through its consciousness) with varied\nspecies of animals in the gross world in water, on earth and below\nthe surface of the earth, and realized the experiences of an animate\nc re a t u re, usually as a quadru p e d a l - o rganized being, endowed with\nlife, sensation and voluntary motion, and which all the while had\nto struggle for sustenance and survival, sometimes as an herbivo-\nrous cre a t u re and sometimes as a carn i v o rous cre a t u re .The animal-\nf o rm has no erect or upright posture and has a tendency to look down\nwith drooping head. Apes, however, are the most evolved types of an-\nimals, and they tend to stand erect like human beings.\nU l t i m a t e l y, after ages and cycles, when all the impressions of the\nmost-last but one species of animal-form are experienced and ex-\nhausted through the medium of the most-last species of animal-f o rm ,\nInitial Urge 25\n\nthe consciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the most-last\nspecies of animal-form and the conscious soul no longer identiﬁe s\nitself with this most-last species of animal-form. This form is dis-\nsociated by the consciousness of the soul and is dropped or shed.\nH o w e v e r, though the most-last species of animal-form is dro p p e d\nor shed, the impressions of the most-last species of animal-form are\nleft or retained, and the consciousness of the soul is centralized or\nfocussed on the impressions of the most-last species of animal-form .\nThe conscious soul is once again without form .\nThese impressions must necessarily be experienced and ex-\nhausted, and hence the consciousness of the soul now associates\nitself with another suitable medium and the soul per f o rce tends\nto identify itself through its own consciousness with the most-\nfirst human-form. This human-form is no other than the consoli-\ndated mould or cast of the impressions of the most-last species o f\na n i m a l - f o rm .\nT h rough the most-ﬁrst human-form the consciousness of the soul\nexperiences and exhausts the impressions of the most-last species\nof animal-form .\nWhen all the impressions of the most-last species of the animal-\nf o rm are experienced and exhausted by the consciousness of the\nsoul, then the consciousness of the soul dissociates itself from the\nm o s t - ﬁrst human-form and the conscious soul automatically d ro p s\nor sheds the body association. This is called the death of the most-\nfirst human-form. But the consciousness of the soul is now focussed\nor centralized in the impressions of the most-ﬁrst human-form and\nthe soul is now temporarily without a form. \nIn order that the impressions of the most-first human-form\nmay be experienced and exhausted, the consciousness of the soul\nassociates itself with another appropriate medium, and the con-\nscious soul is thereupon inclined to identify itself with the most-\nnext human-form, which form is no other than the consolidated\nmould or cast of the impressions of the most-ﬁrst human-form just\nd ropped or shed. This identiﬁcation of the conscious soul with the\nnext form and those following is called the b i rth of a human being.\nAs soon as the consciousness of the soul associates with the\nmost-first human-form the EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS\n26 God Speaks\n\nFULL AND COMPLETE.* Because the consciousness 1 of\n the soul is\nfully developed in human-form, the evolution of form is also com-\nplete, and no new higher forms are now evolved once the con-\nscious soul identifies itself with the most-first human-form. In\ns h o rt, in human-form the consciousness of the soul is full and\ncomplete. The process of the evolution of consciousness is bro u g h t\nto a standstill. The human-form is the highest and the most sub-\nlime form evolved during the evolution of consciousness. Hence in\nthe human being consciousness is fully developed and the form\nmoulded and cast after ages and cycles is the most perfect form or\nmedium. The consciousness of the soul therefore utilizes this per-\nfect medium to experience and completely exhaust all impre s s i o n s\nso that the fully conscious soul becomes devoid of any impression\nwhatsoever, and thus is able to realize its own real, eternal and in-\nﬁnite state in the Over-Soul.\nInitial Urge 27\n* [Meher Baba maintains that such subjects should no longer be left indefinite,\nalthough he concedes that belief or non-belief in evolution and r e i n c a rn a t i o n\ndoes not in any way hasten or impede man’s spiritual pr o g ress. He tells us the\nspiritual significance of evolution and r e i n c a rnation in the following words: “It\nis the evolutionary struggle that enables the soul to develop full consciousness as\nthat in the human-form, and the purpose having been achieved, the side issues\nor by-products of evolutionary travel (the nuqush-e-amal or s a n s k a r a s) have to be\ndone away with, while retaining the consciousness intact. The process of re i n c a r-\nnation there f o re is to enable the soul to eliminate the sanskaras by passing thro u g h\nthe furnace of pain and pleasure.” Ed.]\n1.
